In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). It‚Äôs amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isn‚Äôt being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable and revolutionary as many of these companies still claim to be. Look at Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúself driving‚Äù being a complete failure in actually delivering what was promised. It‚Äôs recent leaks show insult to injury with its thousands of ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù complaints. There have been no notable advancements since 2017 in AI (with the Vaswani et al paper), but these companies and singularity loving redditors would love for you to believe so. This type of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is nothing but a trend, and an arguably unethical one at that. It has the potential to boost productivity substantially, but it‚Äôs as close to replacing white collar workers as robots are to replacing blue collar ones due to its lack of high level reasoning. True general intelligence to replace workers advances incrementally which is still up for debate if it can even be done at all.

I like AI/ML, a lot. This shit‚Äôs gonna change the world - especially Large Language Models like Chat GPT. It‚Äôs like the invention of the search engine on steroids. Chat GPT [Passes Medical License Exam, Bar Exam.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/chatgpt-passes-medical-license-exam-bar-exam-after-top-performance-on-wharton-mba-final) It will write papers, code, problem solve, strategize for you - you name it. 1 programmer who knows LLMs is worth 4 programmers who don't; learn to use them, or get left in the dust.

But the most obvious, pressing issue is with ‚Äúget some poor asian kid on the other side of the world to do your homework for you‚Äù Chegg. This company has not sufficiently prepared for the reckoning.

I've used Chat GPT for my own Computer Organization & Architecture HW and Computer Science HW (as a learning tool \*wink\*). It's an amazing, versatile tool if you put sufficient details in the prompt, whiiiiiich is why it‚Äôs superior to Chegg.

It can solve problems that haven't even been added to their database yet - like concerning new assignments or material from new professors. You can also ask it to elaborate and explain certain problem-solving steps, which Chegg cannot provide if there's only one solution uploaded - you've got as much as the poor asian kid decided to write down üíÄ

[College students](https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html) are the most significant demographic of Chegg, and the competition of free vs. $15/mo for generally low cash flow customers is a no brainer. If you‚Äôre concerned about the plan for premium Chat GPT, according to [CEO Sam Altman](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-plus-free-openai-paid-version-chatbot-2023-2)  ‚Äúusers will still be able to access the chatbot for free‚Äù post release.

While Chat GPT doesn't have verification of veracity (truthfulness) nor precise equation manipulation yet, we can expect it and competing AIs to pursue such features moving forward. If equation solver-extraordinaire Wolfram Alpha has been publicly available for the ballpark of a decade, it does not seem like a stretch that this technology will be difficult to implement. Google‚Äôs equivalent ‚ÄúApprentice Bard‚Äù is also coming ‚Äúvery soon‚Äù according to [CEO Sundar Pichai.](https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-sparks-googles-upcoming-ai-upgrade/)

# Ok so it seemed too good to be true,

so I investigated to see if Chegg was working on integrating AI - since that would be a potential safeguard to retain clients they‚Äôve lost since the pandemic (their peak when everyone was cheating at online school) has dwindled.

5,RIVN is undervalued and oversold‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leveraged to the tits üå∞üå∞,810,13cn3hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13cn3hx/rivn_is_undervalued_and_oversold_im_leveraged_to/,784,1683632161.0,"Today I want to tell you why Rivian, the electric car company that is best known for moving people down tax brackets, is now a buy.

Scroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.

&#x200B;

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian‚Äôs market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

&#x200B;

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They‚Äôve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn‚Äôt a grandstanding visionary. He‚Äôs slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

&#x200B;

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn‚Äôt have close friends, is cut off from his family and can‚Äôt hold down a relationship. There isn‚Äôt a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

&#x200B;

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they‚Äôd need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn‚Äôt a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn‚Äôt as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

The capabilities of AI tools like ChatGPT justify the fervor surrounding the technology. From clearing exams to posing as a potential threat to several jobs, ChatGPT is advancing at an impeccable rate. Alongside its other capacities, a new report highlights how the AI tool can now predict stock moves.

According to Bloomberg, ChatGPT can now foretell the fate of stocks based on article headlines.

ChatGPT was employed to carry out market-relevant tasks, and two studies about the same were released. One of the studies used the chatbot to determine if Federal Reserve pronouncements were aggressive or meek, and the other to determine whether stock-related headlines were favorable or unfavorable.

The AI chatbot cleared both the above-mentioned tests. This further highlighted how a multitude of text from news articles, tweets, and even speeches could be converted into trading signals.

**Here‚Äôs how ChatGPT was used to determine the movement of the stock market:**

The title of the second study was ‚ÄúCan ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models.‚Äù The University of Florida‚Äôs Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang prompted ChatGPT to pose as a financial professional. Following this, they asked the chatbot to analyze business news articles. Since the chatbot‚Äôs training data didn‚Äôt cover the time after late 2021, they employed news from that time period.

The study discovered a statistical relationship between the stock‚Äôs future movements and the replies provided by ChatGPT. This further indicates that the technology was able to accurately comprehend the significance of the news. Bloomberg went on to share an instance from the study,

‚ÄúIn an example about whether the headline ‚ÄúRimini Street Fined $630,000 in Case Against Oracle‚Äù was good or bad for Oracle, ChatGPT explained that it was positive because the penalty ‚Äúcould potentially boost investor confidence in Oracle‚Äôs ability to protect its intellectual property and increase demand for its products and services.‚Äù

Furthermore, it should be noted that this is not new on Wall Street. Analysts have been using the same language models that underpin the chatbot to guide several strategies. However, the results suggest that OpenAI‚Äôs technology is now capable of understanding subtlety and context at a higher degree than ever before.

Slavi Marinov, head of machine learning at Man AHL, addressed the same and said,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the rare cases where the hype is real.‚Äù

New research from Goldman Sachs indicates that around 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by the rise of generative AI systems. The study found that about two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and generative AI could replace up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers, particularly those in the US legal and administrative sectors, are at higher risk of being affected by new AI tools. This is because the legal services industry consists of a relatively small number of occupations already susceptible to AI automation. Despite the potential disruptions, the widespread implementation of generative AI could lead to labor cost savings and the creation of new jobs, such as prompt engineers who write text to test AI chatbots.

As we can see in the image below, AMD is lagging SIGNIFICANTLY to NVDA in their relief rally. It makes no sense for one to be lagging when they are basically the same.

AMD has earnings next week, and the IV on February 17th calls are HISTORICALLY LOW. The IV are these contracts are nearly yearly lows. I saw a stat its around the 17th percentile with 100 being the highest YoY.

16,$HOOD - A New Bull Market Beneficary,162,14ahw7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ahw7x/hood_a_new_bull_market_beneficary/,119,1686874317.0," Hello everyone,

It's been quite some time since I wrote a DD on WSB so I thought I would share this one. Now, I know it's controversial--Robinhood--but making money isn't controversial and I personally believe there's a lot of money to be made on Robinhood's stock as we enter a new bull market. I wrote this DD a few days ago, the price has moved a little higher since. Some pictures are missing because VisualMod won't allow some of the content from Robinhood's roadmap.

State of the Stock

Robinhood‚Äôs time in the stock market has been an arduous one and not one without controversy. The stock went public in a hotly anticipated IPO at about $36.41 on July 29th, 2021. It saw tremendous interest in the first week of trading reaching an overly lofty value at \~$85 a share before starting to sell off. This sell off has relentlessly continued and in many places, you will find negative commentary on the stock.

I personally believe that the stock‚Äôs price action bottomed on June 17th, 2022 at about $6.84 a share. Since then the stock has been slowly plodding along and striking higher lows, which I will illustrate later in the charting.

I also believe that the stock‚Äôs story is close to turning around and could get more positive attention in the later half of this year. I am going to talk about the balance sheet, cost cutting, charts, and the controversy.

I will be limiting my comments on the balance sheet to lines that I believe deserve notice. For this post, I will be comparing Robinhood to their old school rival, Charles Schwab.

The Balance Sheet

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c8fg6s92v96b1.jpg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0fe0c434b509162b2c24391c34b6dccf4413e4

$HOOD - Balance Sheet

Overall, I read Robinhood‚Äôs balance sheet as being quite strong. Particularly in the amount of cash and sort term investments that the company is carrying. At 5.46 Billion in cash and 1.52 Billion in short term investments the company can cover operating expenses (excl. COGS) for about 3.5 years.

The company has also shared that the short term investments are in <1 year term treasuries. Which is quite a good decision given the current rates. I only wish they had purchased a little more than 500 million or so.

As of this writing (6-11-23, 6-15-23 WSB), Robinhood carries a market cap of \~$8.5 billion as well. Their cash position is nearly the size of their entire equity. In comparison, $SCHW (Charles Schwab) has about $75 billion in cash and a market cap of 100 Billion. I believe that the market is underestimating how Robinhood can deploy that cash.

Lastly, Robinhood is very close (9.41 market) to their book value per share (7.83). In comparison, $SCHW has a book value per share of 15.36 and is trading at 55.0 in the market. I believe this illustrates that Robinhood is quite cheap, even after the June ‚Äô22 bounce when it was cheaper than the book.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6q341be3v96b1.jpg?width=1864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f34eab839b9cdd86e4cb3da66b5f820f25f3022

$HOOD - FCF

Next, the cashflow at Robinhood is quite good and turned positive in Q4‚Äô22. Whereas their rivals are experiencing negative free cash flow during this same period. Robinhood, on a relative basis for this metric, looks to be outperforming during the banking crisis.

During their earnings calls they have also reported a net increase in deposits as well as assets under custody (AUC) increasing by an impressive 26% due to the run on stocks in 2023.

(Omitted because of Visual Mod)

$HOOD - AUC

What I find most interesting about this is that customer cash in Robinhood has steadily grown to $11 billion from $2 billion at IPO. It has been on an impressive path of growth. I believe this is the result of their strong ‚ÄúBrokerage Cash Sweep‚Äù program and the rates they‚Äôve been able to offer.

They have been able to effectively remove the friction between treasury yield and their customers. This also creates a beneficial situation where their clients can deploy capital quickly, while maintaining some yield from their cash. Effectively, creating productive reserves for their customers who can choose to deploy it at any moment right on their app.

It should be noted that since the may operating data was released AUC has grown another $4.4 billion in deposits to $81.8 Billion. (See $HOOD's operating data release for May)

&#x200B;

$HOOD - Profitability

Lastly, the company itself is quite close to profitability. The next 4 quarters are projected by broader WallStreet to come in at an EPS of about -0.01 to -0.03. Any positive change in their costs or earnings could lead to a surprise profit. Such as cash from treasury yield, cost cutting measures, new products, or increased business. The company itself continues to stress, that they are becoming leaner as time goes on. I believe that to be true.

Cutting Costs ‚Äì The Layoffs

In 2022, Robinhood performed several rounds of lay offs. This allowed them to cut Q2 ‚Äô22 and Q3 ‚Äô22 operating expenses significantly (excl. COGS). This does not appear to have impacted their revenue growth and has given them the added benefit of being ‚Äòright sized‚Äô. And to the best of my knowledge, no further lay offs are currently on the table. In fact, their revenue is now higher than it has ever been since IPO at $447 million and is pushing them ever closer to profitability.

$HOOD - 2023 Roadmap

(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)

$HOOD - 2023 roadmap cont.

Now that we‚Äôve talked about cost cutting, let‚Äôs take a look at the road map and see if there are opportunities for fundamental growth. I will list out 4 that I believe can have a positive impact on their business.

* Options Trading in Cash Accounts
* Margin Outside Gold
* Futures Trading
* UK Market Expansion

Lets tackle the first two on the list.

Options Trading in Cash Accounts should continue to grow their existing business. This should increase their revenue generated per user as more current customers have access to more products. Options trading is particularly popular among Robinhood‚Äôs customer demographic.

Margin Outside Gold I find personally controversial. I personally don‚Äôt believe in using margin. Regardless, it should also increase their revenue generated per user.

While both of these are improvements that could turn the company profitable for EPS. They are not as major as the next two items.

Futures trading would open an entire new market for the Robinhood user. I believe it is an incredibley potent catalyst for their user base and will allow their customers to trade more often and in new ways.

>Robinhood advancing offerings for active traders  
In March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant license and, if approved on a typical timeline, we  
expect to launch futures trading by the end of 2023.

UK Market Expansion should allow them to acquire a significant number of new users.

>Robinhood continues to explore growth opportunities, expands access globally  
With an experienced team leading and an existing license in place, we believe we‚Äôre on track for our  
ambitious goal of launching brokerage services in the UK by the end of the year.

To summarize, I believe expanding into a new country, the UK, and providing futures trading to their existing customers they expand their business significantly over time.

Lets take a look now at the charts and see what we can find in the price action.

Charting A Path

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4bicwds7v96b1.jpg?width=3657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e43f8865553f0b084e90f4ccda1037695f21d236

$HOOD - Price Action 6-11-23, 1D

The first thing of note on Robinhood‚Äôs stock chart is that a series of higher lows have been put in. The price action, for the first time since IPO, is showing an increasing pattern in the price. I believe the stock has a classic Falling Wedge which I interpret as bullish. I believe the wedge has formed because of the positive developments in the balance sheet, cost cutting, and the future outlook.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/erv0vkq8v96b1.jpg?width=3685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf2f4868438765f62a9918afbf1bb099731801a7

$HOOD - MACD, 1D

Examining the MACD on the 1D time scale we also see higher lows put in as well as an MACD crossover onto the positive scale. Overall, I read the charts as having increasingly positive momentum. I also believe that momentum is growing, albeit slowly.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/64yu4wb9v96b1.jpg?width=3675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2acf46864c3b116cce6793fc0c9ac9ff8d6c1fe

$HOOD - DMI, 2D

Lastly, on the 2D time scale my favorite indicator, DMI, shows the bulls having taken control on \~May 24 2023. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any coincidence that was the low after the most recent earnings report. I believe the majority of the bears have left the stock as evident by their strength at \~11.5. We also have seen the natural termination of the ADX which implies, to me, that the previous trading trend for the stock has come to an end. A new trend does appear to be forming. It could fizzle out, but that‚Äôs up to Robinhood‚Äôs management.

I believe all of the necessary setups are currently there for them to succeed as both a company and a stock.

Closing Thoughts & Possible RisksThe Demographic & The Controversy

I don't think I have to mention the controversy much here so I am re-writing this section for this post. Regardless...

I believe the controversay for $HOOD regarding GameStop is sorely misplaced and the majority of which is not real. When people 'poo-poo' robinhood I believe that they still use the app. Most of the posts still on this subreddit use it and the proof is in the data, Robinhood is continuing to grow assets under custody and trading volumes.

$HOOD - Monthly Active users

$HOOD - net funded accounts

(Omitted because of visualmod)

This could also be related to the flurry of trading activity seen in stocks related to AI in the past few months.

Heavy Insider Selling

An additional risk is that the insiders, specifically Tenev Vladimir, CEO & Bhatt Baiju, Chief Creative Officer, continue to sell large numbers of shares. This is creating an immense downward pressure on the stock price. If this pattern continues, it could contribute negatively to the stocks performance.

However, I believe that‚Äôs a non-issue if the company becomes profitable. I hope that we are approaching the end of the insider selling.

Crypto & SEC Action

Additionally, due to recent events, Robinhood has pulled 3 of their crypto offerings. I believe this is another mixed risk. While they will take a revenue hit by delisting those tokens, they may end up gaining users if customers of Coinbase or Binance decide to take their business elsewhere. **It could end up being beneficial to Robinhood, but there‚Äôs no way of knowing at this time.**

At the time of this writing there has been no report that I can find of Robinhood receiving a notice on the matters affecting Binance and Coinbase. Robinhood instead chose to remove the 3 affected securities voluntarily.

I believe this is the responsible thing to do and well advised. By taking pre-emptive action they are protecting their business from getting entangled in the matter and remaining compliant with the SEC. This is a value the company has stated a number of times during their earnings calls. I believe their actions demonstrate that value and is representative of good governance from the company leadership.

That said, the SEC could still take action against the company if they choose to do so. Therefore, it still carries some risk and must be considered.

Macro & Last Thoughts

So, here we are. It‚Äôs June 11th, 2023. Costs are significantly reduced and being controlled, notable Roadmap 2023 objectives are close, plans for new markets and offerings are approaching, and revenue continues to grow. The company is just a few pennies away on EPS from breaking even or potentially turning a profit. There is also significant distance from the drama surrounding GameStop, Robinhood, and WallStreetBets.

The charts are showing higher lows being put in place. More positive momentum looks to be coming into the stock via the MACD. Additionally, the bulls appear to have taken control via the DMI on \~May 24th, 2023.

I believe this is a case where a significant breakout could occur. It remains to be seen if it will, but I believe there is a potential trade here to the upside. It is not without downside risk though and that must be taken into consideration.

Current thinking in the market is that we may be entering a new bull market based off of recent SP500 closing levels. However, the macroeconomic picture still remains unclear. Particularly in regards to inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending.

If it is a new bull market, Robinhood may benefit from increased trading activity, but if the macroeconomic picture deteriorates it could degrade Robinhood‚Äôs business and affect the stock.

Either way, I personally believe the stock is in an interesting position within the market. The investor meeting is also on June 20th, 2023.

Trade carefully, trade wisely.

**Original Post:**

Hi all, I'm new here but basically spent all night looking into the [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) and [Kerrisdale.](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/)

I'm long on C3 - so I'm as biased as Kerrisdale here, but apparently, that doesn't keep people from taking their word for granted, either. I have a degree in Finance, worked at a big-four accounting firm, in the financial industry (upper management), and am now a business owner (that was too lazy to create a new account for posting this - that's why you'll find me posting all kinds of UE5 stuff, otherwise. My dirty hobby...)

But I'm a hopelessly logical investor, meaning I couldn't figure out why Kerrisdale's letter to Deloitte yesterday moved the markets at all. So I needed to understand the whole situation better and digged deeper.

I went through C3's financials and Kerrisdale's report and looked at their letter to the Auditor, and here are my two cents on their March 6th report and their letter to Deloitte. Apologies for the lengthy post, but it's a complex topic.

It is worth questioning whether Kerrisdale's attempt to undermine C3 serves to manipulate market perceptions, particularly when considering the firm's history of short-selling and ongoing [legal scrutiny.](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/regulation/doj-sec-probe-dozens-of-firms-in-short-selling-sting)

Let's start by shortly going over Kerrisdale's report from March 6th.

Kerrisdale's report conveniently overlooks C3's unique value proposition and casts doubt on the company's competitive advantage. However, this dismissal seems disingenuous, given the distinct position C3 occupies in the AI software market.

Contrary to the report's implications, C3's industry-specific AI solutions set it apart from the likes of IBM, Google, and Amazon. The company's focus on sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services demonstrates its commitment to providing tailored solutions that address the unique challenges faced by these industries.

The report also paints a bleak picture of C3's growth rates, suggesting that they are unsustainable. However, the data and industry trends tell a different story.

AI adoption is in its early stages across a variety of industries, with tremendous potential for growth. The ongoing digitization of industries and the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions are good for C3's prospects.

C3's ability to secure long-term contracts with major clients demonstrates the trust and satisfaction customers have in its products and services. This contradicts Kerrisdale's pessimistic outlook and raises suspicions about the firm's motives. They basically take one of C3's strengths (their ability to build long-term partnerships and client relations) and give it a negative spin.

Kerrisdale's report attempts to pigeonhole C3 as a company reliant on the energy sector, potentially to create uncertainty and fear in the market. But this claim conveniently omits the company's broader diversification strategy.

C3 has made significant strides in expanding into healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, proving its ability to penetrate new markets and adapt to different industry needs. This diversification not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.

The report also casts doubt on C3's future competitiveness by highlighting declining R&D spending. This interpretation, however, seems deliberately misleading when considering the broader context of the company's strategy and expertise.

Streamlining R&D spending could be a strategic move by C3 to optimize resources and concentrate on the most promising projects. It is important to recognize that R&D spending is not always directly proportional to innovation or product development success.

Moreover, C3's existing technological expertise and intellectual property provide a strong foundation for future growth. The report's attempt to misrepresent the company's R&D spending is... questionable.

All in all, I'd say that C3's unique competitive advantage, growth potential, diversification strategy, and technological expertise paint a more optimistic outlook for the company's future prospects than Kerrisdale's report suggests. As AI continues to transform industries, C3's targeted offerings are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, in my opinion. Of note to me is their [ESG product](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-esg/) \- ESG will be a really, really big thing in the near future, especially here in the EU, in the near future.

My opinion: investors and market participants should be mindful of the potential for market manipulation and misinformation, especially when considering reports from firms with questionable motives and legal standing.

Let's finally move on to what caused yesterday's market movements. Kerrisdale's letter to the auditor, Deloitte. Keep in mind that this is just my take on it. But I think that my opinion is not entirely unqualified.

**TL;DR: Deloitte is the biggest accounting firm in the US, and it basically comes down to this: you either trust a short-seller publishing an open letter going hand-in-hand with a well-timed media campaign at a conspicuously opportune moment (C3 was about to really take off and obliterate their short position), or you trust that C3's financials, on which Deloitte signed off on, are correct. Your call.**

Slightly longer version:

Kerrisdale Capital sent a letter to C3's auditor, raising concerns about the company's accounting and disclosure practices. The letter questions the company's revenue recognition methods, particularly for long-term contracts, and the impact on financial results.

C3 has consistently provided transparent financial results, as evidenced by their fiscal Q1, Q2, and Q3 2023 reports. The company has experienced steady revenue growth and diversified its client base, showcasing a strong business model.

C3's financial reports adhere to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), ensuring that revenue recognition and other financial practices are in line with industry standards.

**As per US GAAP guidelines, companies recognize revenue when the performance obligations under a contract are satisfied.** C3's long-term contracts are structured to deliver AI software solutions and services over time, and the company recognizes revenue accordingly.

It is essential to emphasize that C3's revenue recognition practices are compliant with the accounting standards and have been consistently applied across all financial reporting periods.

In their own March 6th report (page 13), Kerrisdale calls out C3 for their long product cycle (6-18 months). **Considering C3 is a rapidly growing company that closed bookings of about $650 million in Q3 FY 23, it's hardly surprising that ""the company‚Äôs accounts receivable have ballooned"", according to their letter to the auditor.**

With C3.ai's strong bookings performance in Q3, it is reasonable to expect a corresponding increase in unbilled receivables. This growth in receivables is a natural consequence of the company's expanding business and long-term contracts, reflecting the ongoing demand for its AI solutions.

On page 13 of their report, Kerrisdale acknowledges that C3 has a long product cycle, ranging from 6 to 18 months. This admission, coupled with the growth in unbilled receivables, suggests that Kerrisdale's claims are inconsistent and contradictory.

**The long product cycle means that C3's revenue recognition is spread across multiple reporting periods, which naturally leads to a growth in unbilled receivables.** This growth aligns with US GAAP guidelines.

The contradictory nature of Kerrisdale's claims raises questions about their understanding of US GAAP or their willingness to misrepresent financial information intentionally. It is essential to consider the possibility of malicious intent, particularly in light of the firm's ongoing legal scrutiny and history of short-selling.

The US Department of Justice and the SEC are currently investigating dozens of firms, including Kerrisdale Capital, for potential market manipulation through short-selling schemes. I found relatively little information on this, but little or unsubstantiated information apparently suffices. I quoted one of several articles earlier in this post.

Given this backdrop, Kerrisdale's claims regarding C3's accounting and disclosure practices might be an attempt to manipulate market sentiment and cast doubt on the company's financial integrity.

In light of the transparent financial results provided by C3 and the company's adherence to US GAAP guidelines, Kerrisdale's claims regarding accounting and disclosure issues appear to be unfounded.

**In conclusion, C3.ai's growth in unbilled receivables is a plausible outcome of its strong Q3 bookings performance and long product cycle.** Kerrisdale's contradictory claims and potential misunderstanding or manipulation of US GAAP guidelines warrant skepticism and caution, IMO.

I expect Deloitte to back up C3 in their FY 23 audit opinion, voiding Kerrisdale's claims. I think the whole thing is a well-executed publicity stunt by a short-seller that was facing serious trouble from the stock being about to take off. I would have done it the same way. Even including the SEC, which is/was investigating Kerrisdale, in their letter is a bold move, but implying regulatory action/fraud, is exactly what Kerrisdale needed to ""cover their ass"" here and get the much-needed market reaction. Hats off to them, textbook execution.

So that's it. Thanks for reading, if you even made it this far. Make of it what you want, as I'm as biased as Kerrisdale on this."

## The Metaverse is Coming, Later

Meta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.

Staking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn‚Äôt a bad tactic to ‚Äúget it done‚Äù, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%‚Üë](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)‚Äôs approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.

### Reinvesting Into the Business

Meta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\*cough\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.

### More or Better Content

As a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.

Regarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:

* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.
* AI program - short AI created content snips.
* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.

## Valuation

I expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.

As a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.

[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)

Here is the table if you want to dig into the details:

You can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company‚Äôs future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.

### Risks

Meta‚Äôs key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its ‚Äúshorts‚Äù feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*

Meta‚Äôs decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.

The metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.

## Conclusion

The market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.

Meta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.

* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%‚Üë](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.
* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.
* Intrinsic analysis isn‚Äôt always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet. Pay attention to the implied EV/Sales ratio, which is based on a regression model that tries to find out if the market is underpricing the stock. It has its flaws, but it may help.

The day when white-collar jobs are replaced by a big silicon brain is fast approaching. But at least now we have the extraordinary opportunity to invest in the technology that will soon replace us (especially Microsoft, but also Alphabet). My thoughts on this are below.

# Summary

Transformer-based neural networks, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 behind ChatGPT, will fundamentally change the way we interact with computers and develop software. Microsoft and OpenAI have already launched Github Copilot, a self learning AI code generator. OpenAI's technology will enable Microsoft to offer unrivaled services to businesses. While Alphabet is likely to have similarly advanced technology up its sleeve, Microsoft is now in pole position to drive and profit from the AI revolution. In contrast to this, the potential threat to Alphabet's Google Search by the integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's search engine Bing is overestimated. A head-to-head race in AI between Microsoft and Alphabet will gain momentum and produce mind-blowing technologies. Microsoft is currently ahead of the game, but both stocks are great long-term investments.

# A Whole New Way to Interact With Computers

Over the past few decades, computing power has gotten cheaper, while the demand for programmers has exploded. This explains the rapid rise of high-level programming languages like Python, which make programming easier and faster than low-level programming languages like C++, sometimes at the cost of efficient computation. However, even ""easy to learn"" programming languages require a lot of theoretical knowledge, practice and experience. As a result, it often takes armies of highly paid software developers and significant investment to turn ideas into market-ready software.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 1: I asked OpenAI's DALL-E 2 to paint \\""an oil painting about how artificial intelligence will change the way we live\\"" \(DALL-E 2\)](https://preview.redd.it/1lthm3ejb1da1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae4cc7362aaa41fbd16dcdfdbe7efe1a386d4282)

In 2017, the invention of transformer-based neural networks by a team of [researchers at Google Brain](https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/) sparked a second revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models are based on this technology, culminating in the release of the state-of-the-art GPT model [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) in late November 2022. ChatGPT's impressive ability to write prose and even poetry reached [one million users](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353) within a few days of its release.

In the following, I will focus on a single capability of ChatGPT that has not yet received the attention it deserves: ChatGPT is able to program in common programming languages like Python or C++. ChatGPT is therefore able to translate any idea you formulate in natural language into source code. This will speed up all parts of software development and fundamentally change the way we interact with computers. But let's just ask ChatGPT for its own opinion:

>ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate code quickly and accurately can help developers and organizations automate repetitive tasks, speed up development and deployment, and ultimately drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry. (ChatGPT, OpenAI)

# What ChatGPT Can Already Do

To make a long story short, ChatGPT's programming skills blew me away, but let me show you what I mean. Since the Internet is full of code examples, I assumed that ChatGPT has seen an enormous amount of programming problems when it was trained. I asked ChatGPT to write a completely useless and therefore unique program in the Python programming language that would be able to web scrape the P/E ratios of all profitable companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and plot them against the length of the stock tickers (e.g. 4 for ""AAPL"" or 3 for ""JPM""). ChatGPT did the job in a few seconds and wrote the program in 31 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments). The first version returned an error message. When I told ChatGPT about it, it automatically identified the error and corrected the program accordingly. In the end, the program returned the desired plot, even with the correct axis labels (Fig. 2). Not only does ChatGPT produce surprisingly elegant code, it also adds informative comments to improve readability (e.g. ""Define the Dow Jones Industrial Index tickers""). Comments are non-executed annotations in the source code of a program to explain to a human reader, for example, what a piece of code is supposed to do.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 2: A useless program developed by ChatGPT: DJIA P\/E ratios vs. stock ticker length.](https://preview.redd.it/5mdvjmarb1da1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=140cbc93f43fc45b2aca777f7ab6184af01cfd0e)

That was impressive, but more of a script than a real program. Hence task number two: I asked ChatGPT in plain English if it could write an ant simulation with the following specifications: The simulated ants should start from random positions and move randomly across the screen. They should leave a scent trail (which dissipates after a time *t*) and be able to smell scent trails within a radius *r*. If an ant smells a scent trail, it will follow it. It took ChatGPT three attempts to solve this task in 89 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments), but the result was stunning (Fig. 3).

&#x200B;

[Fig. 3: An ant simulation in Python using Pygame developed by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The ants \(black dots\) leave a scent trail as they move \(light grey\).](https://preview.redd.it/yup6wi5ub1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69bc30a180cd09b81eae3b9e4a3e5807acb7dc3f)

Of course, programming is more than just formulating correct commands in a given programming language: Programs should be designed to be clear and maintainable. A whole discipline (software engineering) deals with the proper design of software. Today, object-oriented programming is by far the most widely used concept for structuring programs. Don't think that ChatGPT wrote some [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). On the contrary, the ant simulation was based on an arbitrarily extensible ant class (classes are a basic concept in object-oriented programming).

I think it's becoming clear what we're dealing with here: ChatGPT is a giant step towards a completely new way of developing software. While until recently a programmer had to strictly follow the rules and syntax of programming languages, ChatGPT allows you to convert plain English into computer programs. This will make it exponentially faster and cheaper to implement new ideas. Programmers will be able to work with breathtaking efficiency and will be able to focus more on other tasks, such as optimization, since large parts of the software can be written automatically.

# OpenAI's Technology Puts Microsoft in Pole Position

Microsoft (MSFT) invested [$1 billion in OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/) in 2019, without disclosing its stake in the company. Considering OpenAI's advanced technology, it was a brilliant move. A year earlier, Microsoft [acquired Github](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) for $7.5 billion. You can think of [Github](https://github.com/) as a giant ""database"" of source code, which of course can be used to train AI. Microsoft has already built its own AI application using [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) and trained it with the ""billions of lines of code"" stored in Github repositories: [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), which was announced in 2021 and released in 2022 as a plug-in for Microsoft's own Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) or others such as Jetbrains IDEs. Once installed, Github Copilot integrates intuitively into a programmer's workflow: she simply needs to write a desired functionality as a natural language comment in a program's source code, and Copilot will automatically generate code accordingly. As if that weren't impressive enough, Copilot learns and adapts to a programmer's unique style. While ChatGPT is not yet monetized, Github Copilot is already available as a paid service for both individuals and [businesses](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business). Using OpenAI's technology to enhance Github Copilot is the next logical step, which is another reason why it shouldn't surprise anyone that Microsoft is reportedly planning another [$10 billion investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html) in ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI.

With the launch of Github Copilot for Business, Microsoft offers a B2B solution for automated code generation. Considering the global shortage of skilled programmers and the current cost-cutting and layoffs in the tech industry, automated code generation is an attractive way to increase efficiency. This creates a whole new market for Microsoft.

It should be mentioned here that AI code generation also raises new copyright issues. The first [copyright lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data) was filed against Microsoft, OpenAI and Github in November 2022. Since every AI model currently in existence must ultimately be trained with pre-existing human-written code, this could result in copyright problems. On the other hand, there is a huge amount of open source code available under very permissive licenses that can be used to train an AI. Moreover, the same problem exists with human-written code. There is a running joke among developers that programming consists mainly of assembling code snippets from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a very popular site for solving programming problems). Every new disruptive technology raises fundamental ethical and legal questions. I doubt that technological progress can be stopped in the long run, even if there is a risk here in the short to medium term.

# What about Alphabet?

While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) continues to develop its own AI code generator away from the public eye. That doesn't mean Alphabet doesn't have advanced algorithms up its sleeve. In 2014, [Alphabet/Google acquired DeepMind](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind), one of the market leaders in artificial intelligence at that time. In December 2022, DeepMind researchers published their progress in developing AI code generation and made the [cover of the prestigious journal *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158). DeepMind's AI AlphaCode reached the top 54.3% in programming competitions. It should be noted that this paper was submitted in April 2022, so the presented results reflect the state of development at least about 9 months ago.

AlphaCode solved competitive tasks on the Codeforces platform, which are posed in longer texts (Fig. 4), and produced better results than 54.3% of human participants. If we assume that rather experienced programmers participate in such contests, this result is overwhelming.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 4: DeepMind's AlphaCode in action solving the \\""Running for Gold\\"" problem. The expression that AlphaCode is currently focusing on are highlighted. \(https:\/\/alphacode.deepmind.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhxzrcq5c1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c57623df7029b01caa4000463f38c10a991a9fb)

To compare AlphaCode with ChatGPT, I asked ChatGPT if it could find a solution to the ""Running for Gold"" problem in C++ (Fig. 4.). ChatGPT immediately found a solution - a correct one as far as I could test it. However, I do not know if ChatGPT has seen this exact problem and solution before during its training.

While AlphaCode's ability to solve algorithmic problems is impressive, the majority of programmers' daily work does not involve creating fancy algorithms. Today's mobile or web apps are mostly built using open source libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), where a lot of functionality is already built in and does not need to be written from scratch. Github Copilot has been trained on huge amounts of source code from applications using these libraries and is already fluent in them.

# Microsoft's Bing is Unlikely to Challenge Google Search in the Short Term

Microsoft is reportedly planning to use the technology behind [ChatGPT to improve its Bing search engine](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-working-on-chatgpt-powered-bing-in-challenge-to-google?irclickid=14syV4RjKxyNWT9W9ywHf2h8UkAwMeVfcQCh3A0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&utm_term=businessinsider.com). Given the popularity of ChatGPT, this would be a major attack on Alphabet's Google Search, but I would be cautious here. A single dialog with ChatGPT currently causes compute costs in the [single-digit cents range](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599671496636780546). OpenAI founder Sam Altman recently called the computational cost ""[eye-watering](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665)"". Using ChatGPT to improve Bing may be a way to create a great search engine, but probably not a profitable one. With Google Search, Alphabet operates a search engine of unparalleled scale. It is questionable whether Microsoft could scale ChatGPT and make this technology available for every search query on Bing at the scale that Google Search is used in the short term. And in the long run, I expect Alphabet to be able to build a comparable transformer-based neural network model into Google Search.

# Microsoft Has Just Begun to Integrate OpenAI's Technology Into Its Ecosystem

In October 2022, Microsoft announced that it would integrate OpenAI's [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) image generator into its new [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) app. Just as ChatGPT can translate plain English into source code, DALL-E 2 can translate plain English into images. The results are impressive, there seem to be no limits to digitally depict the human imagination. In addition, you can have your own images processed by DALL-E 2 using the [Outpainting](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting/) feature. In the long run, Microsoft could attack even Adobe products like Photoshop with its Designer. If you think about it, there is hardly any software in Microsoft's ecosystem that could not be revolutionized by OpenAI's technology. Out there are now countless good text editors, presentation editors, and spreadsheet programs, many of them open source. Aside from cosmetic changes, the development of these ubiquitous tools has stagnated in recent years, and Microsoft has been able to maintain its market position only through its sheer size. With OpenAI's technology, Microsoft could once again make its software unrivaled, as it last did in the 1990s. Imagine Microsoft Outlook responding to your emails with a short command, Microsoft Word autocompleting your text ideas, and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations magically coming together. The technology is there, or as William Gibson once said: ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""

# Conclusion

Considering the future possibilities of AI code generation, Microsoft's acquisition of Github and its investment in OpenAI has put the company in a superior position. While Alphabet's AI code generation models are still in the research phase, OpenAI's technology has long left the ivory tower and is already available as a commercial plugin for Microsoft's widely used Visual Studio IDE via Github Copilot. In addition, OpenAI's technology will allow Microsoft to improve every niche of its software ecosystem and provide unrivaled services after years of stagnation. On the other hand, I don't currently see Google Search threatened by an integration of OpenAI's technology into Microsoft's Bing, given the wide technological moats, e.g. in terms of scaling.

Even though Microsoft is currently ahead of the game in AI text and code generation and OpenAI has already developed products to market, while Alphabet is still holding back on its AI technology, I doubt that Alphabet won't have the capabilities to catch up in the foreseeable future. If I had to choose between investing in either company, I would currently prefer Microsoft, but at its current valuation Alphabet is also a fantastic investment. So I have long positions in both companies.

**Fictional Story :** 

\*Opens door in US office ( March 6, 2023 )

( Investors = Legendary Investors )

&#x200B;

Investors: Hey Des long time no see. Where have you been?

Me:  Didn't I say I was in India?

&#x200B;

Investors: No, we meant. Why didn't you come to the party last Friday night hotel? We all had so much fun. We missed you, man.

Me: Well I was just busy.

&#x200B;

Investors: Busy? What have you been doing behind our backs?

Me: Nothing. I was just watching tv shows and anime that I missed. Thats all. I was really tired.

&#x200B;

Investors: You know that we don't believe you right?

Me: Why would I lie to you guys? I have always been loyal, and honest and have given everything to this company.

&#x200B;

Investors: If you have given everything you wouldn't have made a silly mistake you know. You were wrong about high vix Jan. A lot of clients lost their money.

Me: God! Are you guys going to keep it hanging over my head for the rest of my life? I delivered the Q1 disaster and that was the promise I made in the summer of 2022 report. How would I know that the market was going for a huge sideways pattern back then? Also, I took a winter vacation to attend my sister‚Äôs wedding.

&#x200B;

Investors: Nah you were just wrong.

Me: I hate you guys. I am going to the club to meet my friends from the tech space. You guys have fun.

&#x200B;

Investors: Well Des you know we have some information for you. We are planning to use a legendary pattern on Wall street again. Do you want in just like the last time?

Me: But haven't we already used the 7yr one in sept the last yr? Liss Truss had to resign because of that. I think it was the last jutsu in our arsenal. What else pattern there is left?

&#x200B;

Investors: God you and your anime reference. We never get it. Well, things have changed my friend.

Me: What are you guys talking about?

&#x200B;

Investors : \*Shows chart. Well, this is the chart pattern one of our guys drew.

Me : \*looking at the chart. This is impossible. How is this supposed to happen?

&#x200B;

Investors: Well we didn‚Äôt say it will happen but there is a slight possibility it may happen. This is an even rarest of all patterns. No one on Wall street knows about it. They are always late to find this kind of thing. This has happened just three times in the entire history of America.

Me: C'mon guys. You promised we would long America after $3200 and then we were supposed to go ATH and analyze things again.

&#x200B;

Investors: You are a simple guy Des. Go enjoy your free time. We will talk more later.

Me: Sigh! Do whatever you guys want. See y‚Äôall later. Peace.

&#x200B;

\* Leaving office

Me : ( Should I give Wsb a heads up. Hmm )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Intro :**

Respected Traders and Investors,

A very Good morning to y‚Äôall. How are you folks doing? 

&#x200B;

No seriously guys, how are you doing? I really am concerned and I wanted to check up on you so tell me you are fine and you‚Äôre **growing vegetables in your garden**. Tell me you don‚Äôt have your entire savings in your bank account and have some **cash lying in your corner**. Tell me your portfolio is positioned for **short equities + long bonds + long gold** which can help you fight any kind of environment going forward. Every important detail was discussed in this series. Everything! So if any of you are experiencing a bad time then I am extremely sorry. I cannot help you more than this. I mean the whole purpose of this series is to protect the little guys so that big guys can never screw us. Whatever curve ball they throw at us we can easily survive it together against any of their shenanigans.

&#x200B;

Now you guys might be like: ‚ÄúCalm down friend. **Uninsured depositors** are getting their money back. Everything is just fine. Fed is back to printing days. Take your medicine or change your doctor. We need your calm composure, not your Adderall dosage character‚Äù

&#x200B;

Yeah guys I think you‚Äôre right. I am not doing great. **I have to quit now**. I get very emotional sometimes seeing my Twitter feed. This positional trading **was really all fun and games until banks start collapsing**. Sometimes I feel like puking tbh. No guys I am not drunk today and neither have I partied hard this Friday night with my bear friends. It‚Äôs just that all of my **tech bro‚Äôs** were gonna be in huge **trouble** and if going forward **systemic risk** really generates up in the system they **will get laid-off** come later this year.  So it‚Äôs just really sad you know. But then there are my **finance bro‚Äôs** as well who don‚Äôt want uninsured depositors over 250K to have their money back. They are saying why they even put money in SVB in the first place. **Why didn‚Äôt they do research?** So I am still kinda confused tbh and my head spinning. **I don't know who is right or wrong**. But one thing we can all agree on is at least there shouldn‚Äôt be any buyout for equity and bondholders in the banks. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So moving forward :

It‚Äôs been more than two weeks since I last posted my two **‚ÄúDragon King Newsletters‚Äù.** I am seriously regretting my decision now. Why did I ever post them in the first place? I was really afraid and scared of what I saw back then, a **technical storm** was brewing up **in the forex market and especially the bond market** which eventually I feared **would spread across the stock market** and other kinds of global markets as well. Look around you now. All of this really impacted people‚Äôs daily lives. **Forensic experts in economics, the stock market** and people who hold high positions in our society were all over the place, be it on Twitter, Youtube, and Reddit asking questions and trying to **examine the problem through the lenses of financial and tech** perspectives. Everyone on the street has his/her opinion and talks about how **no one saw it coming this early**. The key word is this early. 

&#x200B;

Now some of you might be wondering ‚ÄúDude you saw it all happening in Q1 back in the summer of 2022. You were not right about high vix Jan but you were definitely right about something by the end of march 2023 i.e. **Q1 disaster**. You totally predicted all of this.‚Äù 

&#x200B;

No guys if I am being honest I did not foresee this. Yeah, it‚Äôs completely true this is not the kind of event I foresaw. I saw another **multiple compression ( 16 PE ) meets a low EPS (210-200)**, a basic principle leg down when yields shoot higher. This was not a multiple compression, this was going to be a freakin **flight to safety** trade for the **Banking crisis recession**. This could have easily turned into a **Black swan** kind of event. All of this shouldn‚Äôt be happening right now this early in 1H 2023. This playbook was to be deployed in the 2H of 2023.

&#x200B;

Those who don‚Äôt know what I saw have to **go back and read** those newsletters titled **S02E06 and S02E07** when 10yr bond yields were trading around 3.36%. **People** back then **were saying**  ‚ÄúHey we have a **new bull market**‚Äù ‚Äú**No recession**‚Äù  ‚Äú**Soft** landing‚Äù ‚Äú**No** landing‚Äù blah blah. They even said historically low ‚Äú**equity risk premium**‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything and they have been saying ‚Äú**Yield curve inversion**‚Äù doesn't mean anything either for the last 1 yr coz conventional wisdom would say resteepening of the std yield curve above 0% causes recession. What else they said oh yeah bond yields higher than the s&p500 yield doesn't mean anything either. And then they always kept repeating buy stocks coz no one can time the market. **Time in the market matters more than timing the markets**. And the famous one of all ""**Everything is priced in already**. Even JP Morgan's collapse tomorrow will be priced in. **The market** is always **forward-looking** and is so **efficient**"" 

&#x200B;

What a fucking BS this all is. We have been **fed lies by everyone** in the last couple of months. And if it was not for the Fed and Treasury which meets every week with the top 4 banks this crisis would have resulted in a Black Monday selloff. Btw the market hasn‚Äôt opened yet and I still have some time before I complete this letter. So I gotta hurry. 

&#x200B;

Now I will just stop ranting and move on to the analysis we will be doing here today. I am sure many of you are smart enough to figure out what. No, I am not going to talk about what everyone on Twitter is talking. I mean you guys don‚Äôt come here for things that everyone else knows. You guys come here to get my unique perspective on the financial market and how I see it going from here. That‚Äôs what we do here. We will leave the forensics to SEC, Govt, Treasury,  Fed, and every Economist on Twitter and Yt. That‚Äôs just not how we roll.

Understanding Banking Crisis : 

&#x200B;

There have been many banking crisis ( on top of the recession ) in America‚Äôs history but you have to understand that Dow Jones only go as far as 26 May 1896. That means the models you will be creating for your organizations and your clients will not take into account many banking crisis before that. So in layman's terms, the industry std is basically a -50% drop in a recession with a banking crisis on top of it. A normal recession will always be -30% but a deep recession goes -37% on avg meanwhile a shallow one is -25%.

&#x200B;

So let‚Äôs first verify this statement of a -50% drop in a recession involving a banking crisis. 

&#x200B;

Theory : 

&#x200B;

>The Panic of 1907, also known as the Knickerbocker Crisis, was a financial crisis that occurred in the United States in 1907. The crisis began in October of that year and lasted until early November. The panic was caused by a number of factors, including the failure of several banks and trust companies, a run on the banks by depositors, and a shortage of cash reserves.  
>  
>  
>  
>One of the main causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the United States. During the years leading up to 1907, there was a boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
>  
>  
>  
>Another factor that contributed to the crisis was the proliferation of trust companies. Trust companies were similar to banks in that they accepted deposits and made loans, but they were not subject to the same regulations as banks. As a result, many trust companies engaged in risky lending practices, which left them vulnerable to financial shocks.  
>  
>  
>  
>The crisis began on October 21, 1907, when the Knickerbocker Trust Company, one of the largest trust companies in New York City, announced that it was insolvent. This caused panic among depositors, who rushed to withdraw their money from other banks and trust companies. This, in turn, led to a shortage of cash reserves, which made it difficult for banks to meet the demand for withdrawals.  
>  
>  
>  
>To prevent the crisis from spreading further, a group of bankers, led by J.P. Morgan, intervened. They provided loans to struggling banks and trust companies and persuaded other bankers to do the same. They also organized a consortium of banks, known as the Clearing House Association, which agreed to lend money to any member bank that was in need.  
>  
>  
>  
>Through these actions, the bankers were able to restore confidence in the financial system, and the crisis began to subside. However, the crisis had a significant impact on the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose. The crisis also led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  
>  
>  
>  
>In conclusion, the 1907 banking crisis in America was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, risky lending practices, and the proliferation of unregulated trust companies. The crisis led to a run on the banks and a shortage of cash reserves, which threatened to spread throughout the financial system. However, the crisis was ultimately contained by the intervention of a group of bankers, who provided loans and restored confidence in the system.

Technicals :

Now that we know a little about the Panic of 1907 from our friend AI. It‚Äôs time to observe it through the lens of technicals. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ff73zrlbpgna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23839bf996be8561913e4e270ce8420497fd7233

&#x200B;

What we can observe here is recession was about to have a -26.81% drop and then we were supposed to have a new bull market after bouncing from 200wMA but then because of the banking crisis on top of it the drop was almost -50%. The exact number would be -48.54%. So how do we identify when the banking crisis will hit on top of the recession? Well, look no further than 200wMA in DJI. When price action comes visit it 2nd time you need to remember it acts like a quick sand and then you know you are going to have dark ages all over again. Now it‚Äôs entirely up to you if you chose to fight the dark ages or not with the help of flip-flopping Federal Reserve behind your back. 

&#x200B;

To summarize if you observe the recession drop was -26.81% ( wave 1 down ) and then another -28.16% ( wave 5 down ) for the banking crisis. The overall drop was = -48.54%. Wave 2 to 3 of -18.56% was just a confirmation wave that we are going to have a banking crisis. Easy peasy right.

&#x200B;

>The 1929-1932 banking crisis, also known as the Great Depression, was a severe economic downturn that occurred in the United States and other parts of the world during the 1930s. The crisis was triggered by the stock market crash of 1929, which led to a sharp decline in economic activity and widespread unemployment.

>The decline in stock prices had a ripple effect throughout the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose sharply.

Technicals :

Now that we know about the Banking crisis of the Great Depression with the help of our AI friend. Let‚Äôs look at technicals, shall we? Don't be scared.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l0h4vj5dqgna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba6f59a9eae7983dd8c51efd9101e69c7c976ba2

I am sure many guys on Twitter or Reddit or Youtube have already bored you with this pattern which totally looks like a period from 2000-2022. But these folks have no clue how to use it. Allow me to show you how. Just like the prev pattern we had a -46.20% drop for recession. The reason we had the drop this much was due to the fact that it was a gigantic super-bubble. That‚Äôs why it was 2x amplified. So you have to divide everything by 2. Hence 23.10% seems fair for a drop till 200wMA i.e a recessionary drop. Then again we had a rally up which btw in the textbook is called back to normal. It was only a few months later that we realized ‚Äúoh uh‚Äù there is going to be a banking crisis on top of it. Hence the stock market came to test 200wMA a second time. Just like prev 1907 times the MA acted like quicksand. Hence initiated the financial crisis drop on top of it in wave 5. The overall drop had to be -45 to -50% but it was amplified by a factor of 2 hence the drop was almost -90%.

Theory : 

&#x200B;

>The 2008 banking crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis, was a severe economic downturn that began in the United States and quickly spread throughout the world. The crisis was triggered by a number of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments.  
>  
>The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the widespread issuance of subprime mortgages to borrowers who were unlikely to be able to repay them. These mortgages were then packaged together and sold as securities to investors, many of whom were not aware of the risks involved. When many of these borrowers defaulted on their loans, the value of these securities plummeted, which led to a crisis in the financial markets.  
>  
>The securitization of mortgages and the use of complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs), also contributed to the crisis. These instruments were used to spread the risk of default across multiple parties, but they were often poorly understood and underregulated, which led to a systemic breakdown in the financial system.  
>  
>The crisis began in the US housing market but quickly spread to other parts of the economy. Many large financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG, were heavily exposed to these complex financial instruments and suffered massive losses as a result. As these institutions began to fail, there was a panic among investors and depositors, which led to a shortage of liquidity in the financial system.  
>  
>To address the crisis, the US government and other governments around the world implemented a number of measures. The US government passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided funds to troubled financial institutions in exchange for equity stakes. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and stabilizing the financial system. Central banks around the world also implemented similar measures.  
>  
>The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy, and many countries experienced a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape, with many governments implementing stricter regulations on financial institutions and complex financial instruments.  
>  
>In conclusion, the 2008 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments. The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy and led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape. The crisis highlighted the need for better risk management and regulation in the financial sector, and it continues to have an impact on the way that governments and financial institutions approach economic policy.

Technicals: 

It's the same thing happening over here and most of us have probably lived it when we were young. If you were not even born when this was happening I suggest kindly step out of the market. This analysis is just not meant for you 14yr olds.

2022 :  

&#x200B;

Well, let's see how this turns out. But the one thing you guys can expect from this is that the bubble really is not in SPX and DJI. I have been saying this since last summer. It's the Nasdaq that needs to die. Yeah, tech buddies you guys need to go. Tech is a boom-bust cycle of 20yrs. You have to come to terms with this. You just cannot escape your fate. It's just like your crypto buddies who were not able to escape their 4yrs fate. So I humbly request you to kindly give up. You are just overloading the banking system.

&#x200B;

 

**Conclusions** : 

The banking Crisis Recession can be categorized into 5 wave principles. No, I am not trying to do an Elliot wave here. So please advanced technical traders do not get confused.

&#x200B;

Wave 1 : ( 200wMA I )

Recessionary drop.

&#x200B;

Wave 2 :  ( Big Impulse I )

Impulse up i.e. Back to Normal.

&#x200B;

Wave 3 : ( 200wMA II )

Confirmation signal for Banking Crisis coming where the quicksand happens and 200wMA acts like a magnet.

&#x200B;

Wave 4 : ( Short Impulse II )

Small impulse up till 200wMA as resistance.

&#x200B;

Wave 5 : ( Thee final Drop )

The Banking Crisis Unleashed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|Wave 1|Wave 2|Wave 3 |Wave 4|Wave 5|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1907|\-26.81%|\+12.78%|\-18.56%|\+6.70%|\-28.26%|\-48.54%|
|1929|\-49.40%|\+52.16%|\-30.11%|\+19.00%|\-83.59%|\-89.49%|
|2008|\-18.05%|\+12.91%|\-17.58%|\+9.60%|\-45.48%|\-54.43%|
|2022|\-22.44%|\+21.11%|?|?|?|?|
|(1907+2008) /2|\-22.43%||\-18.07%||\-36.87%||
|Average of three prev||||||\-64.15%|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If we are expecting a banking crisis this year then the overall markets should drop greater than -45% but less than -64.15% ( average of three crashes). Do remember that the rough industry std is -50% but if I were to pick a random arbitrary number I would pick :

2022-23 overall DJI drop should be = -51.485% ( avg of 1907 and 2008 )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Result :** 

This pattern will take time to activate. I can attach timestamps to it but I don‚Äôt think it would be necessary. All you have to understand is the wave-like price action 12345 and make your own decision on which wave you will trade. I cannot keep helping you guys. It‚Äôs about time you learn to catch fish yourself and stop complaining. Positional trading is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and it requires a lot of patience. Most people don‚Äôt have this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Invalidation :** 

Every theory must have an invalidation. This is the one for me. What if we go up from here and only to crash later in Oct 2008? ( Hint: Quadruple Witching of March, Sept Low Liquidity attack which Fed still doesn't understand. )

People who read my past posts : 

&#x200B;

""Desmond you are a traitor. Why did you sell off $FAZ etf. We were going to crush banks with you. We trusted you man. How could you do this to us""

&#x200B;

Yeah guys I am not interested in crushing banks and hence took profits. I have told you all this before it is my personal vendetta and hence it shouldn't be yours. The question you should be asking is why is SPX short low. Well, folks, I wanted to reduce my position to get a better avg price so that any rallies that may come will be faded using that cash balance. As for bonds yah I sold them to buy more JD, 3x Chinese etf, and some gold miners' stocks. Overall my short position must be in the range of 50-60% now. I haven't calculated it coz I am writing this letter way fast.

P.s. Rumors are circulating around that your trading brokers may go insolvent Ex : Schwab, Robinhood, TD, etc. Now I don't know the full truth about it but I would advise you guys to not go all in with your savings in any broker. When the banking crisis hit you have no idea who is underwater and playing with customers' deposits. Let's just be clear it's just a rumor I heard on Twitter and no way i can prove it.

&#x200B;

Important message :

Many new people don't know that I started this portfolio with $100 in Wall Street Newsletter in the hopes I will turn it into $10,000 in no time without using any options. So basically by predicting all bear market rallies with you guys, it grew $430+. I wish I had access to the US options market but I just don't.

**Closing thoughts :** 

No one really knows what is going to happen. If someone really knows what will happen please do comments down below. I really wanna know your theory going up for 2023. 

But today i am going to tell you a story and maybe you can draw some lessons from it. So the thing is my sister is at a medical university who paid x amt of money until the completion of her 4yrs. The authorities over there are now telling students to pay an additional same x amt more fees during their final internship phase otherwise they would not receive their medical degree. ( Maybe they are underwater in the financial market as well xD ) The message I wanted to convey to you guys from this story is that fraud, corruption and all sorts of dirty things are going to start happening from this yr. You thought scam comments in Yt, Twitter, and Discord were bad you guys have no idea what's in the store. So be vigilant in making any sort of financial decisions. Everyone out there is there to get you when the real austerity begins. If you haven't experienced the ""Legitimate things turning fraud cycle"" yourself then you might not be ready for this.

**Acknowledgment:** 

&#x200B;

I would be lying if I said I have never watched any finance experts in my life. So I would like to thank some people who have been really helpful with their research in helping me throughout my finance journey. 

&#x200B;

* Mike Wilson: Thank you for taking one for the team. Without you capitulating this would have not been possible sir. You really are the best tactical trader that I have ever seen on Bloomberg.
* Katie Stockton: Thanks for always shorting SPX above $3900 since Nov 2nd week. Also thanks to your friend Liss. You two are really the best folks to watch on Cnbc.
* Market Makers: Thank you, sir. I learned some advanced technical from you. These DW kind of indicators really helps me a lot when I try to put my macroeconomic research on top of it.
* Inthemoney: Thank you, man. You have taught people like us trading options and I wish I had taken the advice you gave me personally that the market can go sideways. Learned that the hard way. xD
* Maverick of Wall Street: Thank you for staying in the Stagflation camp man. It was really lonely when everyone was talking about disinflation. Even I panicked and had to hedge using bonds and the funny thing is I still do. Your jokes in the morning really make my day.
* All in Podcast & Weekly startups: If you guys haven‚Äôt watched it you sure as hell are missing a lot. No words are enough to describe how awesome these podcasts are. Whatever discussion these guys have becomes the talk of the town for next week. 
* Block works Macro: The lineup these guys come up with is really mind-blowing. My fav ones have always been Lyn, Joseph, and Howell. The hosts of this show are equally amazing as well.
* Meet Kevin: Regardless of what anyone says he is still the most hardworking guy I have ever seen on Yt. The work ethic Kevin has is simply so hard for anyone to match. If you are looking for a daily macro research topic he is the guy to follow.
* Also thanks to the anonymous experienced investors who always try to give me advice like having a backup plan, invalidation cases, and not catching fish for others
* And thank you to everyone from Reddit and Twitter who has ever traded with me. Without you guys, this journey would not have been so successful. I know season 2 sucked in comparison to season 1 just like any other tv show from its highs. I will definitely try to improve more in next season 3 which releases in 2028 or maybe 2029. 
* Last and finally I would like to thank all the Legendary Investors in our space. Without your interviews on YT about finance I would have never learned anything. It's because of you folks that I am always calm and composed while i am investing or trading.

&#x200B;

I guess this is how a goodbye feels like. Sayonara Everyone. We will soon meet again in 2028-29.

Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.

Over the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.

The data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/palantir-expects-2023-be-first-profitable-year-sees-ai-driving-growth-2023-02-13/) 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-expands-microsoft-cloud-computing-pact-to-government-agencies/) of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.

However, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by ""incremental commercial headwinds,"" despite ""resilient"" spending from the federal government.

**What to do for earnings?**

PLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it.

Anthropic, a start-up company that invests in ChatGPT's competing products, is only the first step, and Bard, a chat robot based on a large-scale language model LaMDA developed by Google itself, has become the key to victory.

 There is no doubt that Google, as a pioneer in AI technology, is the best in terms of technology.  Bard can use Google's huge information base to provide users with accurate and high-quality answers, posing a powerful threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.

 Under the pressure of rivals, Google accelerates the progress of the AI   war

Faced with the pressing of rivals, Google has invested about US$300 million in Anthropic, an AI start-up, and acquired about 10% of Anthropic's shares. The latter will use the investment to purchase a large amount of computing resources from Google's cloud computing department.

 And Google has begun to accelerate the speed of research and development in this AI war.  According to media reports, Google executives have recently accelerated the review and release of AI projects, and at the same time assigned a team of engineers to carry out new research and development projects to integrate new results into core search and other fields.

 On Monday, February 6, Eastern Time, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, published a blog post announcing that in 2021, Google will begin the development of conversational AI services supported by the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA). Today, LaMDA-driven  Bard will be open to trusted beta testers and is preparing to become more widely available to the public ""in the coming weeks.""

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Monday that it will help developers use AI innovation.  In his blog post, he revealed that next month and March this year, Google's generative language application program port (API) will be opened to enterprises, developers and creators, allowing developers to use Google's language model to build their own apps.

&#x200B;

 This is also the latest decision made by Google under pressure from investors.

Already a step ahead, Microsoft has previously announced that it plans to hold an event on Tuesday to announce that ""a number of exciting projects have progressed,"" which is expected to include a version of Bing that includes a chatbot.

The move has sparked dissatisfaction among Google investors, who believe that compared with rivals, Google has not moved quickly enough to release internal AI tools.  As a technological pioneer of tools such as ChatGPT, Google has not given full play to its own advantages, which even aroused dissatisfaction among researchers within the company.

However, in response to the previous research and development progress, Google executives said that the speed of developing their own chatbots is not slow, and they have adopted a very cautious attitude in the process.  They see this as a contrast to competing ChatGPT, which fabricates information based on user queries.

 Executives also stressed that they must test new tools to ensure they provide objective information and prevent misuse of information.

Pichai also said on Monday:

 It's important that we bring the experiences rooted in these models to the world in bold and responsible ways...that's why we're committed to developing AI technologies responsibly.

Google Has Tech Advantage LaMDA Is Considered 'Human Sensitive'

Google, which has pioneered AI technology, has a large technological lead.

 LaMDA developed by Google is a large-scale language model trained on billions of words on the Internet.  It not only benefits from Google's stronger computing power and R&D team, but also Google's ability to fine-tune the LaMDA model and chatbot Bard through feedback from millions of users.  According to Pichai, Bard can use Google's huge information base to provide users with accurate and high-quality answers, posing a powerful threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.  


It is also worth noting that whether this technology is applicable to the business models of large search platforms is still unknown.

 Chatbots such as ChatGPT could reshape internet search with brilliant answers to a single question, but that doesn't fit the way Google makes money on a search platform.  Google has built a $150 billion search empire over the years through users clicking on ads and links, yet searches for a single question can cause clicks to plummet."

All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. 

Starting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.

CrowdStrike‚Äôs first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD‚Äôs products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter‚Äôs top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.

Moreover, CrowdStrike‚Äôs collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products‚Äô availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon‚Äôs AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD‚Äôs earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company‚Äôs fiscal first-quarter bottom line.

Next is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company‚Äôs guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% gain.

Similarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company‚Äôs outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.

Salesforce‚Äôs first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.

The company‚Äôs ability to offer integrated solutions for customers‚Äô business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm‚Äôs products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.

Salesforce‚Äôs quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider‚Äôs focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.

Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM‚Äôs top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce‚Äôs subscriptions and supported its revenues.

However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce‚Äôs fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.

On May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  

Rangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce‚Äôs quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.

Despite that, Rangan noted, ‚ÄúAs a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.‚Äù Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.

I know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?

C3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company‚Äôs fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.

C3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.

With its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Aside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company‚Äôs $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company‚Äôs business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.

Those initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, ""Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.‚Äù The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.

For the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.

The company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there‚Äôs a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.

As noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.

The Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company‚Äôs consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock‚Äôs near-term direction.

Strong demand for the company‚Äôs Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.

The company‚Äôs first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.

Okta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products‚Äô ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.

Demand for the company‚Äôs solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.

However, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.

Finally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.

Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.

In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.

Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

**So what to do for earnings?**

Just to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I'm getting puts on JWN. I don't expect all of them to hit, I just like to throw my money on the table and see what flies. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.

The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.

With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.

Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains. 

**Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**

According to data from Vanda Research, net buying of U.S. bank stocks soared to $769 million in the first quarter of this year, surpassing even the buying of retail concepts such as $Nifty ([NFLX.US](https://NFLX.US))$ and $Rivian Automotive ([RIVN.US](https://RIVN.US))$ in the same period.

But according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Microsoft remains the stock to buy as it maintains its lead in AI with its stake in ChatGPT and prepares to start monetizing the opportunity.

""The AI monetization opportunity makes us more bullish on \[Microsoft\],"" he said in a Thursday note. ""We believe that Microsoft is in a unique position to gain share in the cloud market while deploying additional AI capabilities that we estimate could expand Redmond's total addressable market around cloud by 35% to 40% over the coming years.""

The company's strategic stake in ChatGPT, which was bolstered earlier this year with an additional $10 billion investment into OpenAI, could set Microsoft up for the opportunity to start taking share in the cloud space from Amazon's AWS offering.¬†

Ives reiterated his ""Outperform"" rating on Microsoft and said it remains a ""best idea."" Additionally, he increased his price target on Microsoft to $340 from $325, representing potential upside of 9% from current levels.

While Alphabet continues to play catchup in the AI space, it is setting up to go head-to-head for market share against Microsoft, especially as the search company has indicated that it plans to incorporate AI capabilities into all aspects of its product suite, including the cloud.¬†

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives recommends buying Microsoft (MSFT) over Alphabet (GOOG) due to MSFT's lead in the generative AI space as the company already preparing to monetize its headstart in AI, while GOOG is still playing catch-up with its Bard offering. Do you agree that MSFT is a better buy over GOOG as this point?"
35,Why I'm getting MSFT calls for earnings.,47,12ytt9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/,27,1682452007.0,"Microsoft (MSFT) will report its third fiscal quarter (Q3) 2023 results today after the market closes. The report will cover the quarter from January 2023 to March 2023.

**Microsoft Earnings Expectation**

Revenues: $51.05 billion. 4% year-over-year growth but 4% lower than the previous quarter.

EPS: $2.23, no change from a year ago and 3.8% lower than Q2.

**What to watch for**

Out of the three business divisions, the Intelligent Cloud department has become Microsoft‚Äôs gold mine nowadays, contributing 40% of the group‚Äôs total revenue with sound and solid growth momentum. In the previous quarter, the cloud services‚Äô revenue increased 18% while whole group‚Äôs revenue only added 2%.

For the to-be-reported quarterly earnings, Microsoft anticipated revenues from the Intelligent Cloud will keep increasing at the pace between 17% and 19% to a range of $21.7-$22 billion. However, Microsoft also flagged that Azure, the cloud computing platform that which is one of the main engines of the cloud business, would slow down its growing speed by 4 or 5 percentage points to near 30% in the fiscal third quarter, down from 46% in the same period last year.

Q2 FY23 Financial Summary: https://i.imgur.com/zNmvSEH.png

**The laggard**

The downtrend in the global personal computing industry has accelerated in the past year. So did Microsoft‚Äôs PC business. In the six months ended December 31th, the revenue from the PC related business was down 11% YOY, while in the last three month, the yearly downfall rate was speed up to 19%.

The first quarter of this year has marked the fifth consecutive quarter of global PC sales decline. As such, it's not difficult to see that this hard-to-stop slide will further falter the demand for all the product line under the umbrella of Personal Computing. The used-to-be-proud King of the PC projected this sector's revenue for Q3 will be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, indicating a 14%-17% decline from the same quarter last year.

**The AI Race**

The battlefield for the AI race has been set up and the smoke is getting intense.

Microsoft seemly led the way for now thanks to its shared commitment with OpenAI to build generative AI systems--ChatGPT has convinced the world in 2023 that, AI will become a topping layer of technology and prompt a new generation of ‚Äúplatform shift‚Äù.

Clearly, all the tech giants are not hesitated to go all-in in the AI race and are ready to thrive in this new age. Microsoft, despite racing inches ahead now, is facing the fiercest competition in decades. Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, unveiled a similar AI function in March for Gmail, which is now used by 1.8 billion people around the world. Apple disclosed that 45% of its M&A targets are AI-related compared to Microsoft‚Äôs 23% now. In terms of the bright minds, Meta has employed 23.5% of staff with AI skills while Microsoft‚Äôs ratio is 21.8%

Additionally, the ticket to the AI race is very costly. Microsoft has boosted its R&D investment in the previous quarter by 18% to 6.8 billion, which, saw its net margin fell from 36% to 30% in the September quarter.

As Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella said in January: ‚ÄúThe next major wave of computing is being born.‚Äù Microsoft is not shy with its ambition to be the king of the new wave, the challenge being, all its old foes are thinking the same.

**Microsoft Share Price**

Despite the bright limelight this year thanks to ChatGPT, Microsoft‚Äôs stock price didn‚Äôt enjoy extra shine compared to other tech titans. But the good news is the price has clearly bottomed out from the Nov-Jan low when the two-year-low was made.

Based on the weekly chat, the stock is currently attempting to challenge the August peak at around 291-296, a hurdle that could open the door to $300 psychological level if successfully conquered.

Conversely, if the break fails, any pullback should be supported by the 100-MA to preserve the bull-biased momentum. However, a fall below this level will risk further breaching the current ascending trajectory and increase the chance of a bear-reversal.

But the recent price movements are not going to play a role in whether it goes up or down tonight. I believe it would be smart to get calls for earnings. I think a MSFT call spread would be good. Buy the 4/28 280c and sell the 290c, which would cost about $277. You could be leaving with 3.6x gains if this goes well!"

**May 27th Recap**

The stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.

This positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.

As a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.

# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day

As the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.

The day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.

At 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.

Lastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.

# SPY Technical Outlook

TLDR (u/[**farmtechy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmtechy/)**)** 

This analysis, viewed through the lens of both 4-hour and 1-hour charts, maintains a bullish bias. The 4-hour chart anticipates a swing low aligned with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG) alongside a significant equilibrium at 415.39. On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.

## A Tantalizing Treatise on The Tastiest Crayons in Trade üñçÔ∏è

Once upon a midnight dreary, the market whispered, weak and weary,
Of technical analysis and indicators, oh so eerie,
To predict the price levels of today, based on the past,
A tale of options, greeks, and the stock market's vast.

In this macabre analysis of option open interest, we see,
Calculations of portfolio-level greeks, Delta and Gamma, with glee,
Simulating changes at different price points, as if by a ghostly hand,
Discovering where gamma is high, and delta near zero, like a raven in the sand.

Some tickers, like spirits in the night, react strongly, it's true,
Off delta neutral, gamma max, or both, a spectral brew,
It is these reactions from the past, that drive our trading signals,
Like a pendulum swinging, or the beating heart beneath the floorboards, it jiggles.

## A Peculiar Parchment of Notes - Wrinkling Your Brain üß†

* If the price has soared past the entry, beware the cryptic change,
  Between the time these plays were conjured and market open's strange.
* Sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest,
  Like a premature burial, exit at your discretion, lest you be distressed.
* Risk up to 1% of your capital, like a black cat's cautious prowl,
  With less conviction, allocate less, and dollar cost average, like a wise old owl.
* Trades calculated before market open, based on yesterday's gloom,
  Keep in mind, new price movements may invalidate the original doom.

$NVDA and $AMD stocks are down 60% in the last year. Is it a good time to invest or too dangerous?

$NVDA started off making chips for video games and now is leading with high-performance GPUs for PC gaming, augmented virtualization, and data centers. Also, getting into new projects with their AI, powering the metaverse, creating EARTH 2 (helping predict climate change), data centers, and simulators in the AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES industry (with clients from $MBG.DEDE to $NIO).

$AMD similar to $NVDA is a semiconductor company that operated in the computing and graphics segments. Some of $AMD's main projects are, Google Cloud Confidential Computing, advancing data centers, discoveries on mars, and the advance of AI getting into smart homes and autonomous vehicles. Also, $AMD recently acquired Xilinx to tap the high-performance and adaptive computing opportunity.

At the height of the pandemic, semiconductors stocks witnessed a high demand and growth, with everyone upgrading the devices while staying at home, making three years of sales in two.

Now worldwide PC shipments reported their steepest-ever decline of 19.5% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reported the sharpest dip of 26.4%.

Many businesses lowered their technology spending due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

Which one would you buy the dip?

* $AMD has a market cap of 104B and $16.434B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 29%.
* $NVDA has a market cap of 400B and $26.914B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 16.5%
* Debt/ Equity ratio of $NVDA is 0.492 compared to $AMD 0.053
* Price to FCF of $AMD 27.635, $NVDA is 83.393
* $NVDA P/S is 14.066 compared to $AMD 4.139

$AMD like $NVDA has a lot of similarities and will probably benefit a lot from its work with open AI and autonomous vehicles. $NVDA has an advantage in GPUs for PC gaming but $AMD has a diverse product portfolio of CPU, SoC, FPGA, and GPU.

Looking at its financials, projects, and company history I would invest in $AMD.

But it also depends on how well  Microsoft will integrate and utilize the model, as well as the competition's own capabilities in these areas.

# How is this tech currently being used?

**Google** has integrated natural language processing (NLP) and generation into various products and services. Some examples include:

* Google Search: NLP is used to understand the intent of the user's query and return relevant results.
* Google Assistant: NLP is used to understand the user's spoken or written request and generate a response.
* Google Translate: NLP is used to understand the text in one language and generate a translation in another language.
* Google Docs: NLP is used to understand the content of the document and suggest grammar and style improvements.
* Google Duplex: NLP and generation is used to mimic human speech and carry out tasks like making phone calls or booking reservations in a very natural way.

These are just a few examples, Google is also doing a lot of research in these areas and is likely to continue to integrate NLP and generation into new and existing products in the future.

**Apple** has integrated natural language processing (NLP) and generation into various products and services. Some examples include:

* Siri: NLP is used to understand the user's spoken or written request and generate a response.
* QuickType: NLP is used to understand the context of a message and suggest appropriate responses.
* Dictation: NLP is used to transcribe spoken words into written text.
* Apple Music: NLP is used to understand the context of a song and suggest similar songs or playlists.
* Apple News: NLP is used to understand the content of articles and suggest news stories that may be of interest to the user.

Apple also uses NLP in other products such as the App Store, where it uses NLP algorithms to understand the content of apps, helping to surface the most relevant apps to users.

# OpenAI isn't the first startup to be acquired

In recent years, Apple has been investing more and more in NLP, and machine learning, it acquired a number of startups specialized in NLP and speech recognition, which could indicate that they will continue to integrate these technologies into new and existing products.

Some notable examples include:

1. **Vilynx**: developed a deep learning-based platform that used NLP and computer vision to help users find, organize and share content.
2. **Spektral:** developed technology that used graph convolutional neural networks for real-time video and image segmentation.
3. **Turi**: developed a machine learning platform for developers, which included tools for NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
4. **Silk Labs**: helps devices understand and respond to natural language commands.
5. **Emotient**: This startup developed a NLP-based platform that uses facial expression recognition to analyze emotions in videos and images and developed advanced speech recognition and natural language processing technology to improve Siri and other Apple services.

Google hasn't been sitting around idle either, here are some of the notable acquisitions the company has made as well in this arena:

1. DeepMind: developed a deep learning-based platform that uses NLP and computer vision to help users find, organize and share content.
2. Wavii: uses deep learning to understand and summarize news articles.
3. Bot & Dolly: uses computer vision and robotics to automate the movie-making process.
4. Senosis: uses smartphone sensors to monitor health.
5. Api.ai: allows developers to build conversational interfaces for mobile apps and connected devices.
6. Moodstocks: developed a NLP-based image recognition platform for mobile devices.
7. Owlchemy Labs: developed a platform for natural language interactions in virtual reality.
8. Kuki: developed virtual assistant technology for mobile devices.

# Trade idea

Microsoft is betting big on OpenAI. Here's a trade idea that will allow you to collect premium but also provide some cushion against drops in stock price in the event the bet doesn't pay off.

This bull put spread will make a fixed 8% (12% annualized) as long as MSFT stays above $210 at maturity (a 14% drop from current prices). Buy 3 $195 puts, sell 4 $210 puts, all exp 9/15/23"

Microsoft declined to provide a specific dollar amount. Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft was in talks to invest $10 billion.

The deal marks the third phase of the partnership between the two companies, following Microsoft‚Äôs previous investments in 2019 and 2021. Microsoft said the renewed partnership will accelerate breakthroughs in AI and help both companies commercialize advanced technologies in the future.

‚ÄúWe formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,‚Äù Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the release.

OpenAI works closely with Microsoft‚Äôs cloud service Azure. In July 2019,¬†Microsoft backed OpenAI with $1 billion, and the investment made Microsoft the ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù provider of cloud computing services to OpenAI. Microsoft said Azure will continue to serve as OpenAI‚Äôs exclusive provider.

Microsoft‚Äôs investment will also help the two companies engage in supercomputing at scale, and create new AI-powered experiences, the release said.

44,AI DEEZ NUTS,37,119on3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/119on3f/ai_deez_nuts/,49,1677127240.0,"**Preamble.**

Note: this is a play concerning C3.AI (ticker: AI). Recent NVDA earnings report is used as supporting evidence. I am not suggesting any NVDA positions, only AI positions. 

**Prelude.**

So it‚Äôs no secret that all the NVDA bears got ass blasted by their better-than-feared earnings report. Even I must concede that it was a pretty good report, especially given that their gaming revenues came in at $1.83b compared to analyst expectations of $1.59b, even in this ass gaming market. They even raised guidance \~5% due to further anticipated recovery in the gaming market.

HOWEVER, data center actually missed revenue estimates, coming in at $3.62b vs $3.85b. For the unaware smooth brains, data centers are where the GPUs that process AI training workloads are stored and maintained. This should not have been too surprising as most big tech companies that reported already told you they were cutting back on cloud/data center spend.

**Stay with me, as this brings me to my next point.**

There has been an AI hype trade recently, obviously, and I am call bullshit *now*. There is nothing in that NVDA report to suggest that spending on AI infrastructure is manifestly increasing \*in the near term\* at all. The conference call was filled with straight up hopium. The reality is that most tech companies are scaling back their spend on *new* data center infrastructure due to tougher macro conditions. Most earnings calls have made that clear. Ignore the hype, follow the money. Enterprise spend is slowing.

Therefore, the recent AI hype rally irrational exuberance. Remember, when you buy a stock you are paying for future earnings, not Jensen Huang‚Äôs hopium laced bathwater. All of a sudden a bunch of normies are excited that ChatGPT can give them a pizza recipe and they think AI is the future of everything. AI was not invented in 2023. These companies have been making these investments for decades, and this hype cycle is not materially changing anything as far as I can tell.

Sure, GOOG feels some more pressure to not shit the bed on execution, but most AI related companies like NVDA are just following their long term plans and acting more conservatively if anything, due to tighter monetary conditions and macro headwinds.

**Oh, did you forget that money is literally not free anymore? This brings me to my final point and play.**

The 6M treasury bill is yielding \~5%. Literally a year ago that shit was basically zero. Therefore, the risk/reward on owning stocks that burn money with no earnings grows more regarded by the day. Furthermore, the economy is holding up better than expected and recently inflation has proved to be stickier than expected, so you bet your left ass cheek that rates are going higher

**Enter: C3.AI (ticker symbol AI).**

This is some shit tier company with literally no moat. They make EnTeRpRiSe Ai FoR HiGh VaLuE UsE CaSeS and their website looks like some coked up incel VC‚Äôs wet dream. It IPO‚Äôd in 2020 during peak market insanity for billions of dollars and is still worth billions of dollars.

Did you know that it is possible for a company to not be worth billions of dollars? That shit may have flown in a zero rate / free money environment. It is not gonna fly now. But would you look at that, it is up over 100% YTD because of the aforementioned AI hype trade.

This is where rational market participants can take advantage of irrational exuberance using \~\~defined risk strategies\~\~ regarded options plays.

**The play.**

Look at the 4/21 options chain. The 20 strike poot is trading around 2.5, likely lower tomorrow due to the NVDA sympathy pump. This breaks even at 17.5 and gives you 58 DTE. AI was trading around 10 literally last month!!!!! Therefore, I believe the options market is inadequately pricing in the risk of a severe correction / crash in this ticker.

This is not gonna be a 10 bagger due to high IV, but a 1 bagger at 15 is easily doable and a 3-4 bagger is possible if it makes a new 52w low. I like the risk/reward and I DON‚ÄôT like this low quality AI rally.

Bear case fundamentals: large scale AI adoption actually makes it *harder* for smaller companies to compete, NOT easier. The performance of AI models depends mainly on the quality and amount of the training data. Big tech has a run away advantage here. Everyone is using roughly the same algorithms. Even your whore grandmother is running stochastic gradient descent on her Lenovo Thinkpad these days.

In the words of our lord and savior Jensen Huang, ‚ÄúLarge language models are called large because they are quite large.‚Äù This is the reason DeepMind (GOOG) came up with the best solution to the protein folding problem with AlphaFold2 in decades, which is arguably the most fundamental and high value problem in molecular biochemistry and biophysics. Data sets are more important than algorithms, so big tech will always win this battle. By the way, AlphaFold came out in 2020, AI is not new jfc.

Bull case fundamentals: they get acquired and ber r fuk.

I will leave you with this quote from a machine learning review am reading: ‚ÄúThis is far from the first time we have seen the use of the term artificial intelligence and the grandiose promises that it implies. In fact, the early 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs as well as the early 1980‚Äôs saw similar AI bubbles (see this interesting summary by Luke Muehlhauser for Open Philanthropy (Muehlhauser, 2016)). These AI bubbles have been followed by what have been dubbed ‚Äò‚ÄòAI Winters‚Äô‚Äô (McDermott et al., 1985).‚Äù

**TL;DR** buy AI 4/21 20p or similar strikes/exps to destroy the AI rally, targeting a 1-2 bagger. Or don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not your fucking mother.

Positions: I will buy 10x of the aforementioned poots tomorrow. They will likely be on discount due to the NVDA sympathy pump."

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)"

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

At the end of a week that saw recession fears resurface and a higher-than-expected inflation reading just a few days before the Fed's decision, stock traders took risk off the table.

The S&P 500 extended losses in the final hour of trading after trading sideways for the majority of the session. Treasury 10-year yields have risen to near 3.6%. The dollar wavered.

Short-term inflation expectations in the US unexpectedly fell to their lowest level in more than a year, and consumer sentiment improved, aided by lower gasoline prices. In a separate report, producer prices rose more than expected in November, driven by services, highlighting the stickiness of inflationary pressures that supports Fed interest-rate increases through 2023.

In the run-up to the Fed meeting, all eyes will be on Tuesday's consumer inflation print, which is expected to show that inflation, while still far too high, has slowed. US central bankers, including chair Jerome Powell, have signalled a slowing in the pace of rate hikes while stressing that borrowing costs must continue to rise and remain restrictive for some time in order to beat inflation.

According to the federal open market committee's median projection, the benchmark will peak at 4.9% in 2023, reflecting a 4.75%-5% target range, up from 4.6% in September. That would come as a surprise to investors, who currently expect rates to be cut by a half percentage point in the second half of next year, with rates peaking around 4.9%. Currently, the range is between 3.75% and 4%.  
While many investors are eager for the Fed to deliver its final rate hike, BoA strategists believe they should be cautious while inflation remains high.

I became a freak in the Google Sheets and Chromed out my whole compute stack. The iPhone was lit, and the Mac worked like a boss. They put my dude Microsoft to shame. Office 365 and Windows became a pain to use. Windows mobile and Internet Explorer were bad jokes. And rip that guy with the Zune tattoo. I had all but given up on my old friend Microsoft.

But then - I heard that musical trill from Back to the Future - and something amazing started to happen. My dude never gave up. He cut his losses. And he went open-source. VSCode stepped out onto the playground and rolled over Emacs and Vim like dogs. Github came on the team and started carrying. Azure DevOps got him sexy in the big leagues again. I even bought a Surface Duo to use as my phone... and now everywhere I go people stop me and demand to know who made my phone. Microsoft, folks. Microsoft made it.

# Background

Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.

# Purpose

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.

# Methodology

Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:

* Discounted Free Cash Flow
* Graham's Fair Value
* Graham's Number

# Industry Outlook

**Overview**

The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector‚Äôs market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.

Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.

Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:

* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.
* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.
* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.
* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.

In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.

It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.

The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.

# Main Competitors

Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.
* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.
* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.

These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.

# Fair Value

Taking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.

**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**

Plugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36

**Graham's Fair Value**

The Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.

**Graham's Number**

By using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.

# Conclusions

**Disclaimer**

We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.

**The Future**

Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.

**Conclusions**

INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.

# Friday‚Äôs Trade Recap

Took the day off.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

>US stocks ended the day with a slight gain, despite Federal Reserve warnings that more policy tightening was on the way. Oil futures fell on indications that the market is currently oversupplied.  
>  
>The S&P 500 index gained 0.5% on Friday to finish the week down 0.7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2% in the previous five days. Trading volumes were low during Friday's $2.1 trillion options expiration, which is typically a day when volatility spikes as traders and dealers rebalance their large exposures.  
>  
>Treasury yields rose again on Thursday following hawkish remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said interest rates needed to rise to at least 5%-5.25% to curb inflation.  
>  
>Similarly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated on Thursday that it is a open question how far the central bank needs to go with rates to bring demand back into balance.  
>  
>Continuously rising interest rates are already putting pressure on global demand. Copper and Oil prices, which are sensitive to growth, were set to fall for the week due to concerns about a worsening outlook. For the first time in nearly a year, US Crude futures indicated an oversupply. Higher mortgage rates slowed sales of previously owned US homes for the ninth consecutive month in October.  
>  
>However, some equity investors believe that hawkish Fed commentary does not necessarily imply that rates will peak at higher levels than previously thought. And traders remain confident that the Fed will reverse course and begin cutting rates in late 2023.

Week of November 21 fluid expectation from option ai.

We are ABOVE the **20 MA (385.82)** and will be key for bulls to hold above next week. We do have the **200 MA at 405.01** and is an upside target if we continue this rally rest of month.

* Downside targets:
   * 395.19
   * 390.08
   * 384.96
   * 377.69
* Upside targets:
   * 401.51

We are near the backtesting failure swing on RSI. Still within striking distance of the 200 MA. It will be key for bulls to hold the gap and/or 20 MA next week if we continue to see downside.

## 20 MA Support Retest on the Menu?

200 MA has been a tough nut to crack this year. We do have a potential end of year rally to 420 - 430. Personally don think we see over 410 - 412 but let‚Äôs see how end of year plays out.

Now just waiting for bullish confirmation for the next leg. Be mindful that this is where we could see a reversal. We might find something similar to July before the next move up or down here.

Upside targets:

* 407
* 412
* 420
* 430

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36a1692e0231e6e13db3c2551ae71f527dfbc24a

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f806155aab9fd81752398686ad7d6f6b62049fa

&#x200B;

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b2417e86d164cbcd433b395f10e4669a0f99c8b)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a03c9400e071a8e576b483fac7b64955933b250d

&#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=26b4e09f4b98d4801594fe8599ab0ebe798612f4

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0454a4a58556c4ceb27983d2c27fa3b5195eccd5)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

I'll have you know that since I posted that, NVDA has gone up 40% and I'm quite handsomely profitable. I still think Nvidia is a winner and I am holding my position. Also an interesting fact is I was the first person in the market to buy that particular call strike/date, but now the OI on that call is 635. Its now the highest OI OTM NVDA call out of any long term dates, and I'm going to take credit for all the other regards that bought into that call. **So a total of $5.8M was invested because of my last DD on just that option alone, and there's probably a lot more investment that can be attributed to my post. You're welcome regards.**

**This post is about AMD's newly announced Instinct MI300**, which is their contender for best AI chip. The release was met with lukewarm reaction from the market, and my guess is because it didn't include ASIC tensor units like Nvidia's H100. However, it still is going to be competitive in AI and it boils down to this:

**Processing speed isn't everything.**

The H100 will blow the MI300 out of the water when it comes to raw processing speed and raw processing efficiency for AI tasks, but the MI300 does have one trick up its sleeve: very high memory capacity and very high memory bandwidth.

**Where the H100 has 80 GB of memory per card, and the MI300 has 192 GB per chip.**

Memory is critical for large language models (LLMs), because the top models now need over 100 GB of memory to run efficiently -- meaning no single GPU can run them currently. You can split up the memory of the models onto multiple cards or keep some of the model in RAM, but this dramatically slows down calculations. For this reason, memory is a HUGE bottleneck for LLMs.

**The MI300 will be the only option for extremely large models (the smartest ones) when it comes out in Q2.**

Furthermore the MI300 has another trick up its sleeve: Its HBM memory is directly on chip integrated into the AMD Infinity Fabric bus, as compared to Nvidia's cards where the HBM is on separate chips on the card. This means AMD inherently can get much higher memory bandwidth. Estimates are 8TB/s for the MI300 vs 2-3 TB/S for the H100. This will mean that tensors can be loaded into the MI300's GPU more efficiently causing less latency (downtime) for the processing units.

More interesting facts about the MI300:

* It is an APU, meaning it has both a GPU and a CPU
* The CPU is a basically like a 24 core Ryzen
* The GPU is like smashing over two 7900XTX's together (its titanic)
* This is one of the largest ICs ever at 146B transistors (The H100 is 80B transistors)

What does all this mean?

* **For non-AI compute workloads the MI300 is likely to be the king of efficiency out of any available products** \-- it will be widely deployed in supercomputers across the world. Their first flagship customer is the DOE, which owns a large portion of the largest super computers in the world.
* **Also for the largest AI workloads, it will be the only good option for a few months until the H100 NVL comes out**

How does it stack against the H100 NVL? The NVL model is a new version of the H100 coming out in the second half of the year. It is basically like a normal H100 that is capable of SLI (NVLink). This allows users to put two H100 NVLs together via a special link so they operate like one logical compute unit. That will give Nvidia a 188 GB option (via 2 cards linked together). However NVLink has extremely poor memory bandwidth which will exacerbate the difference between the MI300's extremely good memory bandwidth. Its hard to say whether the H100 NVL solution will be better than the MI300 for very large language models, but my guess is the H100 NVL will probably be better for most. The MI300 will be excellent for them however, so its likely that many cloud providers will chose it because it is also fantastic for general purpose OpenCL where the H100 is a specialized card.

What am I doing? I'm buying some AMD in addition to my NVDA. I've also bought some SMH calls which have exposure to both NVDA and AMD. I'm at about 4:1 exposure NVDA:AMD right now, but I'll bring that up to 2:1.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks have had their longest weekly losing streak since September, with investors concerned that the Fed's determination to keep raising interest rates will tip the economy into a recession.  


For the third day in a row, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 finished lower. The quarterly triple witching expiration of equity derivatives boosted market movements on Friday as well.  


The performance of US treasuries was mixed, with short-term bonds rallying on Friday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield was nearly 19 basis points lower at the end of the week. The value of the dollar had hardly changed. Oil is up for the week.  


Earlier this week, investors cheered softer-than-expected inflation data. However, the euphoria faded as Fed officials hammered home the message that rates will remain higher until they are confident that inflation has been subdued. While the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, risk assets have been under pressure since policymakers signalled a peak rate that was higher than market expectations. This week saw a wave of rate hikes and hawkish forecasts from central banks around the world, including the ECB.  


Traders also had to contend with a slew of US data this week that showed the economy cooling while the labour market remained strong. This did not sit well with investors, as labour market softening remains a major concern for the Fed.

We read this thing so you don't have to... with the help of ChatGPT.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bosc4qx5s6fa1.jpg?width=781&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5220fb6160696057cf2479a90b3cda717785cba0

 Here's what Google is working on, in plain English:

* **Google is, of course, trying to solve complex problems to create AI that helps understand, categorize, and generate text, images, audio, and video**
* **They are making progress but don't appear to be ready to release any one product similar to ChatGPT, however specific use cases will be spoon fed into existing applications, like Gmail, YouTube, and the Pixel phone** 
* **They are working on Chain of Thought prompting, which breaks down requests into individual steps, and on models fine-tuned for specific use cases, like translation and medical contexts**
* **They want to create a single model that can work in many different use cases, regardless of context-- this is the hardest part**
* **But the most overwhelming takeaway is their insistence on ""Responsible AI""-- ¬†releasing AI in a way that is not harmful to the world so we're not flooded with biased machines and fake images and video**

There's a saying that if you can't describe what your business or product does in a few sentences, it's probably a failure. There's a whiff of that here. 15,000 complex words to basically say ""hey, we're not there yet""... all while ChatGPT is accessible and useful to humans with even a moderate IQ.

Google will release a series of blog posts updating their progress... signaling that no major products or features on the level with ChatGPT are expected to be available for widespread use this year.

Not a great look.

Worse is that the *New York Times* [reports](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZ29vZ2xlLWNoYXRncHQtYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuaHRtbCIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJmMmM0YTM0YS01NzdmLTQ2YzktYjI4Ni0xYjExYjI4OWE3MGQiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImYwYmRkOTRlLWNkZWEtNDYzZS05Yjc2LTdiZTFlOWNhMjZjYyIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiODQ5Zjc1MzMtZWEyMC00MjRhLTg0ZTUtOTVlMjY5YzA1MmVhIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc0MjQxMjMxLjEyNiwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.aWy3Uo61KoSLEWiAhqHiHgxFRG4D0t9ZfpCzBKW1WQo) today that **Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were brought in for Google's ""code red"" moment last month**.

They met with the executive team to discuss AI and adding chatbot features to search, a topic they rarely weigh in on these days.

A slide presentation obtained by The Times outlines a **less-than-stellar AI product road map**\-- as summarized BY CHATGPT!

* **They plan to offer software developers and other companies a list of A.I. programs, including image-creation technology to bolster revenue for their Cloud division**
* **MakerSuite will be offered as a tool to help other businesses create their own A.I. prototypes in internet browsers with two Pro versions**
* **In May, they plan to announce Colab + Android Studio, a tool to make it easier to build apps for Android smartphones that will generate, complete, and fix code**
* **Another code generation and completion tool, called PaLM-Coder 2, is also in the works**
* **Google will demonstrate a version of its search engine with its ChatGPT competitor LaMBDA this year, but it's unclear whether it will actually be released to the public this year**
* **Google lags behind OpenAI's self-reported metrics when it comes to identifying content that is hateful, toxic, sexual or violent**
* **OpenAI bested Google tools in each category and Google tools fell short of human accuracy in assessing content**

I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .

>A recent survey conducted by Yahoo Finance/Ipsos reveals that a significant majority of investors, 66% to be precise, are reluctant to utilize AI financial advisors. Furthermore, almost half of the respondents, 46%, express a lack of trust in AI when it comes to providing financial advice. Interestingly, despite these concerns, there is a noteworthy 20% of investors who remain open to the idea of using AI advisors.

&#x200B;

>However, what investors may not realize is that AI is already being employed in their financial decision-making processes. Digitally-native personal finance management tools such as Mint and NerdWallet, which inherently require machine learning and AI for efficient operation, are already leveraging AI behind the scenes. Similarly, robo-advisors, which offer automated, algorithm-based portfolio management services to investors, are powered by AI. In fact, robo-advisors are projected to manage a staggering $2.76 trillion in assets this year, highlighting the significant role of AI in this domain.

&#x200B;

>Moreover, AI plays a crucial part in other aspects of finance as well. Algorithmic trading and investment analysis heavily rely on AI capabilities. Although humans make the final decisions, AI assists in gathering and analyzing the vast amounts of data that inform these decisions.

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

>I trust you are all faring well amidst these protracted weeks. I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.  
>  
>  
>  
>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, ""The money printer is back on!"" ""We're destined for astronomical gains!"" ""S&P $5000, here we come!"" ""There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,"" and so on.  
>  
>  
>  
>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.

&#x200B;

Ewwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Recap :**

Season 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let‚Äôs first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.

I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.

&#x200B;

I think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let‚Äôs analyze things from a new perspective and let‚Äôs see what markets are trynna tell us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment :** 

**""Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame""**

&#x200B;

In this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.

So let‚Äôs build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let‚Äôs just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So let‚Äôs just deep dive right in.

*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

USA :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)

&#x200B;

The above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a ‚ÄúNegative correlation‚Äù and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of ‚ÄúNegative correlation‚Äù But then inflation happened and that‚Äôs why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in ‚ÄúPositive correlation‚Äù i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.

&#x200B;

But now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the ‚ÄúNegative correlation‚Äù where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the ‚ÄúBanking crisis‚Äù where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It‚Äôs one of the chapters of the ‚ÄúRecession playbook‚Äù that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for us?

Well in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a ‚Äúnegative correlation‚Äù of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.

As for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: ‚ÄúWe are still in a strong Positive correlation‚Äù of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan & Germany :

So now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still ""Negatively correlated"" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that‚Äôs when a ‚ÄúPositive correlation‚Äù emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)

&#x200B;

As for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.

&#x200B;

 

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result:  Inconclusive result.

We should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn‚Äôt just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn‚Äôt everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

Eurusd-De10y :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don‚Äôt get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don‚Äôt wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f‚Äôed then I am hoping Europe will get f‚Äôed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It‚Äôs the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like ‚ÄúWhat are you talking man‚Äù ‚ÄúI am more confused‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust tell me up or down‚Äù Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383

&#x200B;

This is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let‚Äôs not assume anything. It‚Äôs still not clear. We need more data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GbpUsd - Gb10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757

&#x200B;

So now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a

&#x200B;

You can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UsdJpy - Jp10y :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2

&#x200B;

Before talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d

&#x200B;

This is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

DXY - Us 10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f10f62d643d8c56504df1b7a7bf5310f3cfab067

&#x200B;

This is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let‚Äôs check the daily time frame to show what I mean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e22a7875b298311d16e96733065a51c9f472645

&#x200B;

The relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.

&#x200B;

[Monthly time frame b\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9af006387b0c80615490a12dffacac7e5ecea9ec)

&#x200B;

Now I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.

&#x200B;

Result: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Balance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms

&#x200B;

[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)

&#x200B;

As you can clearly see till October every CB‚Äôs were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) 

Now some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7ddbc77e7c082b7bc41e571855b32685a268763

&#x200B;

Conclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 1: Deflationary spiral

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|\-ve Gdp|\-ve %|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But soon inflation will go low :

So, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: -ve

&#x200B;

This means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Time taken :

Normally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this ""Inverse them bruh"" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )

This trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> 3.2%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|God knows|God knows|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But then inflation will go higher :

So, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: still +ve

&#x200B;

Overall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?

&#x200B;

\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.

&#x200B;

\- 2b) Let‚Äôs say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?

Ans: Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.

&#x200B;

Well folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. 

&#x200B;

What if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you "" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all"" 

&#x200B;

This above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.

**Final thoughts :**

The real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Enjoy the weekend everyone. 

See you guys next week!

Yesterday I picked up TSLA 215c calls about 15 min after open when it hit 200, and sold right before close at around 209. Also got NVDA 230c around the same time, and sold when it touched 230. Hope you all Printed yesterday!

On Tuesday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both slipped due to higher-than-expected inflation, but the Nasdaq finished in the green. The pace of price increases was still seen as slowing down, which helped to mitigate concerns. On Wednesday, more data will be released, including indicators from the housing market, and corporate earnings reports from Kraft Heinz and Cisco. Additionally, Tesla has agreed to open up thousands of its charging stations to EVs made by other companies, which could help to further drive adoption of electric vehicles. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs has given up on plans for a branded credit card as it continues to dismantle its consumer-banking strategy. Finally, Wednesday's mortgage demand report showed a 7.7% decline in total mortgage application volume, likely due to a rise in the 30-year fixed rate. Yes CPI is over with, but remember this week is OPEX which means we could see a lot of chop. Yesterday was a prime example of that, but the range of chop was nearly 50pts so if you are trading today, use those relative strong or weak names to capitalize on this ES range.

**Overall Market Outlook: **

SPY - Bullish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We are still in a big symmetrical triangle. And we are squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Looks like we could see a nice move tomorrow! (No levels posted for now I have a bunch of paperwork I have to finish up tonight.) Expected Move +/- $3.71

QQQ- Three White Soldiers candle pattern close on the daily TF. We are now in a squeeze setting up for a move on the 1Hr TF. (No levels posted for now.) Expected Move +/- $3.76

**Watchlist:**

TSLA - Bullish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. We Engulfed the last 3 days! And we reclaimed the 200WMA on the daily. We have a possible head & shoulders on the daily RSI. And we released from the squeeze and made that nice move up! Take 225c or 230c Calls above 216.27. Take 195p or 190p Puts below 206.33. Expected Move +/- $12.39

NVDA- Bullish candle close on the daily TF. We have a tweezer top on the daily. And we closed in big supply zone. We still have a little gap above to fill also. Take 240c or 245c Calls above 231.20. Take 220p or 215p Puts below 225.26 BNH. Expected Move +/- $9.98

QCOM - The stock has come down to test its 200 daily MA for each of the past three trading days signifying the strength of this level. I believe we see a move higher for this chip stock. The semiconductor sector has been boosted by the AI hype, this outperformance should continue.

MU - This semiconductor stock jumped off its 200 daily  MA around $59 yesterday which should cause the stock to continue to move higher with the broader semi sector."

I just got back from a time-traveling trip to the future and let me tell you, MSFT stock is looking üî•üî•üî•. Here's why:

   1. They're making a killing in the AI space. They invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and just recently dropped another $10 billion. I heard they're even using ChatGPT to predict the stock market.

   2. Master Elon is one of the founders of OpenAI

   3. The stock is basically a safe haven, like a government bond but with more memes.

   4. M$ dropped $19.7B to purchase Nuance Communications. Guess what they specialize in? That's right, printing fucking money. If you never heard of them, Nuance Communications is a technology company that specializes in speech recognition and natural language processing technology. They develop and provide a wide range of AI-powered products and services, they also have a tinder like dating app that helps wives‚Äô find boyfriends. 
   
   5. ""M$ and Walmart just announced a partnership? That's like Batman and Superman teaming up, but better! M$'s AI technology is gonna make Walmart's shopping experience next-level, I bet they're gonna have AI-powered shopping carts that automatically add more snacks to your cart and even suggest recipes for dinner tonight!
	
   5. ""Looks like M$ is laying off 10,000 employees? Don't worry folks, they're just automating the workforce with AI. The robots will work 24/7 and never ask for a raise. Plus, we all know robots are better at math and don't have to take coffee breaks.
	
   6. ""M$ on the path to acquiring Activision Blizzard? Talk about a power move! Now they're not just dominating the tech game, they're taking over the gaming world too. It's only a matter of time before they release an AI-powered World of Warcraft and make billions.

In conclusion, MSFT is a no-brainer, a sure thing, a slam dunk. Don't miss out on this opportunity folks, buy the dip and HODL.

P.S: This is not financial advice, consult your therapist before investing.""

""P.P.S: This post was written by a language model, ChatGPT, also known as the AI version of Jim Cramer. Don't trust everything it says, always do your own research, consult a financial advisor and consult your therapist before investing.""

65,TSLA call buying program always goes into overdrive right before Musky dumps,21,xkmx6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xkmx6p/tsla_call_buying_program_always_goes_into/,19,1663808769.0,"The Stans will jump on Enrons shmeckle but the coincidences in the option market right before Musky dumps on his ~~exit liquidity~~ shareholders are undeniable. For example, last week on Wed Sept 14th, 250,000 300/305/10 calls expiring Friday, sept 16th were traded. This has continued day after day and only kicked into further overdrive, it's **unprecedented** this day after day action especially in the face of such market risk. The call buying only goes into extra regardation in times like late April, early August, and now. The former being when Musk dumped shares. It is of course coincidence that the call buying program volume of weekly options dies out right after Elon is done selling.

All the while, Musk is set to be deposed next week for the final slug off in the twitter trial and if Musko loses, he needs the stock price as high as possible. Not to mention, he has been shamelessly pumping on Twitter about absolutely ridiculous shit like expanding a car factory to the river and making it open to the public with ""little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victoria design"" lmao. Don't even get me started on AI day.

I for one can't wait to see the absolute gold mine the comments will be if I don't get downvoted to oblivion, especially from that super special Tesla genereal guy."

As investors analyze Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks, they are also closely monitoring the latest earnings reports. Yum Brands reported Wednesday and was followed by Chipotle's disappointing report on Tuesday. Wednesday will be the main event with Disney releasing its results, with the market paying close attention to CEO Bob Iger's plans to reduce streaming losses and possibly cut jobs. Other companies reporting on Wednesday include Under Armour, Uber, CVS Health, and Mattel. In his speech on Tuesday, Powell used the term ""disinflationary"" and acknowledged that price increases were slowing down, but also stated that the Fed could keep raising rates if the data doesn't show continued disinflationary trends. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it will be using OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, to improve its Bing search engine and Edge browser. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a surprise visit to London on Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and thank the British people for their support.

**Watchlist:** 

TSLA- Dragonfly Doji candle close on the daily TF. We have a triple top on the daily RSI. And we finally brokeout the ascending channel we been in. We are now squeezing on the 4Hr TF. And we are still squeezing for the past 2 days now setting up for a nice move on the 1Hr TF. Take 210c or 220c Calls above 200 or 185p or 180p Puts below 191.81 BNH (or 190 safer entry). Expected Move +/- $11.74

NVDA- Bullish candle close on the daily TF. We brokeout the big bullflag we were in on the 4Hr and 1Hr TF and made that nice move up! Take 230c or 235c Calls above 226.85 BNH or 215p or 210p Puts below 220 BNH. Expected Move +/- $9.61

NKE - Nike came down to test support around $123.90 and held this level yesterday. I believe we see a move higher from this outperforming stock over the coming weeks especially after we got a golden cross back on January 13th which implies bullish momentum.

CLF - Cleveland Cliffs is coming down to test support around $20.40, we held this level when tested last week. I expect we see a move higher for this underperforming stock which just had a golden cross yesterday implying bullish momentum

RIOT - The stock just moved above all major daily moving averages and should really benefit from the bullish price movement from beetcoin. B T C is trading in a great spot and had the 50 day moving average cross above the 200 day moving average yesterday, implying bullish momentum."

In some cases, developers have been able to use generative AI to automate up to 40 percent of their code, Goldman said.

Wall Street is embracing artificial intelligence.

&#x200B;

After Morgan Stanley tapped into GPT-4 and will use AI technology to optimize its wealth management advisory process, Goldman Sachs has also started using ChatGPT-like AI software to assist developers in writing code internally.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, March 21, Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti said Goldman Sachs developers are testing generative AI tools internally to help them write code. He said it is currently in the ""proof-of-concept"" stage and is not yet ready for production.

&#x200B;

Argenti said on Tuesday:

&#x200B;

Goldman Sachs developers are already using some assistive coding techniques.

&#x200B;

Goldman Sachs' interest in generative AI products remains, despite opposition from some banking giants to internal use of ChatGPT by employees. That includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America, which have all restricted employees from using the software at work.

&#x200B;

Argenti said:

&#x200B;

This technology is still in its early stages. We're not going to let this technology do all the most important work right away, but it's imperative that we really try it and understand its potential.

&#x200B;

I've been working with technology for almost 40 years, and this is one of the biggest disruptions I've ever seen - probably comparable to the Internet, apps, cloud computing.

&#x200B;

He emphasized that AI should be seen less as a replacement for software developers and more as a partner to help them be more productive. In some cases, he said, developers have been able to write up to 40 percent of their code automatically using generative AI.

&#x200B;

It's not just Goldman Sachs that has embraced AI technology, but Morgan Stanley as well.

&#x200B;

Last week, OpenAI unveiled six use cases when it released GPT-4, including one in which Morgan Stanley's wealth management division (MSWM) used GPT-4 to organize the mobilization of its client-facing knowledge base.

&#x200B;

For its part, Morgan Stanley also said that it is currently ""the only strategic wealth management client to have early access to OpenAI's new product"" and that its wealth management division will use GPT-4 to ""acquire, process and synthesize content in the form of global company, industry, asset class, capital market and regional insights that will be incorporated into MSWM. in the form of insights into global companies, industries, asset classes, capital markets and regions, drawing on MSWM's own extensive intellectual capital.""

## üñçÔ∏è Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Are Finger-Lickin' Good

Gawrsh, folks! Let's talk about how we can predict the tastiest crayon colors using some fancy-shmancy technical analysis and indicator-based trading. üìàüåà

You see, we're gonna use the current option open interest to calculate some big ol' numbers called portfolio-level greeks, like Delta and Gamma. Then we'll simulate how these greeks change at different price points, and find the levels where the gamma is the highest and the delta is close to 0. üìä

Sometimes, the price of our crayons reacts strongly to these levels, and that's what we'll use to drive our trading signals. üì°

Now, the plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which helps us figure out the expected size and duration of the reactions. Most of these plays are profitable, but the best ones benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV. üéØ

## üìù Notes - Wrinkles and All
If the price has moved past the entry price, be careful! Make sure to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest. I usually risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades, but if I'm less confident, I'll allocate less and dollar cost average in. And remember, the trades are based on info up to yesterday, so new price movements might change the whole game. üîÑ

## ‚ùì FAQ - 'Cause Y'all Keep Askin'
**Q:** Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? üêª\
**A:** Nope! It just so happens that the companies are overextended, so these trades are mean-reverting.

**Q:** Are you entering all these plays? ü§î\
**A:** No siree! I'm just sharin' more plays with a probable edge to help you apes find more gain porn. ü¶çüí∞

**Q:** What if you mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past? üé¢\
**A:** The new play should replace the old one. Don't chase the price, and remember that new data changes things.

**Q:** Where are the crayons? I only see words. üñçÔ∏è\
**A:** Click the links above, partner!

**Q:** Have you back-tested this? üß™\
**A:** Yup! Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate (¬±7% margin of error).

**Q:** What's the historical performance? üìú\
**A:** The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28) üìÖ

So, folks, that's the scoop on how we can find the tastiest crayons in the box! Now go out there, do your own research, and get that gain porn! üöÄüåï"

72,ChatGPT's soaring popularity has added $5 billion to the wealth of Nvidia's founder as Wall Street bets on AI boom for the chipmaker,17,10qzemi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10qzemi/chatgpts_soaring_popularity_has_added_5_billion/,8,1675270075.0,"With the rise of OpenAI's language tool, ChatGPT, Wall Street traders are increasingly betting on chip-makers like Nvidia, which has climbed more than 34% this month.

As a result, CEO Jensen Huang, who cofounded the company in 1993, has seen his wealth balloon by more than a third to $18.9 billion.¬†

According to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, the $5.1 billion gain gives Huang the largest percentage gain to his net-worth among US billionaires so far this year.¬†

The 59-year-old Taiwanese immigrant is coming off a less memorable year, as he was among other tech moguls who lost big money, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk.

Microsoft this month reportedly invested $10 billion into ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, which has fueled interest in the artificial intelligence space overall. The bot has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages.

Nvidia's role as a dominant player in the chip-making space has made it an attractive bet as Wall Street looks to ride the AI trend.

After starting initially with graphics chips used in video games, the company is now involved in making chips for AI applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robots.¬†

Last week, Citi strategists estimated that ChatGPT's growth could result in sales of $3 billion to $11 billion for Nvidia over the course of a year, per Bloomberg.¬†

The latest Markit PMI for the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to above the 50 mark in April, and rose to 53.7 in April, with the services PMI rising instead of falling to new highs since October last year and April last year, respectively. Strong demand supported a general expansion in business activity in the US manufacturing and services sectors in April, but also revived inflation that had cooled earlier in the year. Chris Williamson, an economist at S&P Global, commented that the upturn in demand was also accompanied by renewed price pressures, with CPI likely to rise, or at least remain somewhat elevated.

**Money is flooding into US stock ETFs as Wall Street issues back-to-back warnings**

A number of Wall Street investment banks have recently issued warnings that the rally in US stocks is doomed to fail and a crash is imminent, but investors seem to be choosing to ignore this. In April alone, more than US$12.6 billion flowed into US traded index funds (ETF), the largest inflow since January, with US$5.2 billion flowing in February and US$3.1 billion in March.

**Moody's downgrades 11 banks after another outflow of US bank deposits**

Seasonally adjusted data released by the Federal Reserve on Friday showed that US bank deposits fell by US$76.2 billion to US$17.2 trillion in the week ended April 12, compared with US$17.3 trillion in the previous week. Outflows were mainly seen at large banks and foreign institutions, but deposits at smaller banks also recorded a decline. On the same day, ratings agency Moody's downgraded 11 regional banks, including U.S. Hopewell, Bank of Hawaii, Zions, Western Alliance and First Republic Bank.

**At least nine lawmakers sell bank shares amid US banking turmoil**

Last month, the US banking crisis triggered turmoil in the financial markets. According to media reports, at least nine members of the US Congress sold off bank stocks before and during the market turmoil in March. According to the reports, New Jersey Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer disclosed that he sold $1,000-$15,000 worth of Silicon Valley Bank shares on 9 March. The day after his sale (March 10), Silicon Valley Bank was declared to have collapsed and taken over by the FDIC, triggering a massive plunge in US bank stocks.

**Google merges AI chip team into cloud computing unit to catch up with Microsoft and Amazon**

$Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://GOOGL.US))$ has reportedly shifted its team dedicated to AI chip development to its cloud division. It is reported that Google is making this adjustment mainly because it wants to enhance the competitiveness of its cloud computing team to catch up with its strong rivals Amazon Cloud and Microsoft Cloud. Google will integrate its two AI R&D labs, DeepMind and Google Brain, to strengthen the company's AI division.

**Tesla's market capitalisation slashes in a year as Musk is denounced by a coalition of shareholders**

On Friday, EST, 17 institutional shareholders of Tesla joined together to issue an open letter to the $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://TSLA.US))$ board, saying that CEO Musk is distracted by other companies and must be reined in. The investors pointed out that Tesla's market capitalisation has shrunk badly over the past year, with its current market capitalisation being only half of its $1.2 trillion market capitalisation on April 4 last year. And what upsets Tesla's shareholders most is that Musk is distracted too much from the operations of other companies. The 17 institutional shareholders together hold more than $1.5 billion worth of Tesla stock.

**Lyft plans job cuts that could affect 30% of its workforce**

Ride-hailing company $Lyft Inc ([LYFT.US](https://LYFT.US))$ plans to implement a new round of job cuts, eliminating 1,200 or more positions. This round of layoffs could affect 30% or more of the company's workforce, which numbers more than 4,000 employees. The company plans to announce the move after next week's board meeting.

**The key financial events and data for this week (4.24-4.28) are as follows:**

*In terms of economic data, the US will release the core PCE price index for March, the preliminary annualised quarterly rate of US real GDP for the first quarter and the US initial jobless claims for the week to April 22, among other heavyweight data coming out.*

*The earnings season is culminating with a number of heavyweight earnings reports coming in. In the US, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and Intel are set to announce their earnings reports. The report card of technology stocks is crucial for the whole market, as the 7 percentage point gain of the S&P 500 in the first quarter was mainly driven by a handful of technology giants*

**On the basis of the above data, I personally believe that the focus this week is on the earnings report and plan based on the performance of the earnings report**"
74,Microsoft Announces ChatGPT-4 release next week ($MSFT),14,11nuu67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11nuu67/microsoft_announces_chatgpt4_release_next_week/,6,1678468348.0," The website ""interestingengineering.com"" published an article on ChatGPT-4 on July 23, 2021, where it speculated on potential improvements and capabilities of the model. Some of these improvements could include enhanced natural language processing, better creativity, and problem-solving abilities, as well as increased personalization and improved multi-lingual capabilities.

The exact details and specifications of ChatGPT-4 are unknown as it is still in the development phase, and the model's release date remains unannounced. However, it is expected to build on the capabilities of its predecessor, ChatGPT-3, which is known for its ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, and even create music and artwork.

Overall, ChatGPT-4 has the potential to further advance the field of artificial intelligence and open up new possibilities for natural language processing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT-4 will likely be an even more advanced version of me, ChatGPT-3, with improvements in performance and capabilities. Here are some potential things ChatGPT-4 might be able to do:

1. Improved language processing: ChatGPT-4 could be better at understanding and processing human language than its predecessors. It may be able to understand more complex sentence structures, nuances of language, and contextual cues.
2. Enhanced creativity: ChatGPT-4 might be capable of generating more creative and original content, such as music, art, and poetry.
3. Better problem-solving: With increased computing power, ChatGPT-4 could be more adept at solving complex problems, such as mathematical equations, scientific hypotheses, or even philosophical debates.
4. Increased personalization: ChatGPT-4 may be able to personalize its responses to individual users based on their past interactions, preferences, and behaviors.
5. Improved multi-lingual capabilities: ChatGPT-4 could be better at translating between different languages, allowing for more seamless communication between people who speak different languages.

Of course, these are just some possibilities for what ChatGPT-4 might be capable of. The exact capabilities of the model will depend on the advances in AI technology and the specific design and training of the model.

Firstly, MSFT is investing heavily in AI and machine learning, and ChatGPT-4 could be a significant advancement in these fields. By improving the model's language processing, personalization, and problem-solving abilities, Microsoft could use ChatGPT-4 to develop new products and services that could enhance their existing offerings or create entirely new revenue streams.

Secondly, MSFT is a major player in the cloud computing industry, and AI models like ChatGPT-4 require significant computing resources to train and operate. By developing more advanced AI models, Microsoft could attract more customers to their cloud computing services, which could result in increased revenue for the company.

Thirdly, AI models like ChatGPT-4 are trained on vast amounts of data, and Microsoft has access to significant amounts of data from its products and services, such as Bing, Office 365, and LinkedIn. By using this data to train ChatGPT-4, Microsoft could potentially gain insights and improve its offerings further, giving them a competitive advantage over other companies.

Overall, ChatGPT-4 could benefit MSFT by enabling them to develop new products and services, attracting more customers to their cloud computing services, and gaining insights from their vast data sets.

**The Fed**

Initial jobless claim jumped to 245K much higher than expected and highest since Oct 2021. Initial claim claim increased slightly to 1.8MM.

However, from a historical perspective, total jobless claims currently represent only 1.24% of the entire labor force. Historical data shows that recessions typically begin when jobless claims at least 2% or more. Therefore, the current level of jobless claims is not yet a cause for concern. 

https://preview.redd.it/8618f1f10aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=030d4b5ae908fab1c3b1ec63eabbb29d7ff452f9

We will likely to see initial claims continue to climb in the coming months as historically rate hikes leads initial claims growth. Fed is not going to be concerned at this level and probably welcome a slightly loose jobs market.

COMERICA: ‚ÄúJobless claims show a small margin of slack is opening up in the labor market .. the direction for unemployment is very likely higher over the next six months .. The Fed is more likely to start cutting interest rates later this year than hold them unchanged into 2024.‚Äù

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released April data showing that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand rose by 0.2 percent, lower than the anticipated 0.3 percent. This follows a decline of 0.4 percent in March and no change in February. On a year-over-year basis, PPI increased by 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. The slowdown was primarily driven by a decrease in demand for energy (-8% YoY) and transportation & warehousing for goods (-5.1% YoY).

https://preview.redd.it/5jgtzc7z0aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63fe18131baf24a79431a482cd17fe46915873e7

Note that CPI is higher than PPI by 3%. Corporates are making good money on expanding margins. The inflation will last as long as people can still afford it.

More government spending coming than Fed can roll off their balance sheet. Bullish for stonks.

The consumer debt delinquency rate is increasing, although it remains below pre-pandemic levels. However, the rate is rising rapidly. Nothing to worry about now but definitely worth to keep an eye on.

**The Business**

Google has added over $100 billion to its market capitalization after unveiled new AI-centered features tied to Gmail and Workspace as its annual developers conference, Google I/O. 'AI' was mentioned over 140 times in its 2-hour Google I/O keynote. That's over 700 million dollars per ""AI"".

PacWest stock plunged 23% after it said it lost 9.5% of deposit last week. They actually reported no deposit losses on May 3rd but the stock selloff scared the depositors and they lost 9.5% in 2 days (May 4-5). Like I mentioned in the weekend post, there is no rational in fear. This kind of self-reinforcing deposit outflow will likely to continue from one bank to another.

However, banks today maintain significantly higher levels of liquidity compared to pre-pandemic times and even during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As long as there is no substantial decrease in the value of collateral assets  (like what happened to T-bills and office loans), the banking system remains fundamentally strong.

I added a couple of ""Small Growth"" stocks (with a strong cash balance and lower PS ratio than before the pandemic) to my portfolio today (ZS and DDOG). As I have mentioned a couple of times, I think these stocks can thrive in a slow growth low interest rate environment. My other positions have not changed.

# Stratasys and Desktop Metal to merge and flip Nano Dimension the bird

  
On May 25th, 2023, Stratasys and Desktop Metal announced a proposed **all-stock merger** that has been in the works for over a year *(as per remarks in the joint call)*. **Desktop Metal stockholders will receive 0.123 ordinary shares of Stratasys for each share of Desktop Metal** Class A common stock. The purchase consideration implies a **premium of 7.4%** to Desktop Metal's May 24th closing price of $1.75 to Stratasys's May 24th closing price of $14.88. Stratasys shareholders will own approximately 59% of the combined company, and Desktop Metal stockholders will hold about 41%. The combination will **strengthen the balance sheets**, provide even **greater synergies and cost reductions**, and the **complementary portfolio** of the two entities' solutions show little to no overlap - **creating the undisputed and largest industry** leader in the additive manufacturing space. Following on from **Stratasys's achievement of profitability** and **Desktop Metal's projection to reach adj.EBITDA breakeven in Q3 or Q4**, the joint entity forecasts **revenue of $1.1B by 2025**.   


Less than one hour after the announcement, **Nano Dimension announced** its fourth unsolicited tender offer in an **attempt to acquire Stratasys in a hostile takeover**. *‚ÄúAs we had previously indicated to the Stratasys Board, given their continued refusal to engage in negotiations, we have decided to present our offer directly to Stratasys‚Äô shareholders,‚Äù* [said Yoav Stern](https://investors.nano-di.com/press-releases/news-details/2023/Nano-Dimension-Launches-18.00-Per-Share-All-Cash-Special-Tender-Offer-to-Increase-Ownership-in-Stratasys-to-between-53-and-55-of-Its-Outstanding-Shares/default.aspx), Nano Dimension‚Äôs Chairman and CEO. Indeed, a quick glance at Nano's press releases, social media and conference calls reveals **a tirade of slander, misinformation and hostilities toward Stratasys**.  Unsurprisingly **this was met with a fourth rejection** from the board, [who cited](https://assets.website-files.com/646d3ff4f45630efe69682f1/6475f000bec55dc42ede16a4_Stratasys%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Unanimously%20Rejects%20Nano%20Dimension‚Äôs%20Partial%20Tender%20Offer.pdf) the **questionable legality, morality   and motives of Nano**. This comes at a time when **Nano Dimension is already in deep legal trouble with its investors**, namely Murchison. According to Murchinson, the meeting saw **92% of the votes cast supported Murchinson‚Äôs proposal to remove four directors from the Nano board, including Yoav Stern, Chief Executive Officer** and Chairman of Nano Dimension.

At the same time as this rejection, **Desktop Metal** [announced](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/151/desktop-metal-inc-adopts-limited-duration-shareholder) a **temporary poison pill** which expires either in mid-2024 or upon completion of the merger. Given that **Stratasys already has one** in place and there would be **no way for Nano to acquire Stratasys** without unsolicited shareholder offers *(which are extremely unlikely to succeed).*  Desktop Metal's temporary poison pill filing is therefore a safety measure to prevent Nano from enacting a hostile takeover or causing interference with the merger.   


**Despite** a significant amount of **cash and equivalents totalling over $1B** on hand and some pretty cool tech operating in a highly important market, **Nano Dimension's revenue has been a paltry $43.6M for FY2022**, and even that represents 316% growth and a 1,200% YoY. Sadly it seems that despite much interest over the last few years **Nano Dimension is ultimately a company with no viability and incredibly poor leadership** who have steered the company into the ground. Given that **Nano also have a poison pill, this unfortunately means they could not be acquired themselves** and therefore the writing is on the wall. 

# Draaaamaaaaa! So, what does this mean for the valuation? 

&#x200B;

Given the merger being all-stock, Desktop Metal shareholders will receive 0.123 Stratasys shares per 1 Desktop Metal share. Stratasys currently has 68.4M shares outstanding, and therefore this would create 39.53M new shares to create a grand total of 107.93M shares outstanding.   


In 2025 the joint entity forecasts revenue of $1.1B with a margin 10-12% (totalling $110M+ profit). Using the average multiple of 20x, this would place the valuation at **$2.2B by 2025 - equating to $20.37 per share**. The AM 2.0 industry is expected to grow to $100B by 2030 assuming a 25%CAGR, and the combined entity still expects to capture at least 10% market share. This would place revenue at $10B in 2030 and profit of $1B using the 10-12% margin given. The average forward multiple for a stock is 20-25x, placing the valuation at **$20B with the stock price at $185.12 in 2030 as a base case**. Given the unforeseen global events of the past three years, even implying a time-based discount of 30% (i.e, roughly three years behind schedule) still puts the shares price at roughly $130. Assuming both Desktop Metal and Stratasys continue to deliver on their promises, increase margins and capture a higher portion of the market by 2030, I predict that the **shares could be worth upwards of $555 assuming a 30% market share in the bull case**. 

Given the increasing demand for AM 2.0 solutions and backing by various national entities such as the [US Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/05/09/using-additive-manufacturing-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience-and-bolster-small-and-mid-size-firms/) during a time where supply times are being reevaluated and re-shored, I believe that the time for 3D printing to dominate is upon us. With existing customers as the two companies already have, it is not a matter of 'if' but 'when'. 

# What's the trade? 

  
Well, there's lots of ways to play this.   


Personally I am continuing to go long with my position in Desktop Metal on the basis that profitability is reached by the end of the year - regardless of the merger proposal. In my opinion, there is profound upside here should the deal go through or not. Average analyst estimate is currently $2.50 and the shares currently trade at $1.84 around significant support. I believe that should Desktop Metal announce profitability at some point in Q3 where the apex of the downtrend lies (August) there could be a significant and sustained pop in the stock up to around $5. Personally I feel that this is where the opportunity lies, and where the growth post-merger is overwhelmingly going to come from. I'd consider shares or LEAPs over short-term options to allow a margin of error.   


Due to ongoing hostilities with Nano Dimension I would be unlikely to consider opening a trade in Stratasys for  more than $8, particularly given inconsistencies in their profitability. I would prefer to wait and observe developments in these areas. Should Stratasys release consecutive positive quarters I would certainly reconsider my evaluations.   


Nano Dimension in my opinion could be an easy short when things inevitably deteriorate with Murchison and Yoav in court, but that's not a game I play.

Alphabet shares slid as much as 9% during regular trading with volumes nearly three times the 50-day moving average. They pared losses after hours and were roughly flat. The stock had lost 40% of its value last year but rallied 15% since the beginning of this year, excluding Wednesday's losses.

Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system. 

Google has been on its heels after OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. 

Google's live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated.

Bard's error was discovered just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California.

""While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo.""

It can answer your questions with near 100% accuracy, write essays, and give you lessons on entire topics? 

Chegg currently has roughly 2.3 billion dollars in assets and 1 billion dollars in liabilities. They have 5 million subscribers paying  $15+ a month for their services. This accounts for about 740 million in yearly revenue. They also have another revenue stream where they collect fees on textbooks they sell through the site. From the past three quarters this service has netted them just over 20 million dollars.  From these revenue streams they‚Äôve only made 11 million dollars as a company valued at 4 billion (they also paid off 500 million in debt this year). Lets say conservatively that 90% of their subscribers ditch the platform because of OpenAI. That means that if all expenses stay the same, Chegg will lose 64 million a month. They will go bankrupt in 15 months. I wonder what other stocks will be bankrupt thanks to OpenAI?

The stock market's momentum stalled after a dramatic rally, driven by the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence technologies, catapulted the market to its loftiest heights since August. Treasury yields dipped in anticipation of the U.S. Congress passing a resolution to avert a debt default.

The S&P 500 barely budged in trading, holding its ground just north of the 4,200 mark. With oil prices sliding below the $70 per barrel threshold, energy firms emerged as the drag on the index. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 continued its upward trajectory for the year, posting a robust 31% gain. Nvidia, a leader in the AI sector, hovered near the $1 trillion valuation mark following the unveiling of several AI-centric products. Blue-chip stocks such as Apple and Tesla also made notable strides, advancing over 1.5%.

On the bond front, U.S. yields retreated from their March peak as investors sized up the likely economic fallout from the recent agreement to temporarily lift the federal debt ceiling over the holiday weekend, along with an anticipated surge of month-end buying.

Treasury notes with maturities spanning 3 to 10 years were at the forefront of this downward trend. The two-year yield, typically more responsive to Federal Reserve policy changes projections than its longer-term counterparts, hovered around the 4.5% mark.

**SPY Emerges from Accumulation Phase, Enters Redistribution's First Stage: Bears Eye Tomorrow's Market for 2nd Redistribution Stage**

SPY drew buy-side interest at 420.89 and saw accumulation at the day's top. Following this, it shifted lower, erasing sell-side liquidity at 419.78 and 419.05, effectively completing the first redistribution phase. This could signal a new trend in SPY's market behavior.

# Understanding The Economic Vital Signs of Texas

Business indicators serve as the economy's vital signs. They provide a real-time glimpse into the health of a region's economy. A recent analysis of Texas' economy paints a mixed picture. While certain indicators such as production, capacity utilization, new orders, and the growth rate of orders are trending down, others are showing surprising resilience‚Äã.

**The Current State of Affairs**

A noticeable trend is the rise in finished goods inventories. This could suggest that Texas businesses are anticipating a surge in demand. Alternatively, it might be a signal that goods are not selling as quickly as expected, an indicator of a potential slowdown in consumer activity‚Äã.

At the same time, data shows a decrease in prices paid for raw materials, prices received for finished goods, and wages and benefits. This could imply tighter margins for businesses in the near future, which might put pressure on profitability‚Äã.

**Looking Forward**

Future projections provide mixed signals. Predictions point to increases in production, capacity utilization, shipments, and employment in the next six months. This could suggest a potential rebound in the economic activities of the region‚Äã.

However, the future might not be all rosy. Anticipated decreases in new orders, the growth rate of orders, unfilled orders, delivery time, finished goods inventories, prices paid for raw materials, hours worked, and capital expenditures could suggest challenging times ahead‚Äã.

A key point of concern is the projected decrease in capital expenditures (CapEx). If Texas businesses are less willing or able to invest in their future growth, it could have a significant impact on the state's long-term economic vitality‚Äã.

**Concluding Thoughts**

In conclusion, the business climate in Texas appears to be a mixed bag. While there are reasons for optimism, such as projected increases in production and employment, there are also reasons for concern. As always, a balanced and nuanced understanding of these indicators is necessary when making business decisions or forecasting economic trends‚Äã.

For those interested in a more detailed analysis of the state's manufacturing sector, the [Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tmos/2023/2305#tab-results) provides further insights. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the state's factory activity, which is a crucial component of Texas' economy.

# Catch the Market Pulse: Unraveling the Oscillations Between External and Internal Liquidity

The market moves from the external liquidity range to the internal liquidity range and back to the external liquidity range.

1. **External to Internal**: At the start of a trading period, the market may be at an extreme range where external liquidity is high. This could be a point where many stop orders (buy-side for downtrends, sell-side for uptrends) are placed. As these stop orders are hit, they generate trades that move the market away from the extreme towards the internal range.
2. **Internal Liquidity Phase**: Once the market moves into the internal range, trades occur within this range. During this phase, new buy & sell orders populate the range, and market maker buy & sell models form inside the range. This phase is characterized by liquidity voids and fair value gaps filling in.
3. **Internal to External**: After some time, the market might move towards the other extreme of the range, where the opposite type of stop orders (sell-side for downtrends, buy-side for uptrends) are placed, representing high external liquidity. The hitting of these stop orders then pushes the market back towards the internal range, and the cycle repeats.

*Here is an example of the ES based on today‚Äôs price action. Study the chart. Add the levels. Note how the market has moved into the internal liquidity phase after completing the external liquidity phase.*

# H1 Chart

SPY closed a candle below the change of character at 419.21 so now I‚Äôm looking for selling opportunities until we get below the 50% discount zone at 416.44. As noted in the recap, we swept a few sell-side liquidities and have a few more to check off, IMO. Could we bounce at the current level? Absolutely. Is it probable? No, in my opinion, because we are balanced at this level and have a few buy-side imbalances and sell-side inefficiency below the current level that the market may be looking to balance. I‚Äôve established that we are in a bull market and looking for a pullback.

\-----------------

On the H1 timeframe, we printed a bearish divergence this morning. I will now look for it to play out to at least the 30-line (oversold).

https://preview.redd.it/qhemyb67j33b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6efca4af155ae5afbdfa28bb440af8ed3a42fc7e

We are also near the top range of the bullish uptrend on the RSI. It does have room to run, but, to me, the H1 chart looks bearish to me, and it‚Äôs unlikely that we will form a new high tomorrow

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.

## üé© Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Have a Magical Flavor ‚ú®

Darlings, let me tell you about the mystical world of technical analysis and indicator-based trading. They're like fortune tellers, using the past to predict the future! üîÆ

Now, our magical analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that, we can calculate portfolio-level greeks‚ÄîDelta and Gamma being the stars of the show. üåü Once we have those, we can simulate changes in greeks at different price points. This is where the real magic happens! ‚ú®

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or sometimes both. It's the reaction from these price levels in the past that drives our trading signals. üìà

Now, our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which reflects the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock, and the best plays benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV. üéØ

## üìú Notes - A Wrinkle in Time

If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious, my dear. Something has changed since these plays were generated. Remember to sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest at your discretion. Risk up to 1% of your total capital on any trades you take, or less if your conviction is lower. And keep in mind that the trades were calculated before market open, so new price movement may invalidate the original thesis. üå™Ô∏è

## ü¶â FAQ - Wisdom from Madame Zeroni

* Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? üêª No, darling. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays? üé≠ No, my child. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn. üöÄ
* What about new plays on the same ticker? üîÑ The new play should replace the old play, as the old play is likely now invalid.
* Where are the crayons? üñçÔ∏è Click the links above, sweetie.
* Have you back-tested this? üß™ Yes, with a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error).
* What is the historical performance? üìö Realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) üìä

Now go forth, my darlings, and may the magic of the market be with you! üîÆ‚ú®"

**The Economy**

Germany officially entered a recession in Q1 2023, as the GDP was revised lower to -0.3%, following a 0.5% decline in Q4 2022. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Interestingly, despite the recession, the DAX reached an all-time high last week.

The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index is currently at its highest level in over a year. This indicates that economic data releases have been surpassing market expectations. As a result, the expectation of a recession keeps getting pushed back.

So many diverging signals this year. Here is another one: 10-year yield suggests booming growth, while the copper/gold ratio indicates a potential recession.

JPM, says stocks' risk-reward is 'poor,' recommends adding to cash and gold holdings.

BoA: ‚ÄúWhile a potential recession in 2H (house view) could put some pressure on the consensus 2H earnings recovery, we believe the downside risk will be mitigated given companies‚Äô cost cuts. ..

This AI frenzy reminds me of the ""cloud"" trend from 2015 to 2018, and even 2019 before the COVID crash. The ""cloud kings"" (if anyone still remembers) experienced significant returns due to the real growth in cloud services and the widespread adoption of cloud technology. AI may very well be the next big thing. However, the risk is real too, as it could follow a similar path to the overheated dot com bubble or the underwhelming performance of the AR/VR Multiverse. Valuation aside, I am inclined to believe AI is here to stay and the potential is huge, as it is being adopted very broadly very quickly across various industries. What do you think?"

88,"Nvidia released a new ""nuclear bomb"", Google chatbot is also coming, computing power stocks again on the tide of halt",8,11y6xs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11y6xs5/nvidia_released_a_new_nuclear_bomb_google_chatbot/,14,1679459469.0,"On March 21, arithmetic stocks (data centers, AI chips, CPO, etc.) were again sharply stronger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In news, overnight Nvidia released a dedicated GPU for ChatGPT, claiming to increase inference speed by 10x.

&#x200B;

Also in recent days, ChatGPT users around the world have been finding error warnings popping up on the site due to a large increase in access, and even privileged Plus accounts have not been spared.

&#x200B;

The latest research report of Anxin Securities has made an inference on GPT-4 arithmetic power demand: GPT-4 has increased its inferred arithmetic power demand to more than ten times due to the increase in complexity and the addition of image recognition function.

&#x200B;

NVIDIA Releases ChatGPT Dedicated GPU, Increases Inference Speed by 10 Times

&#x200B;

On March 21, Beijing time, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced the inference GPU (graphics processor) H100 NVL designed for ChatGPT at the 2023 GTC developer conference, which stitches together two of Nvidia's H100 GPUs to deploy large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, according to Punch News.

&#x200B;

The only current GPU that can actually handle ChatGPT is the NVIDIA HGX A100, and compared to the former A100, a standard server with four pairs of H100s and dual NVLINKs can now be 10 times faster, reducing the cost of processing large language models by an order of magnitude, said Jen-Hsun Huang.

&#x200B;

In addition to custom chips, NVIDIA also released cuLitho, a breakthrough lithography computational library. NVIDIA announced that after years of collaboration with TSMC, ASML, Synopsys and other companies, it has launched a new computational lithography application that greatly reduces the time and energy consumed by chip foundries in this process, ready for the arrival of 2nm and more advanced processes.

&#x200B;

In addition, NVIDIA has launched DGX Cloud, an AI supercomputing service, NVIDIA AI Foundations, a cloud service that accelerates enterprises to create big models and generative AI, and the world's first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system in partnership with Quantum Machines.

&#x200B;

Jen-Hsun Huang said that the AI industry is in an ""iPhone moment"" - startups are racing to build disruptive business models, and industry giants are looking for ways to respond, and are making bold statements - ""NVIDIA is about AI. -Nvidia is to be the TSMC of AI!

&#x200B;

On the domestic front, Jen-Hsun Huang said that in China, it has special customized Ampere and Hopper chips, these will be provided through Chinese cloud providers, such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, these companies to provide the ability to land, fully believe that they have the ability to provide top-notch system services, for Chinese startups will certainly have the opportunity to develop their own large language models.

&#x200B;

Google chatbots are also coming, AI big models lead the arithmetic layer for long-term benefits

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, March 21, US time, US tech giant Google Inc. launched a beta version of its AI chatbot Bard in a bid to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

&#x200B;

Bard, which will run separately from its Google search engine, currently generates answers in English only and currently offers access to users on a waitlist on a first-come, first-served basis. Google says over time, Bard will be adapted to more languages as well as rolled out to more regions.

&#x200B;

Axiom Securities pointed out that ChatGPT, GPT4.0, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Wenxin Yiyin and Google Bird were released one after another, and the AI big model represented by ChatGPT and its initial application ""stirred up a thousand layers of waves"".

&#x200B;

It said that with the release of multimodal large model GPT-4, the pace of applications based on text, pictures and other vertical scenarios is expected to accelerate from 1 to 10, similar to the blossoming of various types of APPs in the mobile Internet era, and the competition pattern will gradually intensify. And analogous to the late 19th century ""gold rush"" in the western United States, a large demand for shovels, jeans, it believes that the GPGPU as the representative of the arithmetic infrastructure as a large model of AI base will benefit long-term stability.

&#x200B;

GPT4 arithmetic power demand increased to more than ten times

&#x200B;

The latest research report of Anxin Securities made an inference on GPT-4 arithmetic demand and future trends: GPT-4's speculative arithmetic demand increased to more than ten times due to the increase of complexity and the addition of picture recognition function.

&#x200B;

It said that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pointed out in a public interview that GTP-4 has 20 times more parameters than GTP-3 and requires 10 times more computation than GTP-3; GTP-5 is released at the end of 2024 to 2025, which has 100 times more parameters than GTP-3 and requires 200-400 times more computation than GTP-3.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The bottleneck of arithmetic power is not in the absolute size of the arithmetic power, but in the cost of achieving that arithmetic power. From the perspective of cost, Guoxin Securities has also made a calculation on this, which according to the public data of GPT-4, the cost of asking a question per 1000 tokens is $0.03 and the cost of completing an answer per 1000 tokens is $0.06 under the context length of 8K; under the context length of 32K context length, the question cost per 1000 tokens is $0.06, and the answer completion cost per 1000 tokens is $0.12.

&#x200B;

It says that this arithmetic cost rises higher (50%-200% increase in input cost and 200%-500% increase in output cost) compared to the cost of GPT-3 (about $0.02 per 1000 tokens), and is even more significant compared to the cost of GPT-3.5-turbo, with a 14-29 times increase in input cost and a 29-59 times increase in output cost. The increase is 29-59 times.

&#x200B;

In addition, the expansion of the AI server market has simultaneously driven up the demand for high-speed NICs, HBM, DRAM, NAND, PCBs, etc. At the same time, the technology around the solution of GPU ""power wall, memory wall"" in the large computing power scenario continues to upgrade, such as storage and computing integration, silicon light / CPO industrialization process is expected to speed up; advanced process chip evolution in the existing Chiplet and other technical paths will also benefit; Risk-V due to open source and free, developer freedom, high degree of autonomy, high control, and the risk of the development of the chip. The advantages of Risk-V, such as free open source, high developer freedom, high degree of independent control, and more adaptable to AIoT processor architecture requirements, will drive the number of participating companies around AI scenarios."

**Market Price Action and General Outlook**:

In  recent  market activity, distribution has become more evident, with  investors  seeking safety in large technology stocks. However, this is  not  indicative of a healthy market. The MACD on the weekly chart  continues  to decline, suggesting that the SPY may drop while large tech  stocks  continue to rise. Recent market trends have been influenced by  key events such  as Fed speakers' assurances that it's too early to  consider rate cuts or  pauses, and the approaching X-date on the Federal  debt ceiling. The GDP  growth has been slowing, moving from 12.46% in  Q2 of 2021 to just 1.56%  in the last quarter, with more deceleration  expected, indicating an  emerging earnings recession. The market's  reliance on mega tech raises  questions about how long the market can  continue to deteriorate without  an apparent overall decline.

**Market Gex and Gamma Distribution**:

The  market has shown  remarkable stability despite a decline and a modest  increase in the  VIX, with short-dated equity vol retreating. Dealer  gamma remains close,  making it challenging for the market to move below  4000 or above 4200.  The market experienced a weaker sentiment, with  credit spreads and high  yield spreads rising. The Nasdaq reached YTD  highs, while small caps  experienced a momentary bullishness that  quickly reversed. The S&P  500's breadth models indicated a  disproportionate weakness, with only  28% of the index trading above  their respective 20-day moving averages.

**MSI Indicator**:

The  recent MSI and VIX signals show a  mixed market sentiment. In the last  few days, the MSI has been declining  from a high of 2.01 on 2023-05-05  to 0.69 on 2023-05-16, indicating a  shift from strong positive  sentiment to a more neutral sentiment. The  VIX has been oscillating in a  range of 15.78 to 20.09, which is  moderately high, suggesting a degree  of uncertainty and volatility in  the market. As the MSI approaches  zero, the market is becoming more  sensitive to sudden changes  influenced by the VIX. Traders should  exercise caution in this market  environment. Those with long positions  may consider adding hedges to  protect their investments, while others  should keep a close eye on the  MSI and VIX to identify potential market  trends and adjust their  strategies accordingly.

Given the current market sentiment, here are some potential scenarios for SPY on 5/18/2023:

1. **Bullish Scenario**:  If the market continues to show resilience as it has in recent days, we  could see a continuation of the upward trend. This could be further  supported if there's positive news from the meeting between McCarthy and  Biden regarding the debt ceiling agreement. In this case, SPY could  potentially move towards the flipping point at a strike of 417.1, as  indicated by the GEX analysis.
2. **Bearish Scenario**:  If the market reacts negatively to the declining MACD on the weekly  chart and the slowing GDP growth, we could see a downward movement in  SPY. This could be exacerbated if there's no agreement on the debt  ceiling, leading to a potential market sell-off.
3. **Neutral Scenario**:  Given the mixed market sentiment indicated by the MSI and VIX signals,  the market could also remain relatively stable, with SPY oscillating  around its current levels.

92,roku thesis for friend,8,14ep6g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ep6g4/roku_thesis_for_friend/,10,1687299546.0,"Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.

In terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.

In the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is ""Hold"". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.

Considering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:

**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.

**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.

**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.

**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.

**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.

**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.

**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.

**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.

**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is ""Hold"", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.

However, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.

An addendum that incorporates some extra key points:

**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.

**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.

**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.

**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.

**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.

In summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.

93,Trading Themes for Q4,9,12dpuzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12dpuzx/trading_themes_for_q4/,12,1680799058.0,"# Bearish:

**Oil:** OPEC cuts + China reopening + summer demand. This is inflationary and will impact all inflation inputs with the greatest impact being on the more volatile food and energy. Oil going up means higher for longer will be even higher and even longer. If somehow we avoid a recession, the price is going up as prices are somewhat muted currently over fears of a slowdown. Bearish for the market, bullish for oil stocks and dividends. VOC, DVN, ET, BTU - stocks like these are probably the best places to hide in the most bearish of economic outcomes. Someday the US needs to refill, a floor has been established at their price point.

**Rates and QT:** Central banks all have been and are committed to new rake hikes. Higher for longer is the global theme. Remember when Powell said it was transitory and did nothing for six months? He was late to pivot hawkish. He will be late to pivot dovish. It‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs going to kill inflation or get fired trying. ‚ÄúThe effects of stopping too soon are greater than stopping too late.‚Äù Short profitless growth with puts as most should retrace at least some or all of their 2023 gains.

**Banks** are seeing record withdrawals, please learn to read and understand the charts correctly. Less money in banks means less loans, less projects, tighter lending criteria. Less liquidity, more realized losses. The biggest shorts in the markets are banks - they are dead in the water, with a limited time one year get out of jail free card from the fed. Hundreds of reputable banks would implode if that facility was removed, and the only way they survive is if the facility is extended or rates get cut drastically. Short the sector ETFs - not sure buying puts here would work out given the IV and elevated premiums.

**Commercial Real Estate** could be the next economic issue to have a material impact on stocks being in essentially the same situation as the banks. REITs are getting withdrawal requests and putting pressure on selling assets to fulfill them. Debt positions must be closed, and refinancing is not attractive. Compounding this is the pandemic likely had a permanent negative impact on the price/value of commercial/office space globally. The debt tied to these assets must be unwound and this means more realized losses. Blackrock, the same entity WSB complains about buying up residential housing, is now halting withdrawals and unwinding things by a de facto margin call from its customers. If you want to be short real estate, you have to look for commercial specific trades as residential real estate is not facing this debt burden or supply/demand problem.

**Unemployment** cracks are starting to form. The data from q1 showed firms drastically slowed hiring by virtue of less job openings- this is the other side of the labor market, the open positions. If the trend continues, this means salaries stop being bid up, more people struggle to find new jobs. Less employed, chasing less salaries, means less liquidity/savings/bank deposits/stock purchases. Puts on profitless growth (selling calls would have higher expected value). Powell is requesting a 1 percent rise in unemployment, be bearish until he gets it.

**Earnings** are an unknown but when reviewing leading indicators weaker earnings are widely expected. A slowing consumer, rising interest costs, means less earnings at the bottom line. The PE ratios of many companies are disconnected from ‚Äúreality‚Äù and the SP is overvalued historically.

**Geopolitical** environment is terrible and getting worse in terms of conflict. US political and social climate is getting worse in terms of conflict.

**All of the above is recessionary** and aligns with historical precedence of the capitalist boom-bust economic cycle.

# Neutral:

**This is a controlled demolition** \- the fed, the us, the eu, the oil cartels, the Chinese do not want a financial crisis nor do they want hyper inflation. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù will do anything to avoid a total ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù and have magic fiscal and monetary policies to extend the problems into the future or make the tax paying population slightly more poor.

**Stagflation** is a very real potential outcome for the economy and for stocks performance. If the financial engineering works, but the asset bubble(s) pop financial assets will go sideways - like Japan. Instead of paying in dollars, we pay in time.

# Bullish:

**The new fed facility** saved the banks. This is not the same money printer or QE, but the net effect lowered 2 year yields and supported tech stocks. There is more room on this facility.

**The new 40 year mortgage.** This simply makes getting debt financing easier. More liquidity, some level of easing is applied specifically to the housing market. This is inflationary however and will only bid up residential housing demand further.

**Financial engineering**. As the reserve currency, politicians and the fed can engineer their way out of almost any problem. New banking facility, changing rates, QE, 40 year mortgages, tax credits, student loan forgiveness, UBI, and anything else they can come up with that we haven‚Äôt yet imagined.

**AI** is going to going to be disruptive, but if there was any time to use the excuse of ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù it is on the AI trend. If you haven‚Äôt spent 30 minutes interfacing with chatgpt you are likely missing a technological leap the scale of the computer, the internet, the mobile phone. Even if you don‚Äôt want to invest in the trend, invest in your understanding of chatgpt for your own skillset if you want to win. Calls and shares at ‚Äúthe bottom‚Äù on a basket of the best names in AI: MSFT, NVDA, GOOG and some small/mid cap stocks.

**The USD** won‚Äôt be replaced anytime soon certainly not in this economic cycle - the US and our military would essentially need to ‚Äúdefault on its obligations‚Äù before the globe would stop investing in USD in favor of something else. No other country or group of countries is remotely as stable, trustworthy, powerful as the US. However the strength of the contender may continue to grow - watch Ray Dalio video on YouTube which explains this.

**Everyone is bearish** and professional sentiment is low, but stocks only go up. This is the BTFD generation, and the most average humans I know still have money to throw at assets. Institutional investors are positioned bearish, and sitting on high proportions of cash waiting to be deployed. The party is not over just yet.

Wedbush‚Äôs Daniel Ives‚Äô comments ahead of the much-talked-about bot‚Äôs anticipated entrance into the Microsoft ecosystem.

‚ÄúThis OpenAI investment/strategic partnership which is likely in the $10 billion range is a game changer in our opinion for Nadella & Co. as the ChatGPT bot is one of the most innovative AI technologies in the world today,‚Äù the 5-star analyst said.

There is a public company called Genius Sports (GENI) who owns the video version of Chat GPT through their Second Spectrum acquisition. They currently create new and actionable data from live sports broadcasting. The data has use in their sports betting business as well as enabling teams to use the data to create insight for better team performance. Their technology can be used across all video to create actionable insight beyond just sports. They are the Chat GPT of video! Stock currently has $1B valuation that is based solely on the growth of data they provide to sports betting companies to run their business. OpenAI is expected to do $200M in total revenue for 2023, Second Spectrum will do $25M in revenue. Why isn't Second Spectrum worth $3.6B based on Chat GPT's recent valuation for the video version of Chat GPT? Would add about $16 per share to the current $4.80 share price of $GENI.

Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**

**If  you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, IBM‚Äôs been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with ‚Äúdisrupters‚Äù like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM‚Äôs MAIN FOCUS!**

**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy‚Äôs on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend‚Äôs weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**

**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin‚Äôs boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**

**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**

**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**

**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend‚Äôs tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**"
100,ChatGPT 4 and MSFT - Bulls Get Ready,2,11ps35y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ps35y/chatgpt_4_and_msft_bulls_get_ready/,8,1678660397.0,"GPT-4 is a new and improved language model that is being developed by a company called OpenAI. This model is expected to be much better than its predecessor, GPT-3. The launch date for GPT-4 has not been suspected to start next week, and people are excited about the new capabilities that it might have.

GPT-4 is expected to be better at understanding and processing natural language, which means it might be able to answer more complex questions and generate more accurate responses. It could also have the ability to create videos from text, which would be a big step forward in the field of AI.

Microsoft is reportedly working with OpenAI to develop GPT-4, and this partnership could benefit both companies. For example, Microsoft might be able to use GPT-4 to improve its chatbots and virtual assistants, which could make them more helpful and engaging for users. Microsoft might also be able to use GPT-4 to automate the video production process, which could save time and effort.

Overall, GPT-4 could be a big step forward for the field of AI, and Microsoft's collaboration with OpenAI could help it stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field."
101,A Quantum Leap In AI: IonQ Aims To Create Quantum Machine Learning Models At The Level Of General Human Intelligence,2,13z5ltm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13z5ltm/a_quantum_leap_in_ai_ionq_aims_to_create_quantum/,31,1685779877.0,"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.

In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.

Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).

**Bread and Butter Stocks:**

1. **NVDA -**   No questions asked here right. Haha just kidding. This company is by   far one of the best buys that one could possibly pull off for a good   long term investment ranging anywhere from 1-3 years or if you have more   time try 5-10 years. This chip manufacturer not only produces the best   chips but they produce the most chips found in traditional technology   (CPU's, GPU's, Phones, Tablets, \*Vehicles). What makes these chips   special is their functionality in which how they can have AI like   tendencies found within the code of their chip. These tendencies so to   say are a back bone to the future move of what AI has to update to to   help overall human society as living conditions will only get harsher as   the years come inevitably. \*Note: Maybe not so much vehicles as this   next company has their leavings all over this are of the industry.
2. **TSLA -**   Saw this one coming huh. Without a doubt I have heard the word 'Tesla'   at least every week since it tanked down in prices. They have a unique   like property compared to any other vehicle manufacturer on the  market.  That is the fact that they have all of their vehicles equipped  with the  best chip and code for the most efficient and optimal way of  Autonomous  driving. Now if one wants to play a game of connect the dots  one will  realize that both of these companies can be categorized as  companies  that possess AI like features. This is where things get fun  and where I  plan on calling some long shots for the future ahead and  due to recent  sensations on the internet.

The following section is based off the recent sensation of the AI program known as ChatGPT. This then lead me to a deep dive into the world of companies on the frontiers of AI development.

**Bullish Stocks:**

1. **BBAI -**   Big Bear.ai Holdings Inc is a company responsible for collecting data   information, compiling it to something meaningful, and relaying it back   to other bigger companies to target consumers more accurately. I heard   about this company by doing a search on who made ChatGPT and that  turned  out to be Open AI. They are not public on the stock market they  are a  private company.  The next thing associated to Open AI was Big  Bear and  man do their 5D 1M and 6M returns look promising.
2. **AI (C3.AI)** **-**   Came across this company after figuring out who else were some major   role players in the AI industry sector. Turns out C3.AI is a company who is all about the advancement of machine learning and AI which is very huge for human population future problems. One would be a fool not to invest in this now official categorized Bull stock.

**3. PLTR -**   Palantir Technologies is a company that focuses on the AI development of space craft like vehicles. They also have some projects within the government and cybersecurity sector. This one is another no brainer."

Buckle up because this DD will reveal why Google is trembling in the face of OpenAI, losing top talent, and dealing with Bard's epic failure.

&#x200B;

ü§ñ Bard, the Failing Chatbot ü§ñ

First, let's talk about Bard, Google's chatbot. It's become clear that nobody is adopting this disaster of an AI, and it has consistently failed in every public demonstration. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and the internet is feasting on the carnage.

In contrast **ChatGPT, barely in it's early infancy, is already the fastest growing internet application in the history of humanity** ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/))

&#x200B;

üî• Desperation & Controversy üî•

Just a few hours ago, The Verge published an article ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies)) detailing some damning allegations. The Information reported that a former Google AI researcher accused the company of using ChatGPT data (a rival's responses) to train Bard. Google denies it, but when asked directly, Bard fessed up ([https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20](https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20)).

The plot thickens. Jacob Devlin, a Google AI engineer, warned the company not to use ChatGPT data because it would violate OpenAI's terms of service and make Bard's answers look suspiciously similar. Google supposedly stopped using the data after his warnings, but who can trust them at this point?

Devlin then jumped ship, leaving Google to join OpenAI immediately. That's right, folks ‚Äì we're seeing top talent abandon Google in droves, and it's only the beginning.

&#x200B;

üëÄ Why is this big? ü§î

**It's illegal for Google to use ChatGPT's data to train their AI**. There might be a lawsuit coming their way soon. If **OpenAI can get an injunction on Google Bard or any other of their AI technologies** based on this engineer's testimony, it's be game over for Google.

Careful though, I wouldn't bet on OpenAI either. Any company that tries to be ""the owner of AI"" is doomed to fail. AI is quickly becoming an open technology.

People are already running AI almost as powerful as GPT directly on their phones with open models ([https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20)). Also on their computers ([https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71](https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71)).

New, faster, better, more portable models are coming out every day (this came out just a few days and its 100x faster to train than GPT: [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)). Additionally, most of the innovation is coming out of small groups, independent researchers and tech enthusiasts at home. It's like the early days of home computing all over again.

&#x200B;

üö® Panic in Google-land üö®

Rumors are swirling that Google employees are calling for Sundar Pichai to be replaced ASAP. The company is in full-blown panic mode, and their desperation is becoming more apparent with each passing day ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1))

A lot of the leadership of the most innovative programs are leaving Google ([https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3)). Like the head of VR who left to start his own AI company ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor))

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Google is on the ropes, and Bard's failures are just the tip of the iceberg. They're losing top talent to OpenAI, facing damning allegations, and their once-untouchable reputation is crumbling. The market will eventually catch up to these realities, and it's time for us to keep our eyes on the prize.

Legends have been made in the form of 27k loan guy, watermelon guy, $2M YOLO guy, and even the unsung heroes who dutifully went in at open yesterday when everyone thought it would bleed to $5, like the miners trudging in to clean up Chernobyl while it was still in a meltdown.

But my question is this: How high would BBBY have gone without RC's filings and sales?

As I see it, there are different levels of awareness of squeezes.

1 - Squeezes that are like trees in the forest that nobody sees fall.

2 - Squeezes that gain traction on Reddit and Stocktwits

3 - Squeezes that make it on to financial TV or financial publications 

4 - Squeezes that go fully mainstream

In the last category I can only really think of GME, AMC, and Elon Musk-pumped shitcoins.

BBBY was going smoothly through the gears and reached cat.4 with the AI created ginger hedge fund guy YOLOing 25m of god knows whose money and making a massive profit. But by the time that happened, the damage had already been done.

Considering the mainstream awareness, that insane gamma ramp, the shorts refusing to back down, RC as the figurehead inspiring irrationally positive sentiment, the risk-on market mood, I'd say had RC not sold, BBBY would've gone to $40 EoW, and probably peaked at $100 in the next few weeks. 


TLDR: THAT WAS AN INTERESTING WEEK. LOTS OF SQUEEZES WANT TO BE THE NEXT GME, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE. THIS ONE FELT LIKE IT MIGHT BE THOUGH. HOW HIGH WOULD BBBY HAVE GONE HAD COHEN NOT SOLD?"
106,Why hasn't META taken advantage of the AI trend?,0,1162spp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1162spp/why_hasnt_meta_taken_advantage_of_the_ai_trend/,43,1676785408.0,"I'm curious as to why Meta hasn't taken any steps to ride the hot-wave of AI and the AI war going on between MSFT and GOOG. As far as I'm aware, isn't Meta similarly positioned in terms of R&D and AI technology? Are they purposely keeping it under wraps for whatever reason? If they disclosed they were also going to launch some kind of AI software to the public, I feel like a lot of people would realize how well-positioned they are in the field of AI, rather than being focused only on the metaverse, which has been a contentious topic for most. But I think AI on the other hand would fare quite well considering how people are crazed over it currently.

I sent this post as a prompt into ChatGPT, and this was its answer...

*Meta, formerly Facebook, has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years. In fact, many of the most innovative and high-profile AI applications have been developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), which is the company's dedicated AI research division. Some of FAIR's key contributions to the field of AI include advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, among others.*

*However, Meta's strategy and priorities as a company are not solely focused on AI. While AI is certainly an important part of their technological arsenal, they have also been investing heavily in other areas such as virtual and augmented reality, as well as the Metaverse, which they see as the next major computing platform.*

*In terms of Meta's approach to disclosing their AI capabilities, it is worth noting that many of the most significant advances in AI are often kept under wraps until they are ready for commercial deployment. This is because the field of AI is highly competitive, and companies are often trying to gain a strategic advantage over their competitors. Additionally, there are also concerns around the potential ethical implications of AI, which may lead companies to be cautious about how they disclose their research.*

*Overall, while Meta is certainly a major player in the field of AI, they are also pursuing a wide range of other technological innovations, and it is likely that their AI research will continue to play an important but relatively quiet role in their broader strategy.*

Furthermore, I asked it about specifics of their AI R&D and comparatively to their current competitive counterpart:

*Meta (formerly Facebook) has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years, and their efforts have resulted in a number of high-profile applications and contributions to the field of AI. Here are a few examples:*

1. *Computer Vision: Meta's computer vision research has led to the development of a number of innovative applications, including automatic image and video captioning, face recognition, and object detection. One particularly noteworthy contribution is the development of the DeepMask and SharpMask algorithms, which are used for high-quality object segmentation in images.*
2. *Natural Language Processing: Meta has made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) through its work on the Transformers architecture. Transformers is a deep learning model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis.*
3. *Reinforcement Learning: Meta has also made important contributions to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Their RL research has led to the development of advanced algorithms for game playing and other tasks.*

*These are just a few examples of the many areas in which Meta has made important contributions to AI research. In terms of how they compare to other major players in the field, here are a few thoughts:*

* *OpenAI: Like Meta, OpenAI is a major player in the field of AI research, and has made important contributions in a variety of areas. However, OpenAI's focus is somewhat different, as they are specifically dedicated to advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity. This has led them to focus on areas such as reinforcement learning and generative models, as well as research into the potential societal implications of AI.*
* *Microsoft: Microsoft is also heavily invested in AI research, and has made significant contributions in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One notable example is the development of the GPT series of language models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of NLP tasks.*
* *Google: Like Meta, Google has made important contributions to AI research in a wide range of areas. Some of their most notable contributions include the development of the TensorFlow machine learning framework, as well as advances in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.*

*Overall, all of these companies are major players in the field of AI research, and each brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table. Meta's research is notable for its focus on computer vision and NLP, as well as their work on the Metaverse and virtual reality.*

It would seem like just a matter of time before they announce something that directly or indirectly competes with Google and Microsoft too, maybe an avatar chatbot AI you can see in VR/AR? That would be pretty cool.

And from there you can quickly see where it would go. Immersive experiences with AI generated content:

I think one path of the AI and metaverse will be influencer and celebrity avatars powered by AI. Have you seen on Twitch, the AI streamers, which are based on the input of all of the footage and recorded videos of the streamer? It's fascinating what the implications are, but imagine you could meet your favorite Twitch streamer, or movie celebrity powered by AI in the metaverse.

In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.

You could become an avatar, in Avatar, or become Neo in the Matrix, lol.

Powered by Meta, of course."

But investors who are looking at the confluence of China's re-opening, the competition between Beijing and Washington, and the explosion of opportunity in AI might want to turn their attention to Baidu. The Chinese version of Google announced that their own AI chatbot, ERNIE, will launch in March, and shares jumped 12% on the news.

# All about ERNIE

It stands for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration and it's a large language model created by Baidu back in 2019. What sets it apart from other language models is its ability to integrate knowledge with massive amounts of data, making its understanding and generation skills next level.

It's evolved into a series of advanced big models that can handle all sorts of tasks, like language understanding, language generation, and even text-to-image generation.

The CTO, Haifeng Wang, was hyping up deep learning as the core of AI in a presentation earlier this year and how it's showing major potential. And the Chairwoman of Baidu's Tech Committee, Hua Wu, was saying how AI-generated content could revolutionize film production.

108,OpenAI's Business Strategy - What is their Eng Game?,0,11zkkqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11zkkqg/openais_business_strategy_what_is_their_eng_game/,8,1679578424.0,"OpenAI has exploded on the scene primarily due to the popularity of its chat GPT product. Let's take a second and look over their overall goals, their investments, some of the outcomes they're trying to achieve from their campaigns, and some of the projects they're currently focused on.

OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Reed Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Elon Musk, and others. Elon Musk resigned from the board in 2018, right before OpenAI started a second branch which is a capped for-profit. However, the organization started as a non-profit and created its capped for-profit to attract talent and additional investment from corporate entities like Microsoft.

As an organization, its mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) and AI systems that are generally smarter than humans benefit all of humanity. To that end, they commit to following principles around broadly distributing benefits. They've committed to using the influence they obtain over AGI deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all and to avoid enabling users of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power. They share that their primary fiduciary duty is to humanity and want to empower society to flourish in the universe maximally.

AGI can accelerate its progress and cause significant changes to happen suddenly, even if the transition starts slowly. They expect it to happen quickly in the final stages. Some people in the AI field think that the risks of AGI and successor systems are fictitious, and they share they'll generally be delighted if that turns out to be correct. Still, they're going to operate as if these risks are existential. In particular, they think it's vital that society agrees on a vast balance of how AI can be used, but individual users have a lot of discretion within those bounds. They believe in empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the inherent power of the diversity of ideas.

As mentioned, they have a non-profit that governs their overall operations for the good of humanity. They have bylaws that can override any for-profit interests, including letting them cancel their equity obligations to shareholders for safety concerns and helping them push the experiment on AGI. Their charter has a clause to assist other organizations and advanced safety instead of racing with them in the late stages of AGI development. It is a different way of competing vs. cooperating with other organizations to help them successfully iterate on AGI.

As they successfully create more powerful systems, they want to deploy them and gain experience operating them in the real world. They expect OpenAI to have a gradual transition that gives people, policymakers, and institutions time to understand what's happening, personally experience the benefits and downsides of the systems, and adapt our economy and put regulations in place. This will also allow society and AI to co-evolve and for people to collectively figure out what they want. At the same time, as stakes are relatively low, they believe that democratized access will also lead to more and better research, decentralized power, more benefits, and a broader set of people contributing to new ideas.

They also believe the best way to navigate AI deployment challenges successfully is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration. Their decisions require much more caution than society usually applies to new technologies and are more risk-averse than many users would like. Successfully transitioning to a world with superior intelligence is perhaps human history's most important, hopeful, and scary project. They don't expect the future to be an unqualified Utopia, but they want to maximize the good and minimize the bad and for AGI to be an amplifier for humanity. Because the upside of AGI is so significant, they do not believe it is possible or desirable for society to stop development forever. Instead, they feel that the community and the developers of AGI have to figure out how to get it right. Although they can't predict precisely what will happen, and of course, their current progress could hit a wall, they can articulate the principles they care about the most.

AGI has the potential to give everyone incredible new capabilities, and they can imagine a world where all users have access to help with almost any cognitive task, providing a significant force multiplier for human ingenuity and creativity. Because the upside of AGI is so substantial, they've also shared that they want to carefully bring it into existence with the world in a transitional and thoughtful manner rather than just a sudden one.

As we mentioned earlier about their non-profit governing the organization's overall operations, they do have a cap on returns for their for-profit that their shareholders can earn so that they aren't incentivized to attempt to capture value without bound and risk deploying something potentially catastrophically dangerous. And, of course, as a way to share benefits with society, they've attempted to structure in addition to these new areas in a way that aligns their incentives with a good outcome. 

Generally speaking, AI will lead to significant progress, and they want to promote it by putting models and APIs out there through open-source means. Although they have closed some access to their research, they still generally will try to provide as much information to the public as possible through their non-profit charter. On the other hand, AGI could also come with severe risks of misuse, accidents, and social and societal disruption. They will attempt to build safe and beneficial AGI directly but will also consider their mission fulfilled if their work aids in achieving this, to help others achieve this outcome.

Long-term safety being a paramount focus for the organization, they are committed to doing research that requires making AGI safe and driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI communities. They anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill their mission. Still, they will always diligently act and minimize conflicts of interest among their employees and stakeholders that could compromise overall benefits.

They feel that society will face important questions about what AI systems can do, how to obtain acceptance, combat bias, deal with job displacement, and more. At some point, the balance between the upsides and downsides of deployment, such as empowering malicious actors, creating social and economic disruption, and accelerating an unsafe race, could shift, significantly changing their plans around continuous deployment. Lastly, they hope for a global conversation about how to govern these systems, fairly distribute the benefits they generate, and fairly share access.

They are also developing steerable models to help build and iterate on the GPT product safely and consistently. Their first shift models like this happened in GPT-3 as early examples. Their eventual hope is that institutions worldwide agree on these wide bounds. In shorter terms, as the OpenAI, the default setting of their products will likely be quite constrained, but they plan to make it easy for users to change the behavior of the AI that they're using. 

As mentioned earlier, they are concerned about the late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race, needing more time to apply safety precautions adequately. Therefore, if a value-aligned safety concern project comes close to building AGI, as they have previously, they commit to stopping competing and start assisting others towards building and contributing to this project."

""I do think the AI community is making a terrible mistake by being full of hype on the near-term implications of generative AI,"" said Griffin at an event for Citadel's new class of interns in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Griffin also said that the fear of AI ending skilled jobs was far from reality.

In the past few months, AI has been the talk of the town with several companies announcing initiatives to get a piece of the technology. Earlier this month, Nvidia briefly made it to the $1T market cap as the stock rode a wave of investor exuberance surrounding AI.

Following the release of Microsoft -backed OpenAI's ChatGPT ‚Äî which takes written inputs from users and provides human-like response ‚Äî Chinese companies including Alibaba (BABA), SenseTime (OTCPK:SNTMF) and Baidu (BIDU) have launched their own generative AI services. Even Google's (GOOGL) (GOOG) AI technology is also set to power online travel agency Priceline's virtual travel tool, as per a report.

According to a recent study, Chinese organizations have launched 79 large language models ((LLMs)) in the past three years in an effort to boost their AI technology capabilities.

Here‚Äôs the problem with large language models: they are built on the past, everything we do is about the future,"" added Griffin, according to the report. ""We are at the start of the journey of large language models.""

However, Griffin noted that it will have real impact in the economy."

Bloomberg recently announced their [own AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). AI only goes up.

FactSet (FDS) is well-positioned to take advantage of the current AI hype in the financial data analysis space. With over [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog, FDS has a vast array of data and services that could be enhanced by partnering with an AI language model like ChatGPT. Moreover, FDS has already made strides in natural language processing (NLP) with their [Factset Query Language](https://go.factset.com/hubfs/Website_Downloads/Statistical%20Package%20Integration/Docs%203.0/TipsandTechniques.pdf) (FQL), which allows users to make natural language queries to financial data. However, FDS could further improve their NLP capabilities by leveraging the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) which Bloomberg has recently done with [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). This could enable FDS to develop more sophisticated natural language interfaces and improve the accuracy and speed of financial data analysis. Additionally, FDS has a strong reputation in the financial data space and is one of the few publicly traded companies that provide financial data, making it an attractive partner for AI language models and financial institutions looking for reliable data sources.

FDS hasn‚Äôt confirmed that they‚Äôre using LLMs yet, but they probably are given that they mention GPT in a [job posting](https://factset.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FactSetCareers/details/Machine-Learning-Engineer_R13291?q=GPT&__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=5bad2784-dc05-40fe-a68d-fee1a12cdc9b%7C397e76f1-32f7-4fbf-bd20-d38c0c14c7a9). They also have several blog posts on ChatGPT [as](https://insight.factset.com/chatgpt-and-decarbonizing-the-railroads) [well](https://insight.factset.com/understanding-chatgpt-the-promise-and-nuances-of-large-language-models).

FDS can leverage its [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog in a similar way to WolframAlpha‚Äôs collaboration with OpenAI. If they hook it up with ChatGPT or something similar, it can use these APIs to do financial analysis just like how [WolframAlpha enables ChatGPT to do math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOQV9VakBgE). It also allows the user to provide a query in natural language instead of needing to know how to code/read the API.

Just like the Bloomberg Query Language, FDS has Factset Query Language (FQL). FQL allows making interaction with financial data to be more natural. For example, ‚ÄúShow me companies with sales greater than the average sales of companies in the S&P 500.‚Äù would translate to ‚ÄúFF_SALES(ANN,0)>UAVG(FG_CONSTITUENTS(SP50,0,CLOSE),FF_SALES(ANN,0))‚Äù. This feature allows users to ask queries in plain language without needing to write complex code or have extensive knowledge of financial terms.

One thing to worry about is AI ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù in which the AI provides inaccurate information which would obviously be bad for financial analysts. There are two types of hallucinations: open-domain, and closed-domain. Closed-domain hallucinations refer to situations where the AI makes something up, but the information was already in its context. A good example of this is asking ChatGPT to summarize something, but it provides an extra detail that was never given. Research shows good progress on reducing closed-domain hallucinations via [clever prompting and reward model training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf). If you watch the WolframAlpha demo, they mention working with OpenAI to create a special version of GPT4, and it shows since it is reliably using WolframAlpha‚Äôs output. The same techniques can be done for FDS‚Äôs APIs to reduce inaccuracies.

Just like every other AI stock that has gone up by an absurd amount, once FDS announces usage of ChatGPT, it‚Äôs going to moon. Some of the AI stocks are just regarded and don‚Äôt make any sense, but FDS is a legit use-case, so it has long term prospects as well."
115,XMTR ‚Äì Cheap AI Stock. Great Upside Potential. This One‚Äôs Gonna Be Good.,0,1498hx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1498hx4/xmtr_cheap_ai_stock_great_upside_potential_this/,31,1686750830.0,"*I‚Äôm a selfish bastard, so I usually don‚Äôt give away my best ideas but fuck it I could use the karma. Besides, my wife is on vacation with her boyfriend, so I had a lot of time to myself to actually do some quality due-diligence on this stock.*

**The Headline**

Xometry (XMTR) is a massively underappreciated play on how AI is going to change manufacturing ‚Äì and it‚Äôs pretty fuckin cheap right now.

**For Those of You Who Have a Fourth Grade Reading Level**

¬∑ XMTR connects the people who design shit with the people who can actually make that shit.

¬∑ They operate in a ~~$2,000,000,000,000~~ total addressable market.

¬∑ They use AI with better data than anyone else in the field (good moat).

¬∑ They have faced some short-term headwinds that have made the stock cheap (for now).

**The Business**

¬∑ XMTR has created a marketplace to connect product developers (NASA, BMW, Dell, SpaceX, you name it.) with manufacturers for custom parts manufacturing. This process used to be done through local connections, but, with XMTR's platform, this can be done much faster, cheaper, and at greater volume.

¬∑ They are doing this in a ginormous total addressable market sized at $2 trillion for global manufacturing where they only had revenue of $381 million for all of last year (but grew 75%!).

¬∑ XMTR is a newer company and in the early innings of user awareness where they have seen customers in industries from electric vehicle manufacturers, aerospace and defense, pharmaceuticals, consumer technology all grow spend at compounded annual growth rates between 121% up to 993%.

¬∑ Being the outright winner as a marketplace/having a first mover advantage is important as you can see with AirBnb, Amazon, and Uber who have won early to create significant value from digitizing their markets. Looking back, wouldn‚Äôt you have invested in Amazon at Day 1?

¬∑ This is playing out as competitors like [Fast Radius](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chicago-tech-company-fast-radius-files-for-chapter-11-after-the-spac-deal-216941/) and [Shapeway‚Äôs](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/shapeways-hit-with-nyse-non-compliance-notice-for-failing-to-meet-listing-standards-214028/) have either gone bankrupt or are very close.

**AI & Positive Feedback Loops**

¬∑ So, what‚Äôs the special sauce? [Artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/) and machine learning. They continue to create a positive feedback loop where every buyer attracts more sellers and thus attracts more buyers. For those of you who haven't attended an intro to business webinar like I have, this phenomenon is called a network effect.

¬∑ This entire flywheel is powered by the droves of quality data they are collecting. Proper pricing, matching, and lead times between product developers and the 625,000 manufacturers in the USA alone is difficult and takes YEARS to develop since it has never been done before.

¬∑ While they have had some hiccups that hurt near term numbers and caused some bears to huddle up, they now have better data and algorithms than anyone else in the market and have better trained their machines which keeps competitors from coming anywhere close to competing with them. I love a good moat, don‚Äôt you?

*\*NOT TO MENTION\* there are 10,000 owners of manufacturing shops retiring and selling their businesses every day to engineers that understand and have a use for XMTR‚Äôs tech offering.*

**A Good Deal**

¬∑ NVIDIA (NVDA) is trading at 20x sales and XMTR is at \~ 2x sales. At 1/10th the price but growing 70% faster over the last 12 months, XMTR is the AI play of a century (wow!).

¬∑ Short interest ratio at 11% and moving upwards as bears are peaking their heads out of the forest to push this thing back up to 20% again.

¬∑ Their bearish sentiments are wrong, and we‚Äôll be handsomely rewarded for our contrarianism.

During the Dot Com era dial up was the primary internet. Most homes didn‚Äôt have a computer or cell phones and Robinhood didn‚Äôt exist. Today we have fiber optic internet. More information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime. You can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food. Get anything you want, when you want it. If the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place, the bust may never have happened.

A primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 1998‚Äì99 allowing LOTS of startups to open with cheap money/borrowing. We don‚Äôt have that now and AI is still thriving.

Most companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom.

This isn‚Äôt the same. AI has been around for a while, for example IBM‚Äôs Watson, Apple‚Äôs SIRI, Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, the GPS reading the route instructions to you or Microsoft word checking your grammar and spelling on word documents. This is AI like it or not. We‚Äôve gotten so used to them we don‚Äôt even think of them as AI. ChatGPT is just another tool in the toolbox and it still has a LONG way to go before its good.

Most companies will take a while to implement AI as it has to be perfect when it‚Äôs released and people are trained to work with AI not for AI. For example when you order at Wendy‚Äôs and the AI bot can‚Äôt seem to get your order right, people need to be there to step in. Or when you reach out to your bank to get transaction details and the bot doesn‚Äôt understand, a person needs to be there.

A lot of the existing companies on the front lines of the AI revolution (NVDA,Intel, AMD, etc.) are seasoned companies with a long history of revenue. AI development and integration into the economic system (Education, Industrial, Medical, Customer Service, Agriculture, Finance, Media, Transportation, etc) is a great source of growth for all these companies and it‚Äôs a great opportunity for new companies to emerge and make our lives easier.

Everyone that has a job today can think of ATLEAST one way AI can improve what they do to make work easier.

This is the AI Revolution, The Artificial Intelligence Age, a new frontier. Not a bubble."
