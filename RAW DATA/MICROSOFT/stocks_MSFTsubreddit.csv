1,Google falls 3% pre-market as Microsoft gains 2% on reports that Samsung is considering Bing as default search engine across all devices,2989,12pcfpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12pcfpt/google_falls_3_premarket_as_microsoft_gains_2_on/,532,1681730699.0,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html)

 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Bing may replace Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search service on Samsung Electronics Co. devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. 

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground. Those include adding artificial intelligence features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported."
2,Microsoft reportedly plans to invest $10 billion in creator of buzzy A.I. tool ChatGPT,2474,108b31n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/108b31n/microsoft_reportedly_plans_to_invest_10_billion/,423,1673360727.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html

Microsoft plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup behind popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, according to a report from Semafor.

The deal is part of a funding round with other investors involved that would value OpenAI at a whopping $29 billion, Semafor reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It isn't clear whether the deal has been finalized but term sheets sent to prospective investors indicated the plan was to close the deal by the end of 2022, Semafor reported.

Microsoft will reportedly get a 75% share of OpenAI's profits until it makes back the money on its investment, after which the company would assume a 49% stake in OpenAI.

Microsoft and OpenAI were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

For several weeks, the tech world has been abuzz with chatter about ChatGPT. The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.

The AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.

A bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google. The company's Bing browser has only a small share of the global search engine market, however it is hoped the deal could help the firm chip away at Google's dominance by offering more advanced search capabilities.

In December, Morgan Stanley published a report examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share ""and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.""

OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November. Despite optimism over its potential, the project is burning through cash due to the overwhelming level of pressure on its servers arising from its virality. Five days after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Altman said that the chat research tool crossed 1 million users."
3,I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022,2422,x1fjlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x1fjlg/i_tried_4_paid_services_for_stock_selection_here/,204,1661855480.0,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits.

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

Intel (INTC): -29%

JFrog (FROG): -17%

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%
2. Redacted by mods: +7%

6. Inspire Medical Systems: +14%
7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

4,Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,2352,13rxgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rxgz6/cathie_woods_ark_invest_sold_most_of_its_nvidia/,405,1685058945.0,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if “such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that “many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.”

He added, without naming anyone, that this is because “people who have nothing to offer want to study AI,” but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, “studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield” is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an “A.I. race” akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that “there is already an A.I. arms race, it’s just we’re ahead, [and] it’s not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.”

He pointed out that the “single most important event” in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir’s AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield “just throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,” Karp said. He added, “especially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There’s only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.”"
6,CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,1755,12fnz2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12fnz2b/cnbc_chatgpt_is_already_generating_savings_for/,293,1680964593.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google’s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft’s Bing chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder’s network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

“If you’re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,” she said. “This is second nature to you.”

Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

“We saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,” Haller said. “I don’t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I’ve been in this world for a long time.”

ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

“If they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,” she said. “Or better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.”

She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm’s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

“We saw it first on the demand side,” Ghanta said. “Now we’re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.”

ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

“For example, ChatGPT is bad at math,” he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. “If you say, ″Let’s do this step by step’ in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,” he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

“The currency of the day in hiring hasn’t changed, it’s a resume,” Ghanta said. “Hiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.”

They’re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

“I encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,” he said. “From a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.”

There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs “exposed” to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

“When Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn’t trust pictures anymore,’” Haller said. “Since the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.”"
7,Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,1684,10vikbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/,478,1675718450.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”"

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest."

When a chatbot called ChatGPT hit the internet late last year, executives at a number of Silicon Valley companies worried they were suddenly dealing with new artificial intelligence technology that could disrupt their businesses.

But at Microsoft, it was a cause for celebration. For several years, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, had been putting the pieces in place for this moment.

In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco company that designed ChatGPT. And in the years since, it has quietly invested another $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the investment who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.

The $3 billion paid for the huge amounts of computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. And it meant that Microsoft could rapidly build and deploy new products based on the technology.

____


It has already been a home run partly because Satya was prescient enough to make the bet three years ago, and because all applications will be generative in the future,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing partner at Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group.

MSFT technology:

A year later, Microsoft invested $1 billion in the company and committed to building the supercomputer technologies OpenAI’s enormous models would demand while becoming its “preferred partner for commercializing” its technologies. OpenAI later officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft, allowing the company to directly add them to Microsoft products and services.

In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). It’s amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isn’t being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable and revolutionary as many of these companies still claim to be. Look at Tesla’s “self driving” being a complete failure in actually delivering what was promised. It’s recent leaks show insult to injury with its thousands of “Full Self-Driving” complaints. There have been no notable advancements since 2017 in AI (with the Vaswani et al paper), but these companies and singularity loving redditors would love for you to believe so. This type of “AI” is nothing but a trend, and an arguably unethical one at that. It has the potential to boost productivity substantially, but it’s as close to replacing white collar workers as robots are to replacing blue collar ones due to its lack of high level reasoning. True general intelligence to replace workers advances incrementally which is still up for debate if it can even be done at all.

But the most obvious, pressing issue is with “get some poor asian kid on the other side of the world to do your homework for you” Chegg. This company has not sufficiently prepared for the reckoning.

I've used Chat GPT for my own Computer Organization & Architecture HW and Computer Science HW (as a learning tool \*wink\*). It's an amazing, versatile tool if you put sufficient details in the prompt, whiiiiiich is why it’s superior to Chegg.

It can solve problems that haven't even been added to their database yet - like concerning new assignments or material from new professors. You can also ask it to elaborate and explain certain problem-solving steps, which Chegg cannot provide if there's only one solution uploaded - you've got as much as the poor asian kid decided to write down 💀

[College students](https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html) are the most significant demographic of Chegg, and the competition of free vs. $15/mo for generally low cash flow customers is a no brainer. If you’re concerned about the plan for premium Chat GPT, according to [CEO Sam Altman](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-plus-free-openai-paid-version-chatbot-2023-2)  “users will still be able to access the chatbot for free” post release.

While Chat GPT doesn't have verification of veracity (truthfulness) nor precise equation manipulation yet, we can expect it and competing AIs to pursue such features moving forward. If equation solver-extraordinaire Wolfram Alpha has been publicly available for the ballpark of a decade, it does not seem like a stretch that this technology will be difficult to implement. Google’s equivalent “Apprentice Bard” is also coming “very soon” according to [CEO Sundar Pichai.](https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-sparks-googles-upcoming-ai-upgrade/)

After dropping more than 33% last year amid aggressive interest rate hikes and stubborn inflation, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has recovered roughly 12% in 2023. Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors’ bubble this week. 

Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He’s expected to discuss February’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated “ongoing” rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.”

Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not “overly hawkish”—repeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance—every time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.

As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell “retreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone” during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed’s benchmark interest rate."

Scroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.

&#x200B;

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian’s market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

&#x200B;

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They’ve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn’t Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn’t a grandstanding visionary. He’s slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

&#x200B;

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn’t have close friends, is cut off from his family and can’t hold down a relationship. There isn’t a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

&#x200B;

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they’d need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn’t a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn’t benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn’t as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

# TLDR

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

Earnings: $2.45 per share, vs. $2.23 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $52.86 billion, vs. $51.02 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue is projected to be up 3% from a year earlier, which would mark a second straight quarter of growth below 10%. Before that, percentage expansion had been in double digits in every quarter since 2017.

Results are expected to be weakest in Microsoft’s personal computing division, which includes Windows operating system licenses sold to PC makers, along with Xbox consoles and Surface devices. Research firm Gartner estimated that PC shipments declined 30% in the quarter.

Microsoft’s Azure cloud business remains a bright spot for the company, but growth is slowing. Analysts surveyed by CNBC expect 26.5% growth from a year earlier, while analysts polled by StreetAccount predict 27.2% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose the size of its Azure business in dollars.

In the fiscal second quarter, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew by 31%, down from 35% in the prior period.

Investors have another reason to be excited about Azure, which has aligned itself with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

During the quarter, Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and said it would draw on the company’s artificial intelligence models for a new version of its Bing search engine and enhancements to the Microsoft 365 productivity software.


Microsoft shares have risen 17% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up less than 8% over the same period.

Executives will discuss the results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

21,Google is panicking! Google Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I. Fight,673,10i2ey2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10i2ey2/google_is_panicking_google_calls_in_help_from/,348,1674337122.0,"A rival chatbot has shaken Google out of its routine, with the founders who left three years ago re-engaging and more than 20 A.I. projects in the works.

Last month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival’s new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google’s $149 billion search business.

Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google’s artificial intelligence product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google’s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put A.I. front and center in their plans.

The re-engagement of Google’s founders, at the invitation of the company’s current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT.

The bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.

The new A.I. technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Mr. Pichai declared a “code red,” upending existing plans and jump-starting A.I. development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.

At the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its work force. On Friday, the company said it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed “to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,” Mr. Pichai wrote in a note to employees.

This is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,” said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a start-up called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. “ChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, ‘Here’s what a compelling new search experience could look like.’” Mr. Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of A.I. to stay competitive.

Since stepping back from day-to-day duties, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Mr. Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying car start-ups and disaster relief efforts.

Their visits to the company’s Silicon Valley offices in the last few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls “Other Bets,” one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.

But they have long been keen on bringing A.I. into Google’s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Mr. Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Mr. Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, “Why can’t it automatically write that email for you?” In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading A.I. research lab based in London.

But several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.

The capabilities of AI tools like ChatGPT justify the fervor surrounding the technology. From clearing exams to posing as a potential threat to several jobs, ChatGPT is advancing at an impeccable rate. Alongside its other capacities, a new report highlights how the AI tool can now predict stock moves.

According to Bloomberg, ChatGPT can now foretell the fate of stocks based on article headlines.

ChatGPT was employed to carry out market-relevant tasks, and two studies about the same were released. One of the studies used the chatbot to determine if Federal Reserve pronouncements were aggressive or meek, and the other to determine whether stock-related headlines were favorable or unfavorable.

The AI chatbot cleared both the above-mentioned tests. This further highlighted how a multitude of text from news articles, tweets, and even speeches could be converted into trading signals.

**Here’s how ChatGPT was used to determine the movement of the stock market:**

The title of the second study was “Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models.” The University of Florida’s Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang prompted ChatGPT to pose as a financial professional. Following this, they asked the chatbot to analyze business news articles. Since the chatbot’s training data didn’t cover the time after late 2021, they employed news from that time period.

The study discovered a statistical relationship between the stock’s future movements and the replies provided by ChatGPT. This further indicates that the technology was able to accurately comprehend the significance of the news. Bloomberg went on to share an instance from the study,

“In an example about whether the headline “Rimini Street Fined $630,000 in Case Against Oracle” was good or bad for Oracle, ChatGPT explained that it was positive because the penalty “could potentially boost investor confidence in Oracle’s ability to protect its intellectual property and increase demand for its products and services.”

Furthermore, it should be noted that this is not new on Wall Street. Analysts have been using the same language models that underpin the chatbot to guide several strategies. However, the results suggest that OpenAI’s technology is now capable of understanding subtlety and context at a higher degree than ever before.

Slavi Marinov, head of machine learning at Man AHL, addressed the same and said,

“It’s one of the rare cases where the hype is real.”

New research from Goldman Sachs indicates that around 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by the rise of generative AI systems. The study found that about two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and generative AI could replace up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers, particularly those in the US legal and administrative sectors, are at higher risk of being affected by new AI tools. This is because the legal services industry consists of a relatively small number of occupations already susceptible to AI automation. Despite the potential disruptions, the widespread implementation of generative AI could lead to labor cost savings and the creation of new jobs, such as prompt engineers who write text to test AI chatbots.

* Microsoft shares climbed 3.2% to a record Thursday and are now up 46% this year.
* The company could pick up $10 billion or more in annual artificial intelligence revenue from developers using its Azure cloud or OpenAI’s models, an executive said this week.
* JPMorgan analysts raised their price target on Microsoft stock Wednesday.

Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker’s growth prospects in artificial intelligence.

The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.

AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.

Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”

Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.

In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”

In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.

Scott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.

“Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.

“There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.

Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.

“While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.

With Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.

Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&P 500."

Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again? 

  
TL;dr  
People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this ""overvalued"" in my life. What is keeping it up?"

That reminded me of MSFT/Open AI.  Throwing a product out there (while ok, it does some nice things).  It would be VERY hard to believe GOOGL.  Who has run all sorts of AI tests/in healthcare with alpha fold (deepmind).  Its completely incompetent.

&#x200B;

Part of me is thinking Google is testing the waters, looking like they missed the boat, but they are letting their competition go first......and maybe fail.  That way they can see what the public likes and tweak their AI platform rather than being first to the market.  Its a bold move, but google has the most data......they are very astute.

While I have written about the Ad tech bubble and why its the worst since the great recession, GOOGLE IMO is the top dog in AI at the moment.  They are letting the other poker players flaunt their hands and then the royal flush will come out.

Also Baird 'failing' and these Sketchy 'google memo released that execs are angry over their missing AI'  its all a big show that google might be putting on to SLAP down competition later. 

I wouldn't bet against this.  Thoughts?"

BuzzFeed [said](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/our-way-forward?d_id=5419973&ref=bftwbuzzfeed&utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=bftwbuzzfeed) Thursday that it will work with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to use artificial intelligence to help create content for its audience, marking a milestone in how media companies implement the new technology into their businesses.

Jonah Peretti, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, told employees in a memo that they can expect “AI inspired content” to “move from an R&D stage to part of our core business.”

Peretti elaborated that the technology will be used to create quizzes, help with brainstorming, and assist in personalizing content to its audience. BuzzFeed, for now, will not use artificial intelligence to help write news stories, a spokesperson told CNN.

“To be clear, we see the breakthroughs in AI opening up a new era of creativity that will allow humans to harness creativity in new ways with endless opportunities and applications for good,” Peretti said. “In publishing, AI can benefit both content creators and audiences, inspiring new ideas and inviting audience members to co-create personalized content.”

“When you see this work in action it is pretty amazing,” Peretti added, vowing to “lead the future of AI-powered content.”

The news sent BuzzFeed’s sagging stock skyrocketing more than 150% in trading Thursday to more than $2 a share.

Media industry leaders have increasingly said that artificial intelligence will revolutionize their businesses.

While BuzzFeed is the biggest digital content creator to move to implement OpenAI’s technology into its business, some other outlets have taken similar steps.

CNET recently used an artificial intelligence tool to help write stories. But the process did not go smoothly, with a number of articles ultimately requiring corrections.

In a note published online Wednesday, CNET Editor-In-Chief Connie Guglielmo [apologized for the errors ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/tech/cnet-ai-tool-news-stories/index.html)and said new processes had been put in place to prevent them in the future.

But, Guglielmo said, the outlet will not shy away from using artificial intelligence moving forward.

“The process may not always be easy or pretty, but we’re going to continue embracing it – and any new tech that we believe makes life better,” Guglielmo wrote."
36,Tesla stock collapse - All you need to know - Part 1,229,zv1dxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zv1dxh/tesla_stock_collapse_all_you_need_to_know_part_1/,385,1671986177.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.

37,Microsoft Boosts Investment in ChatGPT Parent OpenAI,208,10jghuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10jghuc/microsoft_boosts_investment_in_chatgpt_parent/,33,1674491170.0,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327?mod=hp_LATEST)

Microsoft has agreed to expand its investment in OpenAI, the software company behind the popular artificial intelligence apps [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). 

Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and OpenAI [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) [the expanded investment](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/) on Monday. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Bloomberg reported that a person familiar with the discussions said the agreement covers $10 billion over multiple years. Microsoft [invested $1 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-artificial-intelligence-startup-11563813648?mod=article_inline) in OpenAI in 2019 and made an additional investment of an undisclosed amount in 2021.

Neither Microsoft nor OpenAI could immediately be reached for comment.

Microsoft said the new agreement “extends our ongoing collaboration across AI supercomputing and research and enables each of us to independently commercialize the resulting advanced AI technologies.” The company added that it will use OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products, and introduce software built on OpenAI technology.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”

OpenAI said in a blog post that the “multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment” will allow the company “to continue our independent research and develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.”

Adding the natural-language capabilities of ChatGPT to Microsoft’s Bing search engine could make it a more formidable competitors to market leader Google, although parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also has made substantial bets on artificial intelligence software, acquiring the AI start-up DeepMind in 2014.

In a research note, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that while Bing holds a smart share of the search engine market, “Microsoft still seeks to gain share vs. Google’s dominant search engine by offering more advanced search capabilities and language models that could take market share away from Google over time.”

Ives also sees applications for the software in Outlook, Office, and videogame software."

Earnings per share (EPS): $1.05 vs $1.18 per share expected, according to Refinitiv 

Revenue: $76.05 billion, vs. $76.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:

YouTube advertising revenue: $8.25 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google Cloud revenue: $7.43 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.32 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google’s core ad business is expected to report minimal expansion from a year earlier, and growth is likely to remain in the single digits until late 2023, based on analyst estimates.

A slowing economy and competition from TikTok have hurt Google as well as digital ad rivals Snap and Facebook. Earlier this week, Snap reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Facebook parent Meta topped estimates but still recorded a 4% decline in sales.

In January, Alphabet announced it was laying off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce. The company told employees recently that more of them will be at risk for low performance ratings than in prior years.

Alphabet also cut staff in its health sciences unit Verily by 15%, citing a restructuring that will supposedly better position the business to seek financial independence.

Pressure is mounting for Google in other ways.

Artificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is viewed as posing a risk to Google’s search engine. Executives teased that the company may introduce a similar product to the public at some point this year. CNBC reported this week that Google is internally experimenting with several potential products that could influence its search business.

In January, the U.S. Justice Department filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, this one targeting its advertising business. It marked the first federal lawsuit against Google filed during the Biden administration.

Google is now showing its willingness to invest heavily in live sports. During the fourth quarter, the company agreed to pay $2 billion per year for the next seven years for YouTube to own the exclusive rights for “NFL Sunday Ticket.”

40,On Tesla's valuation (Part Trois),160,y8sdc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/,184,1666254030.0,"Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

> We have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.

Following Q3, this was slightly disappointing at 17.2%. Lower than Q1 despite higher deliveries, in part due to lower deliveries compared to production as Tesla is shifting away from end-of-quarter delivery pushes (20K cars were on a boat at the end of the quarter that previously would've been sold before quarter end). That said, it's still up 18% or 2600 basis points YoY, easily industry leading for high volume automakers (BMW is second at 14.5%), and Tesla guided for record high margins in Q4.

I also said:

> While we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.

Since then, we have heard rumours that Berlin is expected to reach at least comparable margins to Shanghai, despite significantly higher wages. While this still remains uncertain, it would certainly reinforce their bullish sentiment on margins quoted above.

Then I said:

> I think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.

> That said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.

Since then, it appears that Texas and Berlin are not ramping faster than Shanghai did. 400K this year is looking entirely impossible, with ~100K being more likely.

That said, Shanghai has continued to ramp beyond expectation and is now at a 1.2M unit run rate. Peak production so far has been 57K Model Ys in August and 30K Model 3s in September, which would put the factory's maximum real output (remember factories can never reach their full run rate due to holidays and other downtime) at over 1M vehicles per year (highest volume car factory in the world by about 20%) or 250K per quarter. Well above even Q1's 170K.

------------------------------

**The numbers**

Updating the expected numbers from my previous posts (you can go back to them to compare what has changed if you like) based on the latest information, my Bear and Bull case numbers are as follows:

**Sales**

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,350,000|1,500,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,600,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,700,000|

**ASP**

Last time, ASPs increased significantly, from $50,000 to ~$57,500. In Q3 2022, they decreased slightly to $54,350. I expect these prices to start to increase again with the upcoming tax incentives, as Tesla mentioned they expect to take the full tax incentive from the Inflation Induction Act for vehicles, battery production and battery sourcing for a total of $10K+ per car. I expect this will offset the reduced demand from the recession and further increase ASPs to ~$57,5K in 2023 and then remain stable while Tesla continues to drive down costs.


**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs ($54K for 2022, $57,5K for 2023 and 2024) and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$73B|$81B|
|**2023**|$115B|$150B|
|**2024**|$150B|$213B|

**Operating Margin**

A year ago I said:

> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

This is where I was most wrong after Q1. Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. Since then, operating margin has decreased to 17.2%, with an expected record operating margin in Q4. This makes me slightly less confident about their steep increase in margins, so I will be adjusting those slightly to the downside.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|17%|19%|
|**2023**|19%|23%|
|**2024**|21%|27%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$12.4B|$15.4B|
|**2023**|$21.9B|$34.5B|
|**2024**|$31.5B|$57.5B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $700B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|56|45|
|**2023**|32|20|
|**2024**|22|12|

**PEG**

Since PE ratios are pretty useless by themselves, I've added a PEG rating this time. Large caps traditionally tend to float at PEG ratios between 1.5 and 3.5. That said, extreme growth companies like Tesla tend to have slightly lower PEG ratios, as investors assume the growth will come down more rapidly over time. So perhaps a PEG between 1 and 2 is more reasonable.

Also worth to note is that only 1.6% of companies in the S&P have a PEG of below 0.5, and 0.2 is the lowest PEG rating in the entire S&P. As a general rule of thumb though, anything below a PEG of 1 is typically considered undervalued.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|0.45|0.25|
|**2023**|0.42|0.16|
|**2024**|0.50|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

After Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap, I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024. With a growth rate between 44% and 67% respectively, Tesla would have a PEG rating of between 0.50 and 0.18. To get to normal PEG levels, that means Tesla stock would have to grow between 100% and 1,011% from here through Q1 2025.

Interesting to note is how Tesla only needs to double earnings to have a lower PE ratio than the S&P average, when high growth companies tend to have much higher PEs than the average; I'm expecting Tesla to almost 3x their earnings in just 3 years in the bear case.

Also worth mentioning is how, even in the bear case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($22B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the bull case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is entirely false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business (including their automotive software sales), as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company.

It's been quite some time since I wrote a DD on WSB so I thought I would share this one. Now, I know it's controversial--Robinhood--but making money isn't controversial and I personally believe there's a lot of money to be made on Robinhood's stock as we enter a new bull market. I wrote this DD a few days ago, the price has moved a little higher since. Some pictures are missing because VisualMod won't allow some of the content from Robinhood's roadmap.

State of the Stock

Robinhood’s time in the stock market has been an arduous one and not one without controversy. The stock went public in a hotly anticipated IPO at about $36.41 on July 29th, 2021. It saw tremendous interest in the first week of trading reaching an overly lofty value at \~$85 a share before starting to sell off. This sell off has relentlessly continued and in many places, you will find negative commentary on the stock.

I personally believe that the stock’s price action bottomed on June 17th, 2022 at about $6.84 a share. Since then the stock has been slowly plodding along and striking higher lows, which I will illustrate later in the charting.

I also believe that the stock’s story is close to turning around and could get more positive attention in the later half of this year. I am going to talk about the balance sheet, cost cutting, charts, and the controversy.

I will be limiting my comments on the balance sheet to lines that I believe deserve notice. For this post, I will be comparing Robinhood to their old school rival, Charles Schwab.

The Balance Sheet

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c8fg6s92v96b1.jpg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0fe0c434b509162b2c24391c34b6dccf4413e4

$HOOD - Balance Sheet

Overall, I read Robinhood’s balance sheet as being quite strong. Particularly in the amount of cash and sort term investments that the company is carrying. At 5.46 Billion in cash and 1.52 Billion in short term investments the company can cover operating expenses (excl. COGS) for about 3.5 years.

The company has also shared that the short term investments are in <1 year term treasuries. Which is quite a good decision given the current rates. I only wish they had purchased a little more than 500 million or so.

As of this writing (6-11-23, 6-15-23 WSB), Robinhood carries a market cap of \~$8.5 billion as well. Their cash position is nearly the size of their entire equity. In comparison, $SCHW (Charles Schwab) has about $75 billion in cash and a market cap of 100 Billion. I believe that the market is underestimating how Robinhood can deploy that cash.

Lastly, Robinhood is very close (9.41 market) to their book value per share (7.83). In comparison, $SCHW has a book value per share of 15.36 and is trading at 55.0 in the market. I believe this illustrates that Robinhood is quite cheap, even after the June ’22 bounce when it was cheaper than the book.

&#x200B;

$HOOD - FCF

Next, the cashflow at Robinhood is quite good and turned positive in Q4’22. Whereas their rivals are experiencing negative free cash flow during this same period. Robinhood, on a relative basis for this metric, looks to be outperforming during the banking crisis.

During their earnings calls they have also reported a net increase in deposits as well as assets under custody (AUC) increasing by an impressive 26% due to the run on stocks in 2023.

(Omitted because of Visual Mod)

$HOOD - AUC

What I find most interesting about this is that customer cash in Robinhood has steadily grown to $11 billion from $2 billion at IPO. It has been on an impressive path of growth. I believe this is the result of their strong “Brokerage Cash Sweep” program and the rates they’ve been able to offer.

They have been able to effectively remove the friction between treasury yield and their customers. This also creates a beneficial situation where their clients can deploy capital quickly, while maintaining some yield from their cash. Effectively, creating productive reserves for their customers who can choose to deploy it at any moment right on their app.

It should be noted that since the may operating data was released AUC has grown another $4.4 billion in deposits to $81.8 Billion. (See $HOOD's operating data release for May)

$HOOD - Profitability

Lastly, the company itself is quite close to profitability. The next 4 quarters are projected by broader WallStreet to come in at an EPS of about -0.01 to -0.03. Any positive change in their costs or earnings could lead to a surprise profit. Such as cash from treasury yield, cost cutting measures, new products, or increased business. The company itself continues to stress, that they are becoming leaner as time goes on. I believe that to be true.

Cutting Costs – The Layoffs

In 2022, Robinhood performed several rounds of lay offs. This allowed them to cut Q2 ’22 and Q3 ’22 operating expenses significantly (excl. COGS). This does not appear to have impacted their revenue growth and has given them the added benefit of being ‘right sized’. And to the best of my knowledge, no further lay offs are currently on the table. In fact, their revenue is now higher than it has ever been since IPO at $447 million and is pushing them ever closer to profitability.

2023 Road Map – 4 Catalysts

$HOOD - 2023 Roadmap

(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)

$HOOD - 2023 roadmap cont.

Now that we’ve talked about cost cutting, let’s take a look at the road map and see if there are opportunities for fundamental growth. I will list out 4 that I believe can have a positive impact on their business.

* Options Trading in Cash Accounts
* Margin Outside Gold
* Futures Trading
* UK Market Expansion

Lets tackle the first two on the list.

Options Trading in Cash Accounts should continue to grow their existing business. This should increase their revenue generated per user as more current customers have access to more products. Options trading is particularly popular among Robinhood’s customer demographic.

Margin Outside Gold I find personally controversial. I personally don’t believe in using margin. Regardless, it should also increase their revenue generated per user.

While both of these are improvements that could turn the company profitable for EPS. They are not as major as the next two items.

Futures trading would open an entire new market for the Robinhood user. I believe it is an incredibley potent catalyst for their user base and will allow their customers to trade more often and in new ways.

>Robinhood advancing offerings for active traders  
In March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant license and, if approved on a typical timeline, we  
expect to launch futures trading by the end of 2023.

UK Market Expansion should allow them to acquire a significant number of new users.

>Robinhood continues to explore growth opportunities, expands access globally  
With an experienced team leading and an existing license in place, we believe we’re on track for our  
ambitious goal of launching brokerage services in the UK by the end of the year.

To summarize, I believe expanding into a new country, the UK, and providing futures trading to their existing customers they expand their business significantly over time.

Lets take a look now at the charts and see what we can find in the price action.

Charting A Path

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4bicwds7v96b1.jpg?width=3657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e43f8865553f0b084e90f4ccda1037695f21d236

$HOOD - Price Action 6-11-23, 1D

The first thing of note on Robinhood’s stock chart is that a series of higher lows have been put in. The price action, for the first time since IPO, is showing an increasing pattern in the price. I believe the stock has a classic Falling Wedge which I interpret as bullish. I believe the wedge has formed because of the positive developments in the balance sheet, cost cutting, and the future outlook.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/erv0vkq8v96b1.jpg?width=3685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf2f4868438765f62a9918afbf1bb099731801a7

$HOOD - MACD, 1D

Examining the MACD on the 1D time scale we also see higher lows put in as well as an MACD crossover onto the positive scale. Overall, I read the charts as having increasingly positive momentum. I also believe that momentum is growing, albeit slowly.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/64yu4wb9v96b1.jpg?width=3675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2acf46864c3b116cce6793fc0c9ac9ff8d6c1fe

$HOOD - DMI, 2D

Lastly, on the 2D time scale my favorite indicator, DMI, shows the bulls having taken control on \~May 24 2023. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that was the low after the most recent earnings report. I believe the majority of the bears have left the stock as evident by their strength at \~11.5. We also have seen the natural termination of the ADX which implies, to me, that the previous trading trend for the stock has come to an end. A new trend does appear to be forming. It could fizzle out, but that’s up to Robinhood’s management.

I believe all of the necessary setups are currently there for them to succeed as both a company and a stock.

Closing Thoughts & Possible RisksThe Demographic & The Controversy

I don't think I have to mention the controversy much here so I am re-writing this section for this post. Regardless...

I believe the controversay for $HOOD regarding GameStop is sorely misplaced and the majority of which is not real. When people 'poo-poo' robinhood I believe that they still use the app. Most of the posts still on this subreddit use it and the proof is in the data, Robinhood is continuing to grow assets under custody and trading volumes.

This could also be related to the flurry of trading activity seen in stocks related to AI in the past few months.

Heavy Insider Selling

An additional risk is that the insiders, specifically Tenev Vladimir, CEO & Bhatt Baiju, Chief Creative Officer, continue to sell large numbers of shares. This is creating an immense downward pressure on the stock price. If this pattern continues, it could contribute negatively to the stocks performance.

However, I believe that’s a non-issue if the company becomes profitable. I hope that we are approaching the end of the insider selling.

Crypto & SEC Action

Additionally, due to recent events, Robinhood has pulled 3 of their crypto offerings. I believe this is another mixed risk. While they will take a revenue hit by delisting those tokens, they may end up gaining users if customers of Coinbase or Binance decide to take their business elsewhere. **It could end up being beneficial to Robinhood, but there’s no way of knowing at this time.**

At the time of this writing there has been no report that I can find of Robinhood receiving a notice on the matters affecting Binance and Coinbase. Robinhood instead chose to remove the 3 affected securities voluntarily.

I believe this is the responsible thing to do and well advised. By taking pre-emptive action they are protecting their business from getting entangled in the matter and remaining compliant with the SEC. This is a value the company has stated a number of times during their earnings calls. I believe their actions demonstrate that value and is representative of good governance from the company leadership.

That said, the SEC could still take action against the company if they choose to do so. Therefore, it still carries some risk and must be considered.

Macro & Last Thoughts

So, here we are. It’s June 11th, 2023. Costs are significantly reduced and being controlled, notable Roadmap 2023 objectives are close, plans for new markets and offerings are approaching, and revenue continues to grow. The company is just a few pennies away on EPS from breaking even or potentially turning a profit. There is also significant distance from the drama surrounding GameStop, Robinhood, and WallStreetBets.

The charts are showing higher lows being put in place. More positive momentum looks to be coming into the stock via the MACD. Additionally, the bulls appear to have taken control via the DMI on \~May 24th, 2023.

I believe this is a case where a significant breakout could occur. It remains to be seen if it will, but I believe there is a potential trade here to the upside. It is not without downside risk though and that must be taken into consideration.

Current thinking in the market is that we may be entering a new bull market based off of recent SP500 closing levels. However, the macroeconomic picture still remains unclear. Particularly in regards to inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending.

If it is a new bull market, Robinhood may benefit from increased trading activity, but if the macroeconomic picture deteriorates it could degrade Robinhood’s business and affect the stock.

Either way, I personally believe the stock is in an interesting position within the market. The investor meeting is also on June 20th, 2023.

Trade carefully, trade wisely.

\-

**Original Post:**

Hi all, I'm new here but basically spent all night looking into the [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) and [Kerrisdale.](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/)

I'm long on C3 - so I'm as biased as Kerrisdale here, but apparently, that doesn't keep people from taking their word for granted, either. I have a degree in Finance, worked at a big-four accounting firm, in the financial industry (upper management), and am now a business owner (that was too lazy to create a new account for posting this - that's why you'll find me posting all kinds of UE5 stuff, otherwise. My dirty hobby...)

But I'm a hopelessly logical investor, meaning I couldn't figure out why Kerrisdale's letter to Deloitte yesterday moved the markets at all. So I needed to understand the whole situation better and digged deeper.

I went through C3's financials and Kerrisdale's report and looked at their letter to the Auditor, and here are my two cents on their March 6th report and their letter to Deloitte. Apologies for the lengthy post, but it's a complex topic.

It is worth questioning whether Kerrisdale's attempt to undermine C3 serves to manipulate market perceptions, particularly when considering the firm's history of short-selling and ongoing [legal scrutiny.](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/regulation/doj-sec-probe-dozens-of-firms-in-short-selling-sting)

Let's start by shortly going over Kerrisdale's report from March 6th.

Kerrisdale's report conveniently overlooks C3's unique value proposition and casts doubt on the company's competitive advantage. However, this dismissal seems disingenuous, given the distinct position C3 occupies in the AI software market.

Contrary to the report's implications, C3's industry-specific AI solutions set it apart from the likes of IBM, Google, and Amazon. The company's focus on sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services demonstrates its commitment to providing tailored solutions that address the unique challenges faced by these industries.

The report also paints a bleak picture of C3's growth rates, suggesting that they are unsustainable. However, the data and industry trends tell a different story.

AI adoption is in its early stages across a variety of industries, with tremendous potential for growth. The ongoing digitization of industries and the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions are good for C3's prospects.

C3's ability to secure long-term contracts with major clients demonstrates the trust and satisfaction customers have in its products and services. This contradicts Kerrisdale's pessimistic outlook and raises suspicions about the firm's motives. They basically take one of C3's strengths (their ability to build long-term partnerships and client relations) and give it a negative spin.

Kerrisdale's report attempts to pigeonhole C3 as a company reliant on the energy sector, potentially to create uncertainty and fear in the market. But this claim conveniently omits the company's broader diversification strategy.

C3 has made significant strides in expanding into healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, proving its ability to penetrate new markets and adapt to different industry needs. This diversification not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.

The report also casts doubt on C3's future competitiveness by highlighting declining R&D spending. This interpretation, however, seems deliberately misleading when considering the broader context of the company's strategy and expertise.

Streamlining R&D spending could be a strategic move by C3 to optimize resources and concentrate on the most promising projects. It is important to recognize that R&D spending is not always directly proportional to innovation or product development success.

Moreover, C3's existing technological expertise and intellectual property provide a strong foundation for future growth. The report's attempt to misrepresent the company's R&D spending is... questionable.

All in all, I'd say that C3's unique competitive advantage, growth potential, diversification strategy, and technological expertise paint a more optimistic outlook for the company's future prospects than Kerrisdale's report suggests. As AI continues to transform industries, C3's targeted offerings are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, in my opinion. Of note to me is their [ESG product](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-esg/) \- ESG will be a really, really big thing in the near future, especially here in the EU, in the near future.

My opinion: investors and market participants should be mindful of the potential for market manipulation and misinformation, especially when considering reports from firms with questionable motives and legal standing.

Let's finally move on to what caused yesterday's market movements. Kerrisdale's letter to the auditor, Deloitte. Keep in mind that this is just my take on it. But I think that my opinion is not entirely unqualified.

**TL;DR: Deloitte is the biggest accounting firm in the US, and it basically comes down to this: you either trust a short-seller publishing an open letter going hand-in-hand with a well-timed media campaign at a conspicuously opportune moment (C3 was about to really take off and obliterate their short position), or you trust that C3's financials, on which Deloitte signed off on, are correct. Your call.**

Slightly longer version:

Kerrisdale Capital sent a letter to C3's auditor, raising concerns about the company's accounting and disclosure practices. The letter questions the company's revenue recognition methods, particularly for long-term contracts, and the impact on financial results.

C3 has consistently provided transparent financial results, as evidenced by their fiscal Q1, Q2, and Q3 2023 reports. The company has experienced steady revenue growth and diversified its client base, showcasing a strong business model.

C3's financial reports adhere to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), ensuring that revenue recognition and other financial practices are in line with industry standards.

**As per US GAAP guidelines, companies recognize revenue when the performance obligations under a contract are satisfied.** C3's long-term contracts are structured to deliver AI software solutions and services over time, and the company recognizes revenue accordingly.

It is essential to emphasize that C3's revenue recognition practices are compliant with the accounting standards and have been consistently applied across all financial reporting periods.

In their own March 6th report (page 13), Kerrisdale calls out C3 for their long product cycle (6-18 months). **Considering C3 is a rapidly growing company that closed bookings of about $650 million in Q3 FY 23, it's hardly surprising that ""the company’s accounts receivable have ballooned"", according to their letter to the auditor.**

With C3.ai's strong bookings performance in Q3, it is reasonable to expect a corresponding increase in unbilled receivables. This growth in receivables is a natural consequence of the company's expanding business and long-term contracts, reflecting the ongoing demand for its AI solutions.

On page 13 of their report, Kerrisdale acknowledges that C3 has a long product cycle, ranging from 6 to 18 months. This admission, coupled with the growth in unbilled receivables, suggests that Kerrisdale's claims are inconsistent and contradictory.

**The long product cycle means that C3's revenue recognition is spread across multiple reporting periods, which naturally leads to a growth in unbilled receivables.** This growth aligns with US GAAP guidelines.

The contradictory nature of Kerrisdale's claims raises questions about their understanding of US GAAP or their willingness to misrepresent financial information intentionally. It is essential to consider the possibility of malicious intent, particularly in light of the firm's ongoing legal scrutiny and history of short-selling.

The US Department of Justice and the SEC are currently investigating dozens of firms, including Kerrisdale Capital, for potential market manipulation through short-selling schemes. I found relatively little information on this, but little or unsubstantiated information apparently suffices. I quoted one of several articles earlier in this post.

Given this backdrop, Kerrisdale's claims regarding C3's accounting and disclosure practices might be an attempt to manipulate market sentiment and cast doubt on the company's financial integrity.

In light of the transparent financial results provided by C3 and the company's adherence to US GAAP guidelines, Kerrisdale's claims regarding accounting and disclosure issues appear to be unfounded.

**In conclusion, C3.ai's growth in unbilled receivables is a plausible outcome of its strong Q3 bookings performance and long product cycle.** Kerrisdale's contradictory claims and potential misunderstanding or manipulation of US GAAP guidelines warrant skepticism and caution, IMO.

I expect Deloitte to back up C3 in their FY 23 audit opinion, voiding Kerrisdale's claims. I think the whole thing is a well-executed publicity stunt by a short-seller that was facing serious trouble from the stock being about to take off. I would have done it the same way. Even including the SEC, which is/was investigating Kerrisdale, in their letter is a bold move, but implying regulatory action/fraud, is exactly what Kerrisdale needed to ""cover their ass"" here and get the much-needed market reaction. Hats off to them, textbook execution.

So that's it. Thanks for reading, if you even made it this far. Make of it what you want, as I'm as biased as Kerrisdale on this."
45,Buy Microsoft stock on the coming ChatGPT-enabled Bing,126,104a6h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/104a6h0/buy_microsoft_stock_on_the_coming_chatgptenabled/,198,1672952792.0,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) was a disappointment for its shareholders in 2022. But the new year will likely be the one of “recovery”, a D.A. Davidson analyst said in a note this morning.

Microsoft stock could climb to $270

On Thursday, Gil Luria recommended that investors buy Microsoft stock at the current discount as it has upside to $270, which translates to a more than 20% increase from here.

He’s bullish primarily on the tech behemoth’s $1.0 billion investment in OpenAI – an artificial intelligence research lab that operates “ChatGPT”.   

Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside. Longer-term, incorporating ChatGPT into Bing may provide MSFT with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance.

A day earlier, “The Information” said Microsoft was working with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into its flagship search engine.

OpenAI investment to benefit Azure as well

Interestingly, the D.A. Davidson analyst doesn’t expect OpenAI to benefit “Bing” only. In fact, Azure – its cloud platform stands to benefit just as much from the said investment. His note reads:

We’ve heard estimates between $250 million to $1.0 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI, much of which is being spent on Azure. We expect those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of GPT 4.0 later this year and the many product offshoots that’ll link to OpenAI via APIs.

In just over a month of its launch, ChatGPT has surpassed 1.0 million in terms of user count. Luria is also convinced that the multinational is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn (find out more).

The Nasdaq-listed firm is set to report its Q2 results later this month. Consensus is for it to earn $2.28 a share versus the year-ago $2.48. Versus its high in mid-August, Microsoft stock is down about 25% at writing."

Given the company’s future prospects, future profitability estimates, and the current price of risk, I estimated the intrinsic value of Facebook at $420b or $156 per share, with a 1-year price target at $171 per share, implying a 23% upside.

## The Metaverse is Coming, Later

Meta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.

Staking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn’t a bad tactic to “get it done”, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)’s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.

### Reinvesting Into the Business

Meta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\*cough\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.

### More or Better Content

As a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.

Regarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:

## Valuation

I expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.

As a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.

[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)

You can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company’s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.

### Risks

Meta’s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its “shorts” feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces “cheaper” content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*

Meta’s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.

The metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say “no” to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.

## Conclusion

The market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.

Meta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.

Within the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660), there are a few things that can help you in your analysis:

* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.
* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.
* Intrinsic analysis isn’t always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet. Pay attention to the implied EV/Sales ratio, which is based on a regression model that tries to find out if the market is underpricing the stock. It has its flaws, but it may help.
* Take a look at the decision tree at the bottom. It runs a few checks to see which strategies are appropriate for the stock."

Looking back 5 years ago in 2018 when PayPal released their Q1 earnings report at the time, the business was valued slightly more (\~$80B) than what it's valued at today (\~$71B) after their 2023 Q1 earnings report.

However, the numbers tell a story of a completely different business.

**Revenue**: $3.69B VS $7.04B (\~90%+)

**TPV**: $132B VS $354B (\~168%+)

**FCF**: $737M VS $1B (\~35%+)

The business is guiding for lower top-line quarter on quarter at 7-8% now VS 16-18% 5 years ago.

Fundamentally though, how is it possible for this business to be so punished by the market? Am I missing something or should I be unloading big bucks on PayPal? Based on their EPS forecast of $4.95 this year (up 20% from the year before), it now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of **13**...

Is it that PayPal was so disgustingly overvalued in 2018 that the valuation is now normalised? Or is the market pricing in an imminent top/bottom line decline (which is contradicting to PayPal's guidance)?

I just don't see it. I see a market that is punishing a strong performing company for not being sexy or milking the term ""AI"".

The day when white-collar jobs are replaced by a big silicon brain is fast approaching. But at least now we have the extraordinary opportunity to invest in the technology that will soon replace us (especially Microsoft, but also Alphabet). My thoughts on this are below.

# Summary

Transformer-based neural networks, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 behind ChatGPT, will fundamentally change the way we interact with computers and develop software. Microsoft and OpenAI have already launched Github Copilot, a self learning AI code generator. OpenAI's technology will enable Microsoft to offer unrivaled services to businesses. While Alphabet is likely to have similarly advanced technology up its sleeve, Microsoft is now in pole position to drive and profit from the AI revolution. In contrast to this, the potential threat to Alphabet's Google Search by the integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's search engine Bing is overestimated. A head-to-head race in AI between Microsoft and Alphabet will gain momentum and produce mind-blowing technologies. Microsoft is currently ahead of the game, but both stocks are great long-term investments.

# A Whole New Way to Interact With Computers

Over the past few decades, computing power has gotten cheaper, while the demand for programmers has exploded. This explains the rapid rise of high-level programming languages like Python, which make programming easier and faster than low-level programming languages like C++, sometimes at the cost of efficient computation. However, even ""easy to learn"" programming languages require a lot of theoretical knowledge, practice and experience. As a result, it often takes armies of highly paid software developers and significant investment to turn ideas into market-ready software.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 1: I asked OpenAI's DALL-E 2 to paint \\""an oil painting about how artificial intelligence will change the way we live\\"" \(DALL-E 2\)](https://preview.redd.it/1lthm3ejb1da1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae4cc7362aaa41fbd16dcdfdbe7efe1a386d4282)

In 2017, the invention of transformer-based neural networks by a team of [researchers at Google Brain](https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/) sparked a second revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models are based on this technology, culminating in the release of the state-of-the-art GPT model [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) in late November 2022. ChatGPT's impressive ability to write prose and even poetry reached [one million users](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353) within a few days of its release.

In the following, I will focus on a single capability of ChatGPT that has not yet received the attention it deserves: ChatGPT is able to program in common programming languages like Python or C++. ChatGPT is therefore able to translate any idea you formulate in natural language into source code. This will speed up all parts of software development and fundamentally change the way we interact with computers. But let's just ask ChatGPT for its own opinion:

>ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate code quickly and accurately can help developers and organizations automate repetitive tasks, speed up development and deployment, and ultimately drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry. (ChatGPT, OpenAI)

# What ChatGPT Can Already Do

To make a long story short, ChatGPT's programming skills blew me away, but let me show you what I mean. Since the Internet is full of code examples, I assumed that ChatGPT has seen an enormous amount of programming problems when it was trained. I asked ChatGPT to write a completely useless and therefore unique program in the Python programming language that would be able to web scrape the P/E ratios of all profitable companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and plot them against the length of the stock tickers (e.g. 4 for ""AAPL"" or 3 for ""JPM""). ChatGPT did the job in a few seconds and wrote the program in 31 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments). The first version returned an error message. When I told ChatGPT about it, it automatically identified the error and corrected the program accordingly. In the end, the program returned the desired plot, even with the correct axis labels (Fig. 2). Not only does ChatGPT produce surprisingly elegant code, it also adds informative comments to improve readability (e.g. ""Define the Dow Jones Industrial Index tickers""). Comments are non-executed annotations in the source code of a program to explain to a human reader, for example, what a piece of code is supposed to do.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 2: A useless program developed by ChatGPT: DJIA P\/E ratios vs. stock ticker length.](https://preview.redd.it/5mdvjmarb1da1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=140cbc93f43fc45b2aca777f7ab6184af01cfd0e)

That was impressive, but more of a script than a real program. Hence task number two: I asked ChatGPT in plain English if it could write an ant simulation with the following specifications: The simulated ants should start from random positions and move randomly across the screen. They should leave a scent trail (which dissipates after a time *t*) and be able to smell scent trails within a radius *r*. If an ant smells a scent trail, it will follow it. It took ChatGPT three attempts to solve this task in 89 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments), but the result was stunning (Fig. 3).

&#x200B;

[Fig. 3: An ant simulation in Python using Pygame developed by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The ants \(black dots\) leave a scent trail as they move \(light grey\).](https://preview.redd.it/yup6wi5ub1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=69bc30a180cd09b81eae3b9e4a3e5807acb7dc3f)

Of course, programming is more than just formulating correct commands in a given programming language: Programs should be designed to be clear and maintainable. A whole discipline (software engineering) deals with the proper design of software. Today, object-oriented programming is by far the most widely used concept for structuring programs. Don't think that ChatGPT wrote some [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). On the contrary, the ant simulation was based on an arbitrarily extensible ant class (classes are a basic concept in object-oriented programming).

I think it's becoming clear what we're dealing with here: ChatGPT is a giant step towards a completely new way of developing software. While until recently a programmer had to strictly follow the rules and syntax of programming languages, ChatGPT allows you to convert plain English into computer programs. This will make it exponentially faster and cheaper to implement new ideas. Programmers will be able to work with breathtaking efficiency and will be able to focus more on other tasks, such as optimization, since large parts of the software can be written automatically.

# OpenAI's Technology Puts Microsoft in Pole Position

Microsoft (MSFT) invested [$1 billion in OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/) in 2019, without disclosing its stake in the company. Considering OpenAI's advanced technology, it was a brilliant move. A year earlier, Microsoft [acquired Github](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) for $7.5 billion. You can think of [Github](https://github.com/) as a giant ""database"" of source code, which of course can be used to train AI. Microsoft has already built its own AI application using [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) and trained it with the ""billions of lines of code"" stored in Github repositories: [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), which was announced in 2021 and released in 2022 as a plug-in for Microsoft's own Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) or others such as Jetbrains IDEs. Once installed, Github Copilot integrates intuitively into a programmer's workflow: she simply needs to write a desired functionality as a natural language comment in a program's source code, and Copilot will automatically generate code accordingly. As if that weren't impressive enough, Copilot learns and adapts to a programmer's unique style. While ChatGPT is not yet monetized, Github Copilot is already available as a paid service for both individuals and [businesses](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business). Using OpenAI's technology to enhance Github Copilot is the next logical step, which is another reason why it shouldn't surprise anyone that Microsoft is reportedly planning another [$10 billion investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html) in ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI.

With the launch of Github Copilot for Business, Microsoft offers a B2B solution for automated code generation. Considering the global shortage of skilled programmers and the current cost-cutting and layoffs in the tech industry, automated code generation is an attractive way to increase efficiency. This creates a whole new market for Microsoft.

It should be mentioned here that AI code generation also raises new copyright issues. The first [copyright lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data) was filed against Microsoft, OpenAI and Github in November 2022. Since every AI model currently in existence must ultimately be trained with pre-existing human-written code, this could result in copyright problems. On the other hand, there is a huge amount of open source code available under very permissive licenses that can be used to train an AI. Moreover, the same problem exists with human-written code. There is a running joke among developers that programming consists mainly of assembling code snippets from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a very popular site for solving programming problems). Every new disruptive technology raises fundamental ethical and legal questions. I doubt that technological progress can be stopped in the long run, even if there is a risk here in the short to medium term.

# What about Alphabet?

While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) continues to develop its own AI code generator away from the public eye. That doesn't mean Alphabet doesn't have advanced algorithms up its sleeve. In 2014, [Alphabet/Google acquired DeepMind](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind), one of the market leaders in artificial intelligence at that time. In December 2022, DeepMind researchers published their progress in developing AI code generation and made the [cover of the prestigious journal *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158). DeepMind's AI AlphaCode reached the top 54.3% in programming competitions. It should be noted that this paper was submitted in April 2022, so the presented results reflect the state of development at least about 9 months ago.

AlphaCode solved competitive tasks on the Codeforces platform, which are posed in longer texts (Fig. 4), and produced better results than 54.3% of human participants. If we assume that rather experienced programmers participate in such contests, this result is overwhelming.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 4: DeepMind's AlphaCode in action solving the \\""Running for Gold\\"" problem. The expression that AlphaCode is currently focusing on are highlighted. \(https:\/\/alphacode.deepmind.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhxzrcq5c1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c57623df7029b01caa4000463f38c10a991a9fb)

To compare AlphaCode with ChatGPT, I asked ChatGPT if it could find a solution to the ""Running for Gold"" problem in C++ (Fig. 4.). ChatGPT immediately found a solution - a correct one as far as I could test it. However, I do not know if ChatGPT has seen this exact problem and solution before during its training.

While AlphaCode's ability to solve algorithmic problems is impressive, the majority of programmers' daily work does not involve creating fancy algorithms. Today's mobile or web apps are mostly built using open source libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), where a lot of functionality is already built in and does not need to be written from scratch. Github Copilot has been trained on huge amounts of source code from applications using these libraries and is already fluent in them.

# Microsoft's Bing is Unlikely to Challenge Google Search in the Short Term

Microsoft is reportedly planning to use the technology behind [ChatGPT to improve its Bing search engine](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-working-on-chatgpt-powered-bing-in-challenge-to-google?irclickid=14syV4RjKxyNWT9W9ywHf2h8UkAwMeVfcQCh3A0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&utm_term=businessinsider.com). Given the popularity of ChatGPT, this would be a major attack on Alphabet's Google Search, but I would be cautious here. A single dialog with ChatGPT currently causes compute costs in the [single-digit cents range](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599671496636780546). OpenAI founder Sam Altman recently called the computational cost ""[eye-watering](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665)"". Using ChatGPT to improve Bing may be a way to create a great search engine, but probably not a profitable one. With Google Search, Alphabet operates a search engine of unparalleled scale. It is questionable whether Microsoft could scale ChatGPT and make this technology available for every search query on Bing at the scale that Google Search is used in the short term. And in the long run, I expect Alphabet to be able to build a comparable transformer-based neural network model into Google Search.

# Microsoft Has Just Begun to Integrate OpenAI's Technology Into Its Ecosystem

In October 2022, Microsoft announced that it would integrate OpenAI's [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) image generator into its new [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) app. Just as ChatGPT can translate plain English into source code, DALL-E 2 can translate plain English into images. The results are impressive, there seem to be no limits to digitally depict the human imagination. In addition, you can have your own images processed by DALL-E 2 using the [Outpainting](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting/) feature. In the long run, Microsoft could attack even Adobe products like Photoshop with its Designer. If you think about it, there is hardly any software in Microsoft's ecosystem that could not be revolutionized by OpenAI's technology. Out there are now countless good text editors, presentation editors, and spreadsheet programs, many of them open source. Aside from cosmetic changes, the development of these ubiquitous tools has stagnated in recent years, and Microsoft has been able to maintain its market position only through its sheer size. With OpenAI's technology, Microsoft could once again make its software unrivaled, as it last did in the 1990s. Imagine Microsoft Outlook responding to your emails with a short command, Microsoft Word autocompleting your text ideas, and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations magically coming together. The technology is there, or as William Gibson once said: ""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.""

# Conclusion

Considering the future possibilities of AI code generation, Microsoft's acquisition of Github and its investment in OpenAI has put the company in a superior position. While Alphabet's AI code generation models are still in the research phase, OpenAI's technology has long left the ivory tower and is already available as a commercial plugin for Microsoft's widely used Visual Studio IDE via Github Copilot. In addition, OpenAI's technology will allow Microsoft to improve every niche of its software ecosystem and provide unrivaled services after years of stagnation. On the other hand, I don't currently see Google Search threatened by an integration of OpenAI's technology into Microsoft's Bing, given the wide technological moats, e.g. in terms of scaling.

Even though Microsoft is currently ahead of the game in AI text and code generation and OpenAI has already developed products to market, while Alphabet is still holding back on its AI technology, I doubt that Alphabet won't have the capabilities to catch up in the foreseeable future. If I had to choose between investing in either company, I would currently prefer Microsoft, but at its current valuation Alphabet is also a fantastic investment. So I have long positions in both companies.

It’s a label the company lost a long time ago after a series of small startups grew to become Microsoft’s biggest competitors. Google, for example, started out as a nimble, innovative upstart and eventually bested Microsoft in browsers, email, and mobile operating systems. But now Microsoft might be the nimble, innovative company that bests Google in artificial intelligence. And it’s all thanks to OpenAI.

OpenAI is the hottest AI lab out there with one of the buzziest and most exciting products: ChatGPT. And Microsoft is its very good friend. On Monday, the two companies announced that Microsoft was investing $10 billion into OpenAI (that’s on top of the $3 billion Microsoft has given OpenAI since 2019), and Microsoft is rumored to be adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Yeah, that’s right: The much-maligned, little-used Bing might finally become a real competitor to Google’s search.

Following the news of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that ChatGPT is a “potential game changer” for Microsoft, and that the company was “not going to repeat the same mistakes” of missing out on social and mobile that it made two decades ago. Microsoft “is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind,” Ives wrote.

There are parallels here, at least on the surface. Microsoft was once the dominant player in computer technology, with its Windows operating system being used by the vast majority of personal computers and its Internet Explorer browser being used by the vast majority of web surfers. And then it got in trouble with the US government, which sued Microsoft for using its dominant position to unfairly drive out competition and take over the then-nascent browser market by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. The lawsuit tied up Microsoft for years. In that environment, companies like Google emerged, putting out better products that people preferred in an exponentially growing market.

Microsoft still did just fine — it remains one of the most valuable companies in the world and is still more valuable than Google — but it doesn’t have the same consumer-facing cachet it did before. Its enterprise clients drive the vast majority of its revenue, through products like Microsoft 365 and Azure. Google, by contrast, is very visible to and much-used by the general consumer, owning everything from Chrome to Gmail to YouTube. Its main revenue source is the digital ads that consumers see as they navigate the internet, and the majority of them are using Google services while they do it.

But now Google is the company that’s having antitrust issues, facing multiple lawsuits from the federal government and almost every state and territory in the country that target core parts of its business, including one that was filed just yesterday. Those may well clear the way for Microsoft to be the leader in a burgeoning industry with a ton of potential: AI. Companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements in the technology and are now showing it off to the general public, while Google’s competing products are practically nowhere to be found beyond updates on Google’s blog. (Microsoft isn’t entirely in the clear, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently trying to block its massive merger with the gaming company Activision Blizzard, but it’s in a much better position, antitrust-wise.)

That’s not to say that Google doesn’t recognize AI’s potential and increasing importance. It’s been working on AI offerings for years, and has some of the best ones. It acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, before OpenAI even existed. And it developed the Transformer technology that ChatGPT is built on (GPT stands for Generative Prediction Transformer).

But Google has held back on giving them the kind of public demonstration that OpenAI has, saying it wants to ensure that its products are responsible and safe before unleashing them. Not helping matters was a claim from a (now-former) engineer that Google’s chatbot technology, LaMDA, had become sentient. That’s been widely dismissed (and denied by Google), but it underlined how advanced the technology has become. And it showed the risks not of the technology becoming sentient, but of it being so good that people would think it was and start to treat it as such.

Now that ChatGPT is out there, Google has to play catch-up and figure out how it wants to integrate its AI technology into its own offerings. It’s even, reportedly, brought back founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help out. The company also recently published a paper outlining its approach to AI and how important it is for that approach to be responsible (or Google’s definition of responsible, given the lack of government regulations).

“Google is, I think, justified and correct in taking this seriously and taking Microsoft’s bid to use this tech to seriously compete with them in advertising, search engines, and other products,” said Derek Leben, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s business school who focuses on AI ethics. “I think this is a very brilliant move from [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella. This is something that is definitely going to position Microsoft very well.”

But, Leben warned, there remains the question of whether the benefits of these products outweigh their risks — and if rushing them to market to compete will enhance those risks.

“That is indeed the problem with arms races,” he said. “They tend to motivate actors in them to move faster, and accept risks that they otherwise would not have accepted.”

Maybe OpenAI’s technology is a game changer. Maybe it’s just a party trick. Either way, Microsoft’s got it, and a lot of people think it’s amazing. That perception is important. Google now finds itself in a similar position that it helped put Microsoft in two decades ago: hoping it can release something better before it gets passed by.

**Fictional Story :** 

\*Opens door in US office ( March 6, 2023 )

( Investors = Legendary Investors )

&#x200B;

Investors: Hey Des long time no see. Where have you been?

Me:  Didn't I say I was in India?

&#x200B;

Investors: No, we meant. Why didn't you come to the party last Friday night hotel? We all had so much fun. We missed you, man.

Me: Well I was just busy.

&#x200B;

Investors: Busy? What have you been doing behind our backs?

Me: Nothing. I was just watching tv shows and anime that I missed. Thats all. I was really tired.

&#x200B;

Investors: You know that we don't believe you right?

Me: Why would I lie to you guys? I have always been loyal, and honest and have given everything to this company.

&#x200B;

Investors: If you have given everything you wouldn't have made a silly mistake you know. You were wrong about high vix Jan. A lot of clients lost their money.

Me: God! Are you guys going to keep it hanging over my head for the rest of my life? I delivered the Q1 disaster and that was the promise I made in the summer of 2022 report. How would I know that the market was going for a huge sideways pattern back then? Also, I took a winter vacation to attend my sister’s wedding.

&#x200B;

Investors: Nah you were just wrong.

Me: I hate you guys. I am going to the club to meet my friends from the tech space. You guys have fun.

&#x200B;

Investors: Well Des you know we have some information for you. We are planning to use a legendary pattern on Wall street again. Do you want in just like the last time?

Me: But haven't we already used the 7yr one in sept the last yr? Liss Truss had to resign because of that. I think it was the last jutsu in our arsenal. What else pattern there is left?

&#x200B;

Investors: God you and your anime reference. We never get it. Well, things have changed my friend.

Me: What are you guys talking about?

&#x200B;

Investors : \*Shows chart. Well, this is the chart pattern one of our guys drew.

Me : \*looking at the chart. This is impossible. How is this supposed to happen?

&#x200B;

Investors: Well we didn’t say it will happen but there is a slight possibility it may happen. This is an even rarest of all patterns. No one on Wall street knows about it. They are always late to find this kind of thing. This has happened just three times in the entire history of America.

Me: C'mon guys. You promised we would long America after $3200 and then we were supposed to go ATH and analyze things again.

&#x200B;

Investors: You are a simple guy Des. Go enjoy your free time. We will talk more later.

Me: Sigh! Do whatever you guys want. See y’all later. Peace.

&#x200B;

\* Leaving office

Me : ( Should I give Wsb a heads up. Hmm )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Intro :**

Respected Traders and Investors,

A very Good morning to y’all. How are you folks doing? 

&#x200B;

No seriously guys, how are you doing? I really am concerned and I wanted to check up on you so tell me you are fine and you’re **growing vegetables in your garden**. Tell me you don’t have your entire savings in your bank account and have some **cash lying in your corner**. Tell me your portfolio is positioned for **short equities + long bonds + long gold** which can help you fight any kind of environment going forward. Every important detail was discussed in this series. Everything! So if any of you are experiencing a bad time then I am extremely sorry. I cannot help you more than this. I mean the whole purpose of this series is to protect the little guys so that big guys can never screw us. Whatever curve ball they throw at us we can easily survive it together against any of their shenanigans.

&#x200B;

Now you guys might be like: “Calm down friend. **Uninsured depositors** are getting their money back. Everything is just fine. Fed is back to printing days. Take your medicine or change your doctor. We need your calm composure, not your Adderall dosage character”

&#x200B;

Yeah guys I think you’re right. I am not doing great. **I have to quit now**. I get very emotional sometimes seeing my Twitter feed. This positional trading **was really all fun and games until banks start collapsing**. Sometimes I feel like puking tbh. No guys I am not drunk today and neither have I partied hard this Friday night with my bear friends. It’s just that all of my **tech bro’s** were gonna be in huge **trouble** and if going forward **systemic risk** really generates up in the system they **will get laid-off** come later this year.  So it’s just really sad you know. But then there are my **finance bro’s** as well who don’t want uninsured depositors over 250K to have their money back. They are saying why they even put money in SVB in the first place. **Why didn’t they do research?** So I am still kinda confused tbh and my head spinning. **I don't know who is right or wrong**. But one thing we can all agree on is at least there shouldn’t be any buyout for equity and bondholders in the banks. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So moving forward :

It’s been more than two weeks since I last posted my two **“Dragon King Newsletters”.** I am seriously regretting my decision now. Why did I ever post them in the first place? I was really afraid and scared of what I saw back then, a **technical storm** was brewing up **in the forex market and especially the bond market** which eventually I feared **would spread across the stock market** and other kinds of global markets as well. Look around you now. All of this really impacted people’s daily lives. **Forensic experts in economics, the stock market** and people who hold high positions in our society were all over the place, be it on Twitter, Youtube, and Reddit asking questions and trying to **examine the problem through the lenses of financial and tech** perspectives. Everyone on the street has his/her opinion and talks about how **no one saw it coming this early**. The key word is this early. 

&#x200B;

Now some of you might be wondering “Dude you saw it all happening in Q1 back in the summer of 2022. You were not right about high vix Jan but you were definitely right about something by the end of march 2023 i.e. **Q1 disaster**. You totally predicted all of this.” 

&#x200B;

No guys if I am being honest I did not foresee this. Yeah, it’s completely true this is not the kind of event I foresaw. I saw another **multiple compression ( 16 PE ) meets a low EPS (210-200)**, a basic principle leg down when yields shoot higher. This was not a multiple compression, this was going to be a freakin **flight to safety** trade for the **Banking crisis recession**. This could have easily turned into a **Black swan** kind of event. All of this shouldn’t be happening right now this early in 1H 2023. This playbook was to be deployed in the 2H of 2023.

&#x200B;

Those who don’t know what I saw have to **go back and read** those newsletters titled **S02E06 and S02E07** when 10yr bond yields were trading around 3.36%. **People** back then **were saying**  “Hey we have a **new bull market**” “**No recession**”  “**Soft** landing” “**No** landing” blah blah. They even said historically low “**equity risk premium**” doesn’t mean anything and they have been saying “**Yield curve inversion**” doesn't mean anything either for the last 1 yr coz conventional wisdom would say resteepening of the std yield curve above 0% causes recession. What else they said oh yeah bond yields higher than the s&p500 yield doesn't mean anything either. And then they always kept repeating buy stocks coz no one can time the market. **Time in the market matters more than timing the markets**. And the famous one of all ""**Everything is priced in already**. Even JP Morgan's collapse tomorrow will be priced in. **The market** is always **forward-looking** and is so **efficient**"" 

&#x200B;

What a fucking BS this all is. We have been **fed lies by everyone** in the last couple of months. And if it was not for the Fed and Treasury which meets every week with the top 4 banks this crisis would have resulted in a Black Monday selloff. Btw the market hasn’t opened yet and I still have some time before I complete this letter. So I gotta hurry. 

&#x200B;

Now I will just stop ranting and move on to the analysis we will be doing here today. I am sure many of you are smart enough to figure out what. No, I am not going to talk about what everyone on Twitter is talking. I mean you guys don’t come here for things that everyone else knows. You guys come here to get my unique perspective on the financial market and how I see it going from here. That’s what we do here. We will leave the forensics to SEC, Govt, Treasury,  Fed, and every Economist on Twitter and Yt. That’s just not how we roll.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Understanding Banking Crisis : 

&#x200B;

There have been many banking crisis ( on top of the recession ) in America’s history but you have to understand that Dow Jones only go as far as 26 May 1896. That means the models you will be creating for your organizations and your clients will not take into account many banking crisis before that. So in layman's terms, the industry std is basically a -50% drop in a recession with a banking crisis on top of it. A normal recession will always be -30% but a deep recession goes -37% on avg meanwhile a shallow one is -25%.

&#x200B;

So let’s first verify this statement of a -50% drop in a recession involving a banking crisis. 

&#x200B;

1907 : 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwbrs23wogna1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97ce0e4a9a214632af9712b684097cd41e4f98f7

Theory : 

&#x200B;

>The Panic of 1907, also known as the Knickerbocker Crisis, was a financial crisis that occurred in the United States in 1907. The crisis began in October of that year and lasted until early November. The panic was caused by a number of factors, including the failure of several banks and trust companies, a run on the banks by depositors, and a shortage of cash reserves.  
>  
>  
>  
>One of the main causes of the crisis was the overexpansion of credit in the United States. During the years leading up to 1907, there was a boom in the stock market and a period of rapid economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions were eager to lend money to businesses and investors, which led to a surge in credit. However, this expansion of credit was unsustainable, and when the economy slowed down, many borrowers were unable to repay their loans.  
>  
>  
>  
>Another factor that contributed to the crisis was the proliferation of trust companies. Trust companies were similar to banks in that they accepted deposits and made loans, but they were not subject to the same regulations as banks. As a result, many trust companies engaged in risky lending practices, which left them vulnerable to financial shocks.  
>  
>  
>  
>The crisis began on October 21, 1907, when the Knickerbocker Trust Company, one of the largest trust companies in New York City, announced that it was insolvent. This caused panic among depositors, who rushed to withdraw their money from other banks and trust companies. This, in turn, led to a shortage of cash reserves, which made it difficult for banks to meet the demand for withdrawals.  
>  
>  
>  
>To prevent the crisis from spreading further, a group of bankers, led by J.P. Morgan, intervened. They provided loans to struggling banks and trust companies and persuaded other bankers to do the same. They also organized a consortium of banks, known as the Clearing House Association, which agreed to lend money to any member bank that was in need.  
>  
>  
>  
>Through these actions, the bankers were able to restore confidence in the financial system, and the crisis began to subside. However, the crisis had a significant impact on the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose. The crisis also led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  
>  
>  
>  
>In conclusion, the 1907 banking crisis in America was caused by a combination of factors, including overexpansion of credit, risky lending practices, and the proliferation of unregulated trust companies. The crisis led to a run on the banks and a shortage of cash reserves, which threatened to spread throughout the financial system. However, the crisis was ultimately contained by the intervention of a group of bankers, who provided loans and restored confidence in the system. The crisis had a significant impact on the economy and led to increased scrutiny of the banking system, which ultimately led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.

Technicals :

Now that we know a little about the Panic of 1907 from our friend AI. It’s time to observe it through the lens of technicals. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ff73zrlbpgna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23839bf996be8561913e4e270ce8420497fd7233

&#x200B;

What we can observe here is recession was about to have a -26.81% drop and then we were supposed to have a new bull market after bouncing from 200wMA but then because of the banking crisis on top of it the drop was almost -50%. The exact number would be -48.54%. So how do we identify when the banking crisis will hit on top of the recession? Well, look no further than 200wMA in DJI. When price action comes visit it 2nd time you need to remember it acts like a quick sand and then you know you are going to have dark ages all over again. Now it’s entirely up to you if you chose to fight the dark ages or not with the help of flip-flopping Federal Reserve behind your back. 

&#x200B;

To summarize if you observe the recession drop was -26.81% ( wave 1 down ) and then another -28.16% ( wave 5 down ) for the banking crisis. The overall drop was = -48.54%. Wave 2 to 3 of -18.56% was just a confirmation wave that we are going to have a banking crisis. Easy peasy right.

Theory :

&#x200B;

>The 1929-1932 banking crisis, also known as the Great Depression, was a severe economic downturn that occurred in the United States and other parts of the world during the 1930s. The crisis was triggered by the stock market crash of 1929, which led to a sharp decline in economic activity and widespread unemployment.

>The stock market crash of 1929 marked the beginning of the crisis. The crash was caused by a number of factors, including overvaluation of stocks, excessive speculation, and a decline in consumer spending. The crash led to a panic among investors, who rushed to sell their shares, which caused stock prices to plummet.  
>  
>  
>  
>The decline in stock prices had a ripple effect throughout the economy. Many businesses were forced to close, and unemployment rose sharply. This, in turn, led to a wave of bank failures, as businesses and individuals were unable to repay their loans.

Technicals :

Now that we know about the Banking crisis of the Great Depression with the help of our AI friend. Let’s look at technicals, shall we? Don't be scared.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l0h4vj5dqgna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba6f59a9eae7983dd8c51efd9101e69c7c976ba2

I am sure many guys on Twitter or Reddit or Youtube have already bored you with this pattern which totally looks like a period from 2000-2022. But these folks have no clue how to use it. Allow me to show you how. Just like the prev pattern we had a -46.20% drop for recession. The reason we had the drop this much was due to the fact that it was a gigantic super-bubble. That’s why it was 2x amplified. So you have to divide everything by 2. Hence 23.10% seems fair for a drop till 200wMA i.e a recessionary drop. Then again we had a rally up which btw in the textbook is called back to normal. It was only a few months later that we realized “oh uh” there is going to be a banking crisis on top of it. Hence the stock market came to test 200wMA a second time. Just like prev 1907 times the MA acted like quicksand. Hence initiated the financial crisis drop on top of it in wave 5. The overall drop had to be -45 to -50% but it was amplified by a factor of 2 hence the drop was almost -90%.

Theory : 

&#x200B;

>The 2008 banking crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis, was a severe economic downturn that began in the United States and quickly spread throughout the world. The crisis was triggered by a number of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments.  
>  
>The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the widespread issuance of subprime mortgages to borrowers who were unlikely to be able to repay them. These mortgages were then packaged together and sold as securities to investors, many of whom were not aware of the risks involved. When many of these borrowers defaulted on their loans, the value of these securities plummeted, which led to a crisis in the financial markets.  
>  
>The securitization of mortgages and the use of complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs), also contributed to the crisis. These instruments were used to spread the risk of default across multiple parties, but they were often poorly understood and underregulated, which led to a systemic breakdown in the financial system.  
>  
>The crisis began in the US housing market but quickly spread to other parts of the economy. Many large financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG, were heavily exposed to these complex financial instruments and suffered massive losses as a result. As these institutions began to fail, there was a panic among investors and depositors, which led to a shortage of liquidity in the financial system.  
>  
>To address the crisis, the US government and other governments around the world implemented a number of measures. The US government passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided funds to troubled financial institutions in exchange for equity stakes. The Federal Reserve System implemented a number of monetary policies aimed at increasing the money supply and stabilizing the financial system. Central banks around the world also implemented similar measures.  
>  
>The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy, and many countries experienced a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. The crisis also led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape, with many governments implementing stricter regulations on financial institutions and complex financial instruments.  
>  
>In conclusion, the 2008 banking crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the subprime mortgage crisis, the securitization of mortgages, and the use of complex financial instruments. The crisis had a profound impact on the global economy and led to significant changes in the regulatory landscape. The crisis highlighted the need for better risk management and regulation in the financial sector, and it continues to have an impact on the way that governments and financial institutions approach economic policy.

Technicals: 

It's the same thing happening over here and most of us have probably lived it when we were young. If you were not even born when this was happening I suggest kindly step out of the market. This analysis is just not meant for you 14yr olds.

2022 :  

&#x200B;

Well, let's see how this turns out. But the one thing you guys can expect from this is that the bubble really is not in SPX and DJI. I have been saying this since last summer. It's the Nasdaq that needs to die. Yeah, tech buddies you guys need to go. Tech is a boom-bust cycle of 20yrs. You have to come to terms with this. You just cannot escape your fate. It's just like your crypto buddies who were not able to escape their 4yrs fate. So I humbly request you to kindly give up. You are just overloading the banking system.

&#x200B;

 

**Conclusions** : 

The banking Crisis Recession can be categorized into 5 wave principles. No, I am not trying to do an Elliot wave here. So please advanced technical traders do not get confused.

&#x200B;

Wave 1 : ( 200wMA I )

Recessionary drop.

&#x200B;

Wave 2 :  ( Big Impulse I )

Impulse up i.e. Back to Normal.

&#x200B;

Wave 3 : ( 200wMA II )

Confirmation signal for Banking Crisis coming where the quicksand happens and 200wMA acts like a magnet.

&#x200B;

Wave 4 : ( Short Impulse II )

Small impulse up till 200wMA as resistance.

&#x200B;

Wave 5 : ( Thee final Drop )

The Banking Crisis Unleashed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|Wave 1|Wave 2|Wave 3 |Wave 4|Wave 5|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1907|\-26.81%|\+12.78%|\-18.56%|\+6.70%|\-28.26%|\-48.54%|
|1929|\-49.40%|\+52.16%|\-30.11%|\+19.00%|\-83.59%|\-89.49%|
|2008|\-18.05%|\+12.91%|\-17.58%|\+9.60%|\-45.48%|\-54.43%|
|2022|\-22.44%|\+21.11%|?|?|?|?|
|(1907+2008) /2|\-22.43%||\-18.07%||\-36.87%||
|Average of three prev||||||\-64.15%|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If we are expecting a banking crisis this year then the overall markets should drop greater than -45% but less than -64.15% ( average of three crashes). Do remember that the rough industry std is -50% but if I were to pick a random arbitrary number I would pick :

2022-23 overall DJI drop should be = -51.485% ( avg of 1907 and 2008 )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Result :** 

This pattern will take time to activate. I can attach timestamps to it but I don’t think it would be necessary. All you have to understand is the wave-like price action 12345 and make your own decision on which wave you will trade. I cannot keep helping you guys. It’s about time you learn to catch fish yourself and stop complaining. Positional trading is not everyone’s cup of tea and it requires a lot of patience. Most people don’t have this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Invalidation :** 

Every theory must have an invalidation. This is the one for me. What if we go up from here and only to crash later in Oct 2008? ( Hint: Quadruple Witching of March, Sept Low Liquidity attack which Fed still doesn't understand. )

""Desmond you are a traitor. Why did you sell off $FAZ etf. We were going to crush banks with you. We trusted you man. How could you do this to us""

&#x200B;

Yeah guys I am not interested in crushing banks and hence took profits. I have told you all this before it is my personal vendetta and hence it shouldn't be yours. The question you should be asking is why is SPX short low. Well, folks, I wanted to reduce my position to get a better avg price so that any rallies that may come will be faded using that cash balance. As for bonds yah I sold them to buy more JD, 3x Chinese etf, and some gold miners' stocks. Overall my short position must be in the range of 50-60% now. I haven't calculated it coz I am writing this letter way fast.

P.s. Rumors are circulating around that your trading brokers may go insolvent Ex : Schwab, Robinhood, TD, etc. Now I don't know the full truth about it but I would advise you guys to not go all in with your savings in any broker. When the banking crisis hit you have no idea who is underwater and playing with customers' deposits. Let's just be clear it's just a rumor I heard on Twitter and no way i can prove it.

&#x200B;

Important message :

Many new people don't know that I started this portfolio with $100 in Wall Street Newsletter in the hopes I will turn it into $10,000 in no time without using any options. So basically by predicting all bear market rallies with you guys, it grew $430+. I wish I had access to the US options market but I just don't.

**Closing thoughts :** 

No one really knows what is going to happen. If someone really knows what will happen please do comments down below. I really wanna know your theory going up for 2023. 

But today i am going to tell you a story and maybe you can draw some lessons from it. So the thing is my sister is at a medical university who paid x amt of money until the completion of her 4yrs. The authorities over there are now telling students to pay an additional same x amt more fees during their final internship phase otherwise they would not receive their medical degree. ( Maybe they are underwater in the financial market as well xD ) The message I wanted to convey to you guys from this story is that fraud, corruption and all sorts of dirty things are going to start happening from this yr. You thought scam comments in Yt, Twitter, and Discord were bad you guys have no idea what's in the store. So be vigilant in making any sort of financial decisions. Everyone out there is there to get you when the real austerity begins. If you haven't experienced the ""Legitimate things turning fraud cycle"" yourself then you might not be ready for this.

**Acknowledgment:** 

&#x200B;

I would be lying if I said I have never watched any finance experts in my life. So I would like to thank some people who have been really helpful with their research in helping me throughout my finance journey. 

&#x200B;

* Mike Wilson: Thank you for taking one for the team. Without you capitulating this would have not been possible sir. You really are the best tactical trader that I have ever seen on Bloomberg.
* Katie Stockton: Thanks for always shorting SPX above $3900 since Nov 2nd week. Also thanks to your friend Liss. You two are really the best folks to watch on Cnbc.
* Market Makers: Thank you, sir. I learned some advanced technical from you. These DW kind of indicators really helps me a lot when I try to put my macroeconomic research on top of it.
* Inthemoney: Thank you, man. You have taught people like us trading options and I wish I had taken the advice you gave me personally that the market can go sideways. Learned that the hard way. xD
* Maverick of Wall Street: Thank you for staying in the Stagflation camp man. It was really lonely when everyone was talking about disinflation. Even I panicked and had to hedge using bonds and the funny thing is I still do. Your jokes in the morning really make my day.
* All in Podcast & Weekly startups: If you guys haven’t watched it you sure as hell are missing a lot. No words are enough to describe how awesome these podcasts are. Whatever discussion these guys have becomes the talk of the town for next week. 
* Block works Macro: The lineup these guys come up with is really mind-blowing. My fav ones have always been Lyn, Joseph, and Howell. The hosts of this show are equally amazing as well.
* Meet Kevin: Regardless of what anyone says he is still the most hardworking guy I have ever seen on Yt. The work ethic Kevin has is simply so hard for anyone to match. If you are looking for a daily macro research topic he is the guy to follow.
* Also thanks to the anonymous experienced investors who always try to give me advice like having a backup plan, invalidation cases, and not catching fish for others
* And thank you to everyone from Reddit and Twitter who has ever traded with me. Without you guys, this journey would not have been so successful. I know season 2 sucked in comparison to season 1 just like any other tv show from its highs. I will definitely try to improve more in next season 3 which releases in 2028 or maybe 2029. 
* Last and finally I would like to thank all the Legendary Investors in our space. Without your interviews on YT about finance I would have never learned anything. It's because of you folks that I am always calm and composed while i am investing or trading.

&#x200B;

I guess this is how a goodbye feels like. Sayonara Everyone. We will soon meet again in 2028-29.

54,What I'm doing for PLTR earnings tonight,79,13byuhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/,77,1683567249.0,"Today after-hours, Palantir is reporting latest earnings. Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.

Over the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.

The data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/palantir-expects-2023-be-first-profitable-year-sees-ai-driving-growth-2023-02-13/) 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-expands-microsoft-cloud-computing-pact-to-government-agencies/) of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.

However, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by ""incremental commercial headwinds,"" despite ""resilient"" spending from the federal government.

**What to do for earnings?**

PLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it. Just playing with last week's profits from [AAPL's earning play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) that I posted."

56,The AI productivity trap: how the 'Blockbuster Effect' may hurt your stock investments,72,14hvwyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hvwyv/the_ai_productivity_trap_how_the_blockbuster/,43,1687620829.0,"**Summary**  
While AI presents vast opportunities for enhancing global economic productivity, it is important to acknowledge that not all companies will thrive or even survive in the face of this revolution. However, it appears that investors are presently embracing an overly optimistic outlook, assuming that virtually every company will automatically reap the rewards of this emerging technology.  
We currently live in the so called “knowledge economy”, a system that values intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation as the primary sources of economic value. Knowledge acts as a potent business moat for established companies, making it challenging for competitors to replicate or access. Thus creating a strong barrier to entry in the market.  
The emergence of AI could potentially lead to a ""knowledge democratization"" phenomenon, gradually dismantling the barriers that currently protect business moats, and thereby impacting the valuations of many popular stocks. This effect, which I refer to as the ""Blockbuster effect,"" entails a scenario where a disruptive technology benefits everyone except those who were initially expected to be the primary beneficiaries of such innovations.

  
**The actual post**  
Over the past decades, the concept of the ""knowledge economy"" has gained prominence, emphasizing the significance of knowledge generation, acquisition, and utilization in driving economic growth and development. In this transformed economic landscape, the primary source of value has shifted from traditional factors like raw materials and physical labor to intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation.  
Within this context, knowledge can be viewed as a valuable business moat. It represents a company's unique expertise, insights, or intellectual property that are not easily replicated or acquired by competitors, thereby creating a barrier to entry.  
Smaller companies and startups often face challenges in competing with larger corporations due to limited financial resources. They may struggle to invest in research and development, hire highly skilled professionals, or acquire advanced technologies, which can hinder their ability to develop and leverage knowledge-based assets. In contrast, larger corporations benefit from well-established networks, partnerships with industry leaders, and research institutions, granting them access to valuable knowledge, market insights, and collaborative opportunities. These advantages strengthen their competitive position.  
In my perspective, the modern corporate world is heavily influenced by the monopolization of knowledge. However, AI has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift by democratizing knowledge, which could prove detrimental to many well-established companies. If AI succeeds, it may enable smaller companies to compete with industry leaders in the medium term. In the long term, we might witness a guerrilla war where market leaders contend with numerous small or micro companies.  
In this hypothetical scenario, the global economy becomes highly productive, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, increased productivity does not automatically translate into higher stock valuations, and the opposite may be true for many stocks currently traded. I refer to this phenomenon as the ""Blockbuster effect"" or the ""Blockbusterization"" of the economy, in honor of the defunct video rental company that was essentially rendered obsolete by the internet.  
During the late 1990s, computers and the internet were introduced as transformative technologies that would reshape the corporate landscape and enhance productivity, which indeed happened. The democratization of information brought about significant societal and economic changes. While many existing companies benefited greatly from this revolution, others became redundant or remained as struggling entities awaiting the next downturn.  
Blockbuster serves as a notable example. The internet greatly enhanced the productivity of the entertainment industry, benefiting society at large. However, it also swiftly eradicated Blockbuster's core assets and competitive advantages. For instance, Blockbuster had an extensive network of exclusive movie rental deals with major producers such as Warner Bros., Disney, and Paramount, which ensured early access to popular titles and fostered customer loyalty. However, with the rise of streaming platforms, many of these partners established their own direct channels, rendering Blockbuster's exclusive deals irrelevant. Other once-relevant moats, such as well-located stores and an extensive movie catalog, also lost their significance.  
Blockbuster stock performed quite well during the dot-com bubble and reached its all-time high in early 2002. Investors seemingly believed that Blockbuster could leverage its dominant market position and embrace the wonders of computers and the internet at the core of its business. However, it is unclear why they were so optimistic, considering that Blockbuster primarily served as an intermediary between studios and consumers, lacking distinctiveness beyond physical rentals. Investors seemingly failed to distinguish between the broader societal and economic impacts of technology and its specific implications for their investment.   
While Blockbuster is a prominent example, countless lesser-known companies and entire industries faced similar fates. The internet revolutionized entire layers of intermediaries that existed before personal computers and the internet.  
In my viewpoint, there seems to be a pervasive tendency to haphazardly incorporate the potential productivity gains driven by AI into the valuations of every company. This mirrors the past mistake made by Blockbuster's investors, who assumed that the mere greatness of a new technology for society and the overall economy would guarantee its benefits for their favored stocks or indices.  
Furthermore, it is crucial to delve into related matters that surpass the scope of this discussion. For instance, it is worth examining why there is a widespread belief that the ""Magnificent Seven Stocks"" will inevitably derive substantial benefits from, or even survive, the AI revolution. Additionally, one should consider the possibility that the true victors of the AI revolution have yet to emerge, transcending existing players in the market.

  
**My advice for the future**  
Right now we are getting bombarded with AI hype, FOMO and 90s like irrational exuberance, my advice can be summed up as follows.    
1-Exercise prudence when factoring in prospective productivity improvements into the current market leaders. This task is intricate and carries a considerable risk of filling your portfolio with overvalued stocks.  
2-Maintain an open-minded approach, acknowledging the possibility that many present-day market leaders could face redundancy or obsolescence in the medium or even near future, despite the overall stability of the economy and markets.   
3-Don't let AI distract you from important macroeconomic trends happening in the present hoping the irruption of AI changes it all. Same happened in the dot com era, people talked about this “new era” where even basic stuff like P/E ratios or the yield curve inversion were no longer relevant, but it was. God knows it was. "
57,"Google joined, the AI war officially started!",77,10vvu36,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10vvu36/google_joined_the_ai_war_officially_started/,53,1675754845.0,"Seeing that Microsoft's AI business is skyrocketing on the basis of ChatGPT, Google finally joined the battle in. Anthropic, a start-up company that invests in ChatGPT's competing products, is only the first step, and Bard, a chat robot based on a large-scale language model LaMDA developed by Google itself, has become the key to victory.

 There is no doubt that Google, as a pioneer in AI technology, is the best in terms of technology.  Bard can use Google's huge information base to provide users with accurate and high-quality answers, posing a powerful threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.

 Under the pressure of rivals, Google accelerates the progress of the AI   war

Faced with the pressing of rivals, Google has invested about US$300 million in Anthropic, an AI start-up, and acquired about 10% of Anthropic's shares. The latter will use the investment to purchase a large amount of computing resources from Google's cloud computing department.

 And Google has begun to accelerate the speed of research and development in this AI war.  According to media reports, Google executives have recently accelerated the review and release of AI projects, and at the same time assigned a team of engineers to carry out new research and development projects to integrate new results into core search and other fields.

 On Monday, February 6, Eastern Time, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, published a blog post announcing that in 2021, Google will begin the development of conversational AI services supported by the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA). Today, LaMDA-driven  Bard will be open to trusted beta testers and is preparing to become more widely available to the public ""in the coming weeks.""

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Monday that it will help developers use AI innovation.  In his blog post, he revealed that next month and March this year, Google's generative language application program port (API) will be opened to enterprises, developers and creators, allowing developers to use Google's language model to build their own apps.

&#x200B;

 This is also the latest decision made by Google under pressure from investors.

Already a step ahead, Microsoft has previously announced that it plans to hold an event on Tuesday to announce that ""a number of exciting projects have progressed,"" which is expected to include a version of Bing that includes a chatbot.

The move has sparked dissatisfaction among Google investors, who believe that compared with rivals, Google has not moved quickly enough to release internal AI tools.  As a technological pioneer of tools such as ChatGPT, Google has not given full play to its own advantages, which even aroused dissatisfaction among researchers within the company.

However, in response to the previous research and development progress, Google executives said that the speed of developing their own chatbots is not slow, and they have adopted a very cautious attitude in the process.  They see this as a contrast to competing ChatGPT, which fabricates information based on user queries.

 Executives also stressed that they must test new tools to ensure they provide objective information and prevent misuse of information.

Pichai also said on Monday:

 It's important that we bring the experiences rooted in these models to the world in bold and responsible ways...that's why we're committed to developing AI technologies responsibly.

Google Has Tech Advantage LaMDA Is Considered 'Human Sensitive'

Google, which has pioneered AI technology, has a large technological lead.

 LaMDA developed by Google is a large-scale language model trained on billions of words on the Internet.  It not only benefits from Google's stronger computing power and R&D team, but also Google's ability to fine-tune the LaMDA model and chatbot Bard through feedback from millions of users.  According to Pichai, Bard can use Google's huge information base to provide users with accurate and high-quality answers, posing a powerful threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.  


It is also worth noting that whether this technology is applicable to the business models of large search platforms is still unknown.

 Chatbots such as ChatGPT could reshape internet search with brilliant answers to a single question, but that doesn't fit the way Google makes money on a search platform.  Google has built a $150 billion search empire over the years through users clicking on ads and links, yet searches for a single question can cause clicks to plummet."
58,"Earning plays for CRWD, CRM, AI, OKTA, and JWN",66,13wrcad,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13wrcad/earning_plays_for_crwd_crm_ai_okta_and_jwn/,115,1685551441.0,"*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. 

Starting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.

CrowdStrike’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD’s products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.

Stellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter’s top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.

Moreover, CrowdStrike’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products’ availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter bottom line.

Next is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company’s guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% gain.

Similarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company’s outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.

Salesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.

The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.

Salesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.

Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.

However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.

On May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  

Rangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce’s quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.

Despite that, Rangan noted, “As a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.” Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.

I know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?

C3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company’s fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.

C3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.

With its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Aside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company’s $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company’s business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.

Those initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, ""Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.” The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.

For the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.

The company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there’s a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.

As noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.

The Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company’s consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock’s near-term direction.

Strong demand for the company’s Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.

**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.

The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.

Okta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products’ ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.

Demand for the company’s solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.

However, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.

Finally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.

Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.

In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.

Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

**So what to do for earnings?**

Just to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA. And I'm getting puts on JWN. I don't expect all of them to hit, I just like to throw my money on the table and see what flies. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice."

U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.

The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.

With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers said the Fed is coming to the end of interest rate hikes after a series of weak economic indicators were released and the possibility of a U.S. recession is on the rise. Commenting on the Fed's May rate meeting, Summers said it is clear that we are in the final stages of the current tightening cycle. Whether it is necessary to take action again, I think this is a judgment they should wait until the last minute.

**Hedge funds: the Fed policy is about to turn, the dollar may depreciate 15% in a year and a half**

British hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital released a report saying that the dollar could fall another 10 to 15 percent in the next year and a half as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve is about to ease monetary policy. Stephen Jen, the firm's chief executive, said the Fed may be very close to or may even have crossed the peak of its hawkish stance, and that means a rate cut is coming.

**Bank of America: How OPEC + Production Cuts Impacted April CPI Data**

Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains. 

**Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**

Despite the ongoing crisis in the U.S. banking sector, the market still has doubts about the outlook for the banking sector and the U.S. economy, but U.S. retail investors continued to plunge into hard-hit bank stocks in the first quarter, pumping money into heavyweight stocks such as U.S. banks. According to data from Vanda Research, net buying of U.S. bank stocks soared to $769 million in the first quarter of this year, surpassing even the buying of retail concepts such as $Nifty ([NFLX.US](https://NFLX.US))$ and $Rivian Automotive ([RIVN.US](https://RIVN.US))$ in the same period.

65,Microsoft Q3 Earnings - Room for improvement,49,135m5t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/135m5t5/microsoft_q3_earnings_room_for_improvement/,6,1683036276.0,"Microsoft surpassed everyone’s expectations with their latest Q3’23 earnings, by beating estimates on their top line revenue and bottom-line net income. Although their growth rates for azured has slowed to 27% from 31%, the growth rate was still better than expectation. Nevertheless, the CEO Satya Nadella has whetted investors’ appetite during the earnings call by announcing the phase of growth for azure, which is Azure OpenAI. With the success of ChatGPT around the world, businesses are excited on the introduction of the Azure OpenAI, which would lead to further revenue growth for Microsoft.

AI-Integration of their product offerings has kept the growth story strong for Microsoft. Prior to their quarterly earnings release, shareholders were worried that Microsoft’s growth would come to a halt, and that this would sink the share price given that they are still currently priced to grow at double digits for years to come. Through this quarter earnings, Microsoft has proved that they are able to integrated AI to their current product offering successfully.

While Microsoft has produced a stellar quarter, there is still some room for improvement due to the share buybacks and dividend increase not keeping up with their growth. While it is debatable that they are increasing their R&D spend for AI, Microsoft has been generating lots of free cash flow, and they can look into providing shareholder value through higher share buybacks or increasing their dividends.

66,Morgan Stanley Taps ChatGPT’s Maker to Build AI System for Advisors,51,11sf3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11sf3ek/morgan_stanley_taps_chatgpts_maker_to_build_ai/,3,1678927816.0,"https://www.barrons.com/amp/advisor/articles/morgan-stanley-chatgpt-open-ai-artificial-intelligence-advisors-377b072f

Morgan Stanley is working with OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, to develop an artificial intelligence resource for its financial advisors.

Morgan Stanley describes the planned technology as an “internal-facing service” that will mine the company’s in-house content—research reports, analyst notes, comparative asset models, etc.—to help advisors better serve their clients.

Jeff McMillan, head of analytics, data, and innovation at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, says the firm had evaluated hundreds of start-ups and technology vendors to develop an artificial intelligence product that at once benefits advisors and improves the client experience while also adhering to compliance requirements.

Among all those considered, “OpenAI stands out,” McMillan says in a statement.

“The work we are doing with them will allow us to bring our expansive intellectual capital into the hands of our financial advisors in seconds,” he says. “It will be like having our chief investment strategist, chief global economist, and global equities strategist on call for every financial advisor 24/7.”

The application positions Morgan Stanley as an early adopter of GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s language software. Morgan Stanley says it is the only company in wealth management working with OpenAI to receive early access to its products.

The technology is currently in testing with Morgan Stanley advisors, with a full rollout planned for late spring or early summer, McMillan tells Barron’s Advisor.

The artificial intelligence application, which Morgan Stanley has yet to name, draws exclusively on the firm’s own materials, meaning that it’s cordoned off from the public internet.

But Morgan Stanley’s own body of content is vast. The company expects the new AI application to help advisors to quickly find the most relevant materials to produce better recommendations for clients.

“It allows advisors to instantaneously source and analyze our intellectual capital in ways that would have historically been quite time consuming,” McMillan says. “It’s essentially like having the smartest experts at Morgan Stanley on speed dial.”

So how would the AI tool help advisors in practice? McMillan offers a few examples. An advisor might ask it how best to explain to clients the difference between an earnings recession and an economic recession. More basically, an advisor might ask the program what a Morgan Stanley analyst’s outlook is for the S&P 500, and why.

Other potential queries, per McMillan:

“What are Morgan Stanley’s rates on CDs and what are some alternative products available to my clients who are seeking yield?”

“Tell me the top-rated technology stocks by our research department, and compare and contrast the risk and reward for each.”

Morgan Stanley puts any new technology through rigorous compliance testing before rolling it out widely across the firm, and the AI application is no different. Morgan Stanley is developing its AI application in concert with the firm’s legal, risk, and compliance teams to incorporate “appropriate safeguards and controls,” McMillan says.

There isn’t a client-facing side to the new technology, which McMillan describes as “an internal research tool for our advisors,” though it is very much intended to directly inform their work with clients.

“[T]o be clear,” he says, “this is designed to help our advisors more efficiently and intelligently communicate with their clients, so it is involved with client interactions, albeit through our advisors.”"

But according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Microsoft remains the stock to buy as it maintains its lead in AI with its stake in ChatGPT and prepares to start monetizing the opportunity.

""The AI monetization opportunity makes us more bullish on \[Microsoft\],"" he said in a Thursday note. ""We believe that Microsoft is in a unique position to gain share in the cloud market while deploying additional AI capabilities that we estimate could expand Redmond's total addressable market around cloud by 35% to 40% over the coming years.""

The company's strategic stake in ChatGPT, which was bolstered earlier this year with an additional $10 billion investment into OpenAI, could set Microsoft up for the opportunity to start taking share in the cloud space from Amazon's AWS offering. 

Ives reiterated his ""Outperform"" rating on Microsoft and said it remains a ""best idea."" Additionally, he increased his price target on Microsoft to $340 from $325, representing potential upside of 9% from current levels.

While Alphabet continues to play catchup in the AI space, it is setting up to go head-to-head for market share against Microsoft, especially as the search company has indicated that it plans to incorporate AI capabilities into all aspects of its product suite, including the cloud.

The report will cover the quarter from January 2023 to March 2023.

**Microsoft Earnings Expectation**

Revenues: $51.05 billion. 4% year-over-year growth but 4% lower than the previous quarter.

EPS: $2.23, no change from a year ago and 3.8% lower than Q2.

**What to watch for**

Out of the three business divisions, the Intelligent Cloud department has become Microsoft’s gold mine nowadays, contributing 40% of the group’s total revenue with sound and solid growth momentum. In the previous quarter, the cloud services’ revenue increased 18% while whole group’s revenue only added 2%.

For the to-be-reported quarterly earnings, Microsoft anticipated revenues from the Intelligent Cloud will keep increasing at the pace between 17% and 19% to a range of $21.7-$22 billion. However, Microsoft also flagged that Azure, the cloud computing platform that which is one of the main engines of the cloud business, would slow down its growing speed by 4 or 5 percentage points to near 30% in the fiscal third quarter, down from 46% in the same period last year.

Q2 FY23 Financial Summary: https://i.imgur.com/zNmvSEH.png

**The laggard**

The downtrend in the global personal computing industry has accelerated in the past year. So did Microsoft’s PC business. In the six months ended December 31th, the revenue from the PC related business was down 11% YOY, while in the last three month, the yearly downfall rate was speed up to 19%.

The first quarter of this year has marked the fifth consecutive quarter of global PC sales decline. As such, it's not difficult to see that this hard-to-stop slide will further falter the demand for all the product line under the umbrella of Personal Computing. The used-to-be-proud King of the PC projected this sector's revenue for Q3 will be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, indicating a 14%-17% decline from the same quarter last year.

https://i.imgur.com/oz4yDzf.png

**The AI Race**

The battlefield for the AI race has been set up and the smoke is getting intense.

Microsoft seemly led the way for now thanks to its shared commitment with OpenAI to build generative AI systems--ChatGPT has convinced the world in 2023 that, AI will become a topping layer of technology and prompt a new generation of “platform shift”.

Clearly, all the tech giants are not hesitated to go all-in in the AI race and are ready to thrive in this new age. Microsoft, despite racing inches ahead now, is facing the fiercest competition in decades. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, unveiled a similar AI function in March for Gmail, which is now used by 1.8 billion people around the world. Apple disclosed that 45% of its M&A targets are AI-related compared to Microsoft’s 23% now. In terms of the bright minds, Meta has employed 23.5% of staff with AI skills while Microsoft’s ratio is 21.8%

Additionally, the ticket to the AI race is very costly. Microsoft has boosted its R&D investment in the previous quarter by 18% to 6.8 billion, which, saw its net margin fell from 36% to 30% in the September quarter.

As Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella said in January: “The next major wave of computing is being born.” Microsoft is not shy with its ambition to be the king of the new wave, the challenge being, all its old foes are thinking the same.

**Microsoft Share Price**

Despite the bright limelight this year thanks to ChatGPT, Microsoft’s stock price didn’t enjoy extra shine compared to other tech titans. But the good news is the price has clearly bottomed out from the Nov-Jan low when the two-year-low was made.

Based on the weekly chat, the stock is currently attempting to challenge the August peak at around 291-296, a hurdle that could open the door to $300 psychological level if successfully conquered.

Conversely, if the break fails, any pullback should be supported by the 100-MA to preserve the bull-biased momentum. However, a fall below this level will risk further breaching the current ascending trajectory and increase the chance of a bear-reversal.

But the recent price movements are not going to play a role in whether it goes up or down tonight. I believe it would be smart to get calls for earnings. I think a MSFT call spread would be good. Buy the 4/28 280c and sell the 290c, which would cost about $277. You could be leaving with 3.6x gains if this goes well!"

**May 27th Recap**

The stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.

This positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.

As a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.

# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day

As the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.

The day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.

At 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.

Lastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.

On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.

72,MSFT is baking in massive AI revenue streams. Is it really going to boost profits like the hype?,43,13vuikf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13vuikf/msft_is_baking_in_massive_ai_revenue_streams_is/,78,1685463220.0,"Long term holder of MSFT here. To be fair I think MSFT is making a good move getting out in front of this trend and getting a big foothold in the industry. However cool the tech is I find it very hard to believe the stock run up is warranted to this level based on what I saw at build. Couple of points I think ""bear"" considering.

1. How many employers are going to pay extra for these features is the near future? My company has blocked most things AI citing fears of client data leaks and misuse. (co-piot, bing chat)
2. How big of a revenue boost will this really be? There is a lot of computational hardware in use behind the scenes. If you have power users hitting this all day how much is being kept in profit?
3. Azure Open AI seems to have some good use cases, but a lot of the demonstrated cases are around chat bots. Are chat bots worth a 35X + multiplier on this 2 trillion plus stock?

My view is more that MSFT has to do this to ensure they stay in the game not that this will be a major major revenue driver. For a company this large thinking PE of 35 is a bit lofty. But then again I've been reminded by some that MR Market tends to throw fundamentals to the wind when the hype gets big and we can grow into this multiplier...it just might be a bit."

## A Tantalizing Treatise on The Tastiest Crayons in Trade 🖍️

Once upon a midnight dreary, the market whispered, weak and weary,
Of technical analysis and indicators, oh so eerie,
To predict the price levels of today, based on the past,
A tale of options, greeks, and the stock market's vast.

In this macabre analysis of option open interest, we see,
Calculations of portfolio-level greeks, Delta and Gamma, with glee,
Simulating changes at different price points, as if by a ghostly hand,
Discovering where gamma is high, and delta near zero, like a raven in the sand.

Some tickers, like spirits in the night, react strongly, it's true,
Off delta neutral, gamma max, or both, a spectral brew,
It is these reactions from the past, that drive our trading signals,
Like a pendulum swinging, or the beating heart beneath the floorboards, it jiggles.

## A Peculiar Parchment of Notes - Wrinkling Your Brain 🧠

* If the price has soared past the entry, beware the cryptic change,
  Between the time these plays were conjured and market open's strange.
* Sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest,
  Like a premature burial, exit at your discretion, lest you be distressed.
* Risk up to 1% of your capital, like a black cat's cautious prowl,
  With less conviction, allocate less, and dollar cost average, like a wise old owl.
* Trades calculated before market open, based on yesterday's gloom,
  Keep in mind, new price movements may invalidate the original doom.

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Have More Flavor Than Your Wardrobe 🎨

Darlings, technical analysis and indicator-based trading are like fashion trends - they use past looks to predict today's hot styles. 💁‍♀️

This fabulous analysis is inspired by the latest option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks—especially Delta and Gamma, darling. Most importantly, once we have these greeks, we can simulate their changes at different price points, like changing outfits for different occasions. 💃

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts as dramatically as a superhero's cape caught in a jet turbine. 🚀

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that creates trading signals, as fabulous as a perfectly tailored suit. 🕴️

## Notes - A Touch of Sophistication 🎩

* If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious, darling. Something changed, like last season's fashion trends.
* Sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit as you please, like a graceful exit from a runway. 💅
* Risk up to 1% of your total capital on any trades, but if your conviction is lower, only allocate 0.5% or 0.25%, like accessorizing with discretion. 📿
* Trades were calculated before the market opened, so they're based on yesterday's news, darling. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter late. 📰

## FAQ - Answers as Timeless as the Little Black Dress 👗

$NVDA and $AMD stocks are down 60% in the last year. Is it a good time to invest or too dangerous?

$NVDA started off making chips for video games and now is leading with high-performance GPUs for PC gaming, augmented virtualization, and data centers. Also, getting into new projects with their AI, powering the metaverse, creating EARTH 2 (helping predict climate change), data centers, and simulators in the AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES industry (with clients from $MBG.DEDE to $NIO).

$AMD similar to $NVDA is a semiconductor company that operated in the computing and graphics segments. Some of $AMD's main projects are, Google Cloud Confidential Computing, advancing data centers, discoveries on mars, and the advance of AI getting into smart homes and autonomous vehicles. Also, $AMD recently acquired Xilinx to tap the high-performance and adaptive computing opportunity.

At the height of the pandemic, semiconductors stocks witnessed a high demand and growth, with everyone upgrading the devices while staying at home, making three years of sales in two.

Now worldwide PC shipments reported their steepest-ever decline of 19.5% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reported the sharpest dip of 26.4%.

Many businesses lowered their technology spending due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

Which one would you buy the dip?

* $AMD has a market cap of 104B and $16.434B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 29%.
* $NVDA has a market cap of 400B and $26.914B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 16.5%
* Debt/ Equity ratio of $NVDA is 0.492 compared to $AMD 0.053
* Price to FCF of $AMD 27.635, $NVDA is 83.393
* $NVDA P/S is 14.066 compared to $AMD 4.139

$AMD like $NVDA has a lot of similarities and will probably benefit a lot from its work with open AI and autonomous vehicles. $NVDA has an advantage in GPUs for PC gaming but $AMD has a diverse product portfolio of CPU, SoC, FPGA, and GPU.

Looking at its financials, projects, and company history I would invest in $AMD.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, DALLE and other ventures can answer questions, generate images and other media, even write songs or poetry when prompted. This has sparked debates on its implications for education and excitement for other applications, adding to the intrigue around AI.Will this technology give ol' blue-chip $MSFT an edge over its competitors like $GOOG or $AAPL? If Microsoft utilizes ChatGPT in its products and services, it could potentially give them an advantage in areas such as natural language processing and language generation. But it also depends on how well  Microsoft will integrate and utilize the model, as well as the competition's own capabilities in these areas.

# How is this tech currently being used?

**Google** has integrated natural language processing (NLP) and generation into various products and services. Some examples include:

* Google Search: NLP is used to understand the intent of the user's query and return relevant results.
* Google Assistant: NLP is used to understand the user's spoken or written request and generate a response.
* Google Translate: NLP is used to understand the text in one language and generate a translation in another language.
* Google Docs: NLP is used to understand the content of the document and suggest grammar and style improvements.
* Google Duplex: NLP and generation is used to mimic human speech and carry out tasks like making phone calls or booking reservations in a very natural way.

These are just a few examples, Google is also doing a lot of research in these areas and is likely to continue to integrate NLP and generation into new and existing products in the future.

**Apple** has integrated natural language processing (NLP) and generation into various products and services. Some examples include:

* Siri: NLP is used to understand the user's spoken or written request and generate a response.
* QuickType: NLP is used to understand the context of a message and suggest appropriate responses.
* Dictation: NLP is used to transcribe spoken words into written text.
* Apple Music: NLP is used to understand the context of a song and suggest similar songs or playlists.
* Apple News: NLP is used to understand the content of articles and suggest news stories that may be of interest to the user.

Apple also uses NLP in other products such as the App Store, where it uses NLP algorithms to understand the content of apps, helping to surface the most relevant apps to users.

# OpenAI isn't the first startup to be acquired

In recent years, Apple has been investing more and more in NLP, and machine learning, it acquired a number of startups specialized in NLP and speech recognition, which could indicate that they will continue to integrate these technologies into new and existing products.

Some notable examples include:

1. **Vilynx**: developed a deep learning-based platform that used NLP and computer vision to help users find, organize and share content.
2. **Spektral:** developed technology that used graph convolutional neural networks for real-time video and image segmentation.
3. **Turi**: developed a machine learning platform for developers, which included tools for NLP, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
4. **Silk Labs**: helps devices understand and respond to natural language commands.
5. **Emotient**: This startup developed a NLP-based platform that uses facial expression recognition to analyze emotions in videos and images and developed advanced speech recognition and natural language processing technology to improve Siri and other Apple services.

Google hasn't been sitting around idle either, here are some of the notable acquisitions the company has made as well in this arena:

1. DeepMind: developed a deep learning-based platform that uses NLP and computer vision to help users find, organize and share content.
2. Wavii: uses deep learning to understand and summarize news articles.
3. Bot & Dolly: uses computer vision and robotics to automate the movie-making process.
4. Senosis: uses smartphone sensors to monitor health.
5. Api.ai: allows developers to build conversational interfaces for mobile apps and connected devices.
6. Moodstocks: developed a NLP-based image recognition platform for mobile devices.
7. Owlchemy Labs: developed a platform for natural language interactions in virtual reality.
8. Kuki: developed virtual assistant technology for mobile devices.

Microsoft declined to provide a specific dollar amount. Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft was in talks to invest $10 billion.

The deal marks the third phase of the partnership between the two companies, following Microsoft’s previous investments in 2019 and 2021. Microsoft said the renewed partnership will accelerate breakthroughs in AI and help both companies commercialize advanced technologies in the future.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the release.

OpenAI works closely with Microsoft’s cloud service Azure. In July 2019, Microsoft backed OpenAI with $1 billion, and the investment made Microsoft the “exclusive” provider of cloud computing services to OpenAI. Microsoft said Azure will continue to serve as OpenAI’s exclusive provider.

Microsoft’s investment will also help the two companies engage in supercomputing at scale, and create new AI-powered experiences, the release said.

78,AI DEEZ NUTS,37,119on3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/119on3f/ai_deez_nuts/,49,1677127240.0,"**Preamble.**

Note: this is a play concerning C3.AI (ticker: AI). Recent NVDA earnings report is used as supporting evidence. I am not suggesting any NVDA positions, only AI positions. 

**Prelude.**

So it’s no secret that all the NVDA bears got ass blasted by their better-than-feared earnings report. Even I must concede that it was a pretty good report, especially given that their gaming revenues came in at $1.83b compared to analyst expectations of $1.59b, even in this ass gaming market. They even raised guidance \~5% due to further anticipated recovery in the gaming market.

HOWEVER, data center actually missed revenue estimates, coming in at $3.62b vs $3.85b. For the unaware smooth brains, data centers are where the GPUs that process AI training workloads are stored and maintained. This should not have been too surprising as most big tech companies that reported already told you they were cutting back on cloud/data center spend.

**Stay with me, as this brings me to my next point.**

There has been an AI hype trade recently, obviously, and I am call bullshit *now*. There is nothing in that NVDA report to suggest that spending on AI infrastructure is manifestly increasing \*in the near term\* at all. The conference call was filled with straight up hopium. The reality is that most tech companies are scaling back their spend on *new* data center infrastructure due to tougher macro conditions. Most earnings calls have made that clear. Ignore the hype, follow the money. Enterprise spend is slowing.

Therefore, the recent AI hype rally irrational exuberance. Remember, when you buy a stock you are paying for future earnings, not Jensen Huang’s hopium laced bathwater. All of a sudden a bunch of normies are excited that ChatGPT can give them a pizza recipe and they think AI is the future of everything. AI was not invented in 2023. These companies have been making these investments for decades, and this hype cycle is not materially changing anything as far as I can tell.

Sure, GOOG feels some more pressure to not shit the bed on execution, but most AI related companies like NVDA are just following their long term plans and acting more conservatively if anything, due to tighter monetary conditions and macro headwinds.

**Oh, did you forget that money is literally not free anymore? This brings me to my final point and play.**

The 6M treasury bill is yielding \~5%. Literally a year ago that shit was basically zero. Therefore, the risk/reward on owning stocks that burn money with no earnings grows more regarded by the day. Furthermore, the economy is holding up better than expected and recently inflation has proved to be stickier than expected, so you bet your left ass cheek that rates are going higher

**Enter: C3.AI (ticker symbol AI).**

This is some shit tier company with literally no moat. They make EnTeRpRiSe Ai FoR HiGh VaLuE UsE CaSeS and their website looks like some coked up incel VC’s wet dream. It IPO’d in 2020 during peak market insanity for billions of dollars and is still worth billions of dollars.

Did you know that it is possible for a company to not be worth billions of dollars? That shit may have flown in a zero rate / free money environment. It is not gonna fly now. But would you look at that, it is up over 100% YTD because of the aforementioned AI hype trade.

This is where rational market participants can take advantage of irrational exuberance using \~\~defined risk strategies\~\~ regarded options plays.

**The play.**

Look at the 4/21 options chain. The 20 strike poot is trading around 2.5, likely lower tomorrow due to the NVDA sympathy pump. This breaks even at 17.5 and gives you 58 DTE. AI was trading around 10 literally last month!!!!! Therefore, I believe the options market is inadequately pricing in the risk of a severe correction / crash in this ticker.

This is not gonna be a 10 bagger due to high IV, but a 1 bagger at 15 is easily doable and a 3-4 bagger is possible if it makes a new 52w low. I like the risk/reward and I DON’T like this low quality AI rally.

Bear case fundamentals: large scale AI adoption actually makes it *harder* for smaller companies to compete, NOT easier. The performance of AI models depends mainly on the quality and amount of the training data. Big tech has a run away advantage here. Everyone is using roughly the same algorithms. Even your whore grandmother is running stochastic gradient descent on her Lenovo Thinkpad these days.

In the words of our lord and savior Jensen Huang, “Large language models are called large because they are quite large.” This is the reason DeepMind (GOOG) came up with the best solution to the protein folding problem with AlphaFold2 in decades, which is arguably the most fundamental and high value problem in molecular biochemistry and biophysics. Data sets are more important than algorithms, so big tech will always win this battle. By the way, AlphaFold came out in 2020, AI is not new jfc.

Bull case fundamentals: they get acquired and ber r fuk.

I will leave you with this quote from a machine learning review am reading: “This is far from the first time we have seen the use of the term artificial intelligence and the grandiose promises that it implies. In fact, the early 1950’s and 1960’s as well as the early 1980’s saw similar AI bubbles (see this interesting summary by Luke Muehlhauser for Open Philanthropy (Muehlhauser, 2016)). These AI bubbles have been followed by what have been dubbed ‘‘AI Winters’’ (McDermott et al., 1985).”

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)"

# Friday’s Trade Recap

No trades today. Too busy around the house. Will be taking first half of next week off due to FOMC.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

At the end of a week that saw recession fears resurface and a higher-than-expected inflation reading just a few days before the Fed's decision, stock traders took risk off the table.

The S&P 500 extended losses in the final hour of trading after trading sideways for the majority of the session. Treasury 10-year yields have risen to near 3.6%. The dollar wavered.

Short-term inflation expectations in the US unexpectedly fell to their lowest level in more than a year, and consumer sentiment improved, aided by lower gasoline prices. In a separate report, producer prices rose more than expected in November, driven by services, highlighting the stickiness of inflationary pressures that supports Fed interest-rate increases through 2023.

In the run-up to the Fed meeting, all eyes will be on Tuesday's consumer inflation print, which is expected to show that inflation, while still far too high, has slowed. US central bankers, including chair Jerome Powell, have signalled a slowing in the pace of rate hikes while stressing that borrowing costs must continue to rise and remain restrictive for some time in order to beat inflation.

According to the federal open market committee's median projection, the benchmark will peak at 4.9% in 2023, reflecting a 4.75%-5% target range, up from 4.6% in September. That would come as a surprise to investors, who currently expect rates to be cut by a half percentage point in the second half of next year, with rates peaking around 4.9%. Currently, the range is between 3.75% and 4%.  
While many investors are eager for the Fed to deliver its final rate hike, BoA strategists believe they should be cautious while inflation remains high.

I became a freak in the Google Sheets and Chromed out my whole compute stack. The iPhone was lit, and the Mac worked like a boss. They put my dude Microsoft to shame. Office 365 and Windows became a pain to use. Windows mobile and Internet Explorer were bad jokes. And rip that guy with the Zune tattoo. I had all but given up on my old friend Microsoft.

But then - I heard that musical trill from Back to the Future - and something amazing started to happen. My dude never gave up. He cut his losses. And he went open-source. VSCode stepped out onto the playground and rolled over Emacs and Vim like dogs. Github came on the team and started carrying. Azure DevOps got him sexy in the big leagues again. I even bought a Surface Duo to use as my phone... and now everywhere I go people stop me and demand to know who made my phone. Microsoft, folks. Microsoft made it.

Copilot hit the scene, and a crowd started to gather. MSFT saw OpenAI comin' up with GPT and took him right under his wing. And the impossible happened. Bing rolled over Google search, rolled him right over in public and took the high ground. 

The GPT train has only just started rolling, bois and gals. And if you want to bet on the biggest swingin' dick in town to ride that bull... you better believe it's your boy MSFT Microsoft swingin' that hog. And I couldn't be more proud.

Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures.

# Background

Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.

# Purpose

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.

# Methodology

Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:

* Discounted Free Cash Flow
* Graham's Fair Value
* Graham's Number

# Industry Outlook

**Overview**

The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.

Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.

Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:

* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.
* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.
* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.
* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.

In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.

It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.

The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.

Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.
* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.
* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.

These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.

# Fair Value

Taking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.

**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**

Plugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36

**Graham's Fair Value**

The Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.

**Graham's Number**

By using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.

# Conclusions

**Disclaimer**

We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.

**The Future**

Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.

**Conclusions**

INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.

# **S&P 500 and Nasdaq end Friday lower after November jobs report; indexes notch weekly gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> Stocks cut much of their earlier losses Friday as investors looked past hotter-than-expected labor data to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up just 34.87 points, or 0.1%, to 34,429.88 points after hitting a session low of more than 350 points down. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to 4,071.70, rebounding from an earlier loss of 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also made up ground to end nearly 0.2% lower at 11,461.50 points. The tech-heavy index dropped as much as 1.6% earlier in the day.
*****
> All three indexes set weekly gains, with the Nasdaq posting the largest increase at nearly 2.1%. The S&P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow ticked up by 0.2%. Friday’s close marked the first time the three major indexes notched back-to-back weekly gains since October.
*****
> Stocks dipped after labor data released Friday morning showed payrolls rose by 263,000 in November, a bigger gain than the 200,000 increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Average hourly earnings also came in above expectations, jumping 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% against the same month a year ago. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.
*****
> The market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on. Market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as December.
*****
> “Just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after Powell’s speech,” said Anna Han, vice president at Wells Fargo Securities. “He’s confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation, so I think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off.”
*****
> It was the final monthly employment report before the Fed’s two-day meeting Dec. 13-14, in which the central bank is expected to slow to a 50 basis point interest rate hike from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd27a1ab99c3a122fd055c369cb12cf7/378af1d4ed5f33f3-99/s500x750/1909a4cfe63b634b8e837a88ef1087914fe19c28.jpg))**

> There was a stat floating around the internet and business news channels this week that stated when the S&P 500 was down 15% or more year-to-date (YTD) on November 30 December was down >2% on average. We ran the numbers yesterday before the big rally on Fed Chair Powell’s “makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases” comments yesterday at the Brookings Institute.

> What we found was that most of the carnage after November YTD losses > 15% occurred in the Great Depression years and since WWII December has performed much better after a down >15% YTD November. During the Depression after these November YTD >15% losses December was down 3 of 4 with an average loss of -5.4%. In the six years since 1939 with these November YTD >15% losses December was up 3, down 3 with an average loss of -0.3%.

> But with the big 3.1% gain in the S&P 500 on November 30, the YTD loss receded above the -15% mark to -14.4% on the heels of a 5.4% gain for the month, which is also a 14.1 percent rally off the October 12 low. And this marks the first back-to-back monthly gains of over 5% each month since August 2020, the ones before that were in March-May 2009. It’s the 14th such occurrence since 1950. The previous 13 all occurred in bull markets.

> Now, when the S&P 500 is down YTD November less than 15%, December’s performance is not so bad at all, just a tad below the average 1.6% to 1.1%, up 17 of 23 or 74% of the time. We still expect some chop as the bull market finds its footing, but we remain bullish and anticipate the yearend rally to continue to climb the proverbial “wall of worry” and for the Santa Claus Rally to come to town.

> # Country ETFs Outperforming US Recently

> For most major global equity markets, at some point this Fall a 52-week low has been put in place, with significant rallies since then. As shown below, of the 22 ETFs tracking key country stock markets in our Global Macro Dashboard, the average gain off the low is now 22%. The largest of these rallies have come from Germany (EWG), Italy (EWI), and China (MCHI), which have all risen over 30%. For China, that gain has come in the shortest span of time with October 31st being its low, whereas Italy and Germany's lows were a few weeks further back. One other interesting note regarding China is currently it trades only slightly above its 50-DMA whereas a majority of other country ETFs are in or at least near overbought territory. On the other end of the spectrum, the US (SPY) has experienced the most modest rally having only risen 13.82%. India (INDA) is close behind with a 13.89% gain, although it bottomed before the rest of the world with its 52-week low being back on June 17th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120122-GMD-1.png))**

> While much of the rest of the world has experienced a larger rebound off the lows, year to date performance between the US (SPY) and global equities excluding the US—proxied by the MSCI All World ex. US ETF (CWI)—is now very similar. The US is marginally in the lead with a -14.12% YTD total return versus a 14.45% drop for CWI. At the lows at the end of Q3, international markets were underperforming the US by more than 5 percentage points, but that gap has been closed during the current rally.

> # Five Good Signs for The Bulls In 2023

> Can you believe it? We made it to December! As we noted yesterday, we wouldn’t be surprised if we finished this year with some more green, but today we’ll look into the future and what could be in store in 2023.

> First things first, let’s start with something simple. Stocks will likely be lower this year; we can all agree there. How likely is the S&P 500 to be down two years in a row? The bottom line, it is pretty rare for back-to-back yearly losses, and we don’t expect it to happen this time either. In fact, over the past 50 years, it has only happened twice. There was a three-year losing streak after the tech bubble burst in 2000, 2001, and 2002, then back-to-back losses during the vicious recession of 1973 and 1974. So it ‘could’ happen, but we don’t see many similarities between now and those two times, suggesting next year should be a bounce-back year for stocks.

> Another potential positive is that when the S&P 500 is lower during a midterm year (like we will likely see in 2022), the following year has been extremely strong. Since 1950, the year after a negative midterm year saw the S&P 500 higher all eight times, with a very impressive yearly return of 24.6%. Looking at the past 50 years, things are even better, as the ‘worst’ next year was 26.3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture1.png))**

> Thirdly, and somewhat similar to above, pre-election years historically are very strong for stocks, with the S&P 500 up 16.8% on average and higher 88.9% of the time. Midterm years are the worst, which clearly played out this year. All in all, that’s something for bulls to be excited about in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-800x407.png))**

> Fourth, we hear a lot about how a recession is coming in 2023, but we aren’t so sure. Sonu did a great job discussing some of this here and here.

> The bottom line to us is that the consumer makes up 70% of the economy, and is still in good shape and spending. But could a recession start next year? Well, history would say it would be rare. That’s right, we found that out of the past 13 recessions, none started in a pre-election year. Full disclosure, we did see recessions begin in January in 1970 and 2008, so those were just a month away. But all in all, this is another potential positive for the bulls in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture3.png))**

> Lastly, stocks soared yesterday as investors realize that the Fed will likely end their series of aggressive rate hikes potentially quite soon. As a result of yesterday’s big move, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than seven months. We took a look, and this could be potentially quite bullish.

> As you can see here, previous times that saw streaks end at least six months beneath the 200-day moving average resulted in solid performance going forward. In fact, since 1950, only one out of 13 times stocks went on to make new lows, which was in 2002.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture4.png))**

> Here are the longest streaks beneath the 200-day moving average and what happened once the streak ended. Up 18.8% a year later and higher more than 92% of the time is one thing that could have bulls smiling in 2023.

> # Will Santa Bring Jolly or Coal to Investors This December?

> Can you believe it? We’ve made it to the last month of the year! I don’t know about you all, but I’ll be pretty happy to wish 2022 goodbye as soon as possible. But the good news is that we continue to think the mid-October lows were the lows from the bear market, and continued good times could be coming. I’ll break down some positive signs tomorrow on the blog, but today I’ll show why there’s a chance Santa will come to town and bring some green with him this December.

> First things first, December is historically known as one of the best months for investors, and this is true. Only once did the S&P 500 see December turn out to be the worst month of the year. That was in 2018 when the Fed made one rate hike too many, and investors weren’t very festive about things, sending December down a record 9.2%.

> As the chart shows below, December is still up over the past ten years (so including that massive drop in 2018), and that is mainly because the past three years, this final month has gained 2.9%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively. Looking further, it ranks as the third-best month since 1950, with only April and November better. In fact, until 2018, this month was historically the best. Lastly, in a midterm year, October is the best month, November is the second best, and December is the third best.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-800x338.png))**

> Some other things to know:
> * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.
> * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
> * Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.
> * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.
> * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #2!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dec-worst-mo-of-year-800x339.png))**

> The bottom line is that with inflation likely peaking, the U.S. dollar weakening, positive seasonals, a potentially more dovish Fed, investors still extremely bearishly positioned (bullish from a contrarian point of view), broadening overall market participation, a stronger than expected consumer, and crude oil back to near flat for the year, there are many former headwinds, which have now become potential tailwinds. When all is said and done with 2022, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this year end higher than where it is today.

> # A Popular Recession Indicator is Flashing Bright Red. Should We Worry?

> A political strategist once said that if there were reincarnation, he would want to come back as the bond market. “You can intimidate everybody,” as he put it. With good reason, investors watch bond markets carefully for all sorts of signals about the economy, monetary policy, and inflation.

> And right now, a key signal from the bond market – the yield curve – is flashing bright red, warning about impending recession. The yield curve is simply a curve showing interest rates on US treasury bonds across various maturities. Yields on the short end of the curve, i.e., smaller maturities, typically rise and fall depending on what investors expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to do over the next year or two. Interest rates on the long end of the curve, with maturities of 5 years or more, are typically higher than those on the short end. If investors anticipate higher growth and inflation, they will demand much higher interest rates, widening the “spread” of difference between short and long-term yields.

> In extreme cases, we get inverted yield curves, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. This normally does not make intuitive sense since it implies that long-term investors, who face more uncertainty and risk, are settling for less compensation than short-term investors. It typically happens when the Fed raises interest rates to prevent overheating of an economy (like they have this year), while bond market investors kind of take the opposing view – believing that the Fed will go too far and push the economy into recession, which would be accompanied by much lower inflation and hence, lower long-term yields.

> The yield curve inverted prior to the last ten recessions, with just one false signal in 1965. The table below shows yield curve inversions (as defined by the 10-year/1-year spread turning negative), along with the timing of the recession that followed. No surprise that this is a favored recession indicator.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-yield-curve-inversions-table-800x679.png))**

> The chart below shows how the 10-year/1-year spread has gone negative prior to the shaded bars, i.e., recessions. The bad news is that this spread inverted back in July of this year and is currently at its most negative, or “inverted state,” since 1982. Indicating a recession is on the horizon if you consider the historical precedent.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-picture-yield-spread-602x800.png))**

> # What does it really tell us, beyond “Yes, Recession”
> One thing you notice from the table and chart above is that while a recession has followed inversion, the degree of inversion doesn’t say anything about the following:
> * When a recession will start – the start time has varied from 7 to 24 months
> * How long the recession will last – we had prolonged recessions in 1974 and 2008, and the degree of inversion was quite different prior to these
> * How deep the recession will be – the degree of inversion was similar prior to the 2001 and 2008 recessions, but these were very different economic drawdowns
> Another huge caveat I would add to the track record: the inversion in 2019 technically preceded the 2020 recession, but it didn’t really “predict” it in that it didn’t predict Covid-19.

> Also, the yield curve has a bit of a dubious record outside the US, as this study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve points out. Several yield curve inversions occurred in the U.K. and Canada that did not predate recessions, i.e., you had a lot of false signals. But it worked better in the US, France, and Germany.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-st-louis-fed-study-inversions-800x575.png))**

> # A symptom rather than a cause
> Yield curve inversion is more of a symptom rather than a cause. The logic is that the Fed tightening too far leads to an expectation of slower economic growth (or recession), which leads to lower inflation expectations (there’s less demand for goods and services). Which in turn results in long-term yields falling below short-term yields. To a first approximation, long-term yields are simply the expected path of future short-term rates, i.e., monetary policy. And so, if inflation is expected to be lower in the future, especially amidst a recession, you would expect the Fed to reduce rates.

> Note that higher rates can take their toll on the economy. For example, housing activity can decline amid higher mortgage rates, and businesses may cut back on spending/hiring if they find borrowing terms to be much higher. But these usually occur only with a lag – which is why a recession doesn’t follow immediately after the Fed raises rates and yield curves invert.

> # Look toward inflation expectations
> With respect to yield curve inversions, a lot of it comes down to inflation expectations. Inflation expectations can fall if investors expect a recession.

> But, longer-term inflation expectations can also be lower than short-term inflation expectations if inflation has surged recently and investors believe it to be a short-term phenomenon. Sound familiar?

> It’s not easy to directly gauge inflation expectations, but we can calculate them using securities called inflation swaps. Without getting into too much detail, these are used to transfer inflation risk from one entity to another. You have swaps ranging over various periods, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which can tell you what investors expect inflation to average over these periods.

> The chart below shows 1-year inflation expectations versus 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectations. The latter is the inflation expectation over the 9-year period that begins one year from now – my goal is to separate short-term inflation expectations from longer-term expectations. As you can see, 1-year inflation expectations surged above longer-term expectations over the past 18-20 months. Prior to 2021, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation was mostly above the 1-year. But they’re converging again, with investors expecting inflation to average about 2.7% over the next year. At the same time, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is just under 2.6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-inflation-expectations-592x800.png))**

> What also comes out of the graph is that during the 2008 and 2020 recessions, 1-year inflation expectations collapsed well below the longer-term series. Based on that, it doesn’t look like markets are expecting a recession now.
> * 1-year inflation expectations are still slightly above the 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectation
> * 1-year/9-year expectations have barely fallen, in contrast to what we saw in 2008 and 2020 when they were below 2%
> Could we be headed for stagflation, i.e., a recession with high inflation? Well, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is around 2.6% right now – it doesn’t exactly scream stagflation, let alone high inflation.

> To wrap up, the yield curve may be as inverted as it is today because the Fed is hiking short-term rates even as long-term yields fall on the back of lower inflation expectations – in a sense vindicating the rate hikes. However, there are other factors, including a reversal of supply-chain-related issues that pushed inflation higher in the first place. My colleague, Ryan Detrick, and I have written quite a lot about why we think inflation is off the boil (see here and here).

> And just as important, inflation expectations beyond a year are not pointing toward a deflationary recession or stagflation, for that matter.

> Of course, investors could be wrong, and things could change in a hurry. This is something I’ll be watching closely.

> # Typical December Seasonal Pattern Begins Dull Pops Mid-Month

> December’s first trading day has been bearish for S&P 500 and Russell 1000 over the last 21 years. A modest rally through the fifth or sixth trading day also has fizzled going into mid-month. It is around this point that holiday cheer tends to kick in and propel the indexes higher with a pause near month-end.

> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect, 2023 Almanac pages 112 &114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2023 Almanac page 18), which states as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

> The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on December 23 and lasts until the second trading day of 2023. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. The “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) was invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac.

> This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # December #2 Small Cap #3 Large Cap Tepid Start Solid Finish

> Trading in December is holiday-inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins.

> December is the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. It’s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and fourth best for NASDAQ (1971). It is also the third best month for Russell 1000 (1979).

> In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 does not seem highly likely this year.

> When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/622df92caae1f1d36246081b8c04ec3f/19c407a38165e76c-b2/s400x600/a5ece9d71341061ea8853d22d94d38c5b51b9519.jpg))**

> In the last eighteen midterm years, December’s rankings slip modestly to #5 DJIA (0.9%), #3 S&P 500 (1.2%) and #7 NASDAQ (–0.3% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also tend to soften in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just three times in ten midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is 0.3%. Midterm December performance had been stronger prior to previously mentioned December 2018.

# [Stock futures rise as S&P 500 and Dow try to bounce back from lowest levels since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-sp-500-closes-at-lowest-level-since-2020.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
> S&P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
> The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
> Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
> Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
> The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
> “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
> On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

# Friday’s Trade Recap

Took the day off.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

>US stocks ended the day with a slight gain, despite Federal Reserve warnings that more policy tightening was on the way. Oil futures fell on indications that the market is currently oversupplied.  
>  
>The S&P 500 index gained 0.5% on Friday to finish the week down 0.7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2% in the previous five days. Trading volumes were low during Friday's $2.1 trillion options expiration, which is typically a day when volatility spikes as traders and dealers rebalance their large exposures.  
>  
>Treasury yields rose again on Thursday following hawkish remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said interest rates needed to rise to at least 5%-5.25% to curb inflation.  
>  
>Similarly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated on Thursday that it is a open question how far the central bank needs to go with rates to bring demand back into balance.  
>  
>Continuously rising interest rates are already putting pressure on global demand. Copper and Oil prices, which are sensitive to growth, were set to fall for the week due to concerns about a worsening outlook. For the first time in nearly a year, US Crude futures indicated an oversupply. Higher mortgage rates slowed sales of previously owned US homes for the ninth consecutive month in October.  
>  
>However, some equity investors believe that hawkish Fed commentary does not necessarily imply that rates will peak at higher levels than previously thought. And traders remain confident that the Fed will reverse course and begin cutting rates in late 2023.

# 🕵️‍♂️ I SPY TA - Monday November 21, 2022

Week of November 21 fluid expectation from option ai.

We are ABOVE the **20 MA (385.82)** and will be key for bulls to hold above next week. We do have the **200 MA at 405.01** and is an upside target if we continue this rally rest of month.

* Downside targets:
   * 395.19
   * 390.08
   * 384.96
   * 377.69
* Upside targets:
   * 401.51

We are near the backtesting failure swing on RSI. Still within striking distance of the 200 MA. It will be key for bulls to hold the gap and/or 20 MA next week if we continue to see downside.

## 20 MA Support Retest on the Menu?

200 MA has been a tough nut to crack this year. We do have a potential end of year rally to 420 - 430. Personally don think we see over 410 - 412 but let’s see how end of year plays out.

Now just waiting for bullish confirmation for the next leg. Be mindful that this is where we could see a reversal. We might find something similar to July before the next move up or down here.

Upside targets:

* 407
* 412
* 420
* 430

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

https://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36a1692e0231e6e13db3c2551ae71f527dfbc24a

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f806155aab9fd81752398686ad7d6f6b62049fa

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b2417e86d164cbcd433b395f10e4669a0f99c8b)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a03c9400e071a8e576b483fac7b64955933b250d

&#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=26b4e09f4b98d4801594fe8599ab0ebe798612f4

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0454a4a58556c4ceb27983d2c27fa3b5195eccd5)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

91,A detailed DD for AMD in AI (Instinct MI300 breakdown),28,1499y3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1499y3o/a_detailed_dd_for_amd_in_ai_instinct_mi300/,13,1686754405.0,"Hello fellow degens, this is a followup for my DD on Nvidia:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

I'll have you know that since I posted that, NVDA has gone up 40% and I'm quite handsomely profitable. I still think Nvidia is a winner and I am holding my position. Also an interesting fact is I was the first person in the market to buy that particular call strike/date, but now the OI on that call is 635. Its now the highest OI OTM NVDA call out of any long term dates, and I'm going to take credit for all the other regards that bought into that call. **So a total of $5.8M was invested because of my last DD on just that option alone, and there's probably a lot more investment that can be attributed to my post. You're welcome regards.**

**This post is about AMD's newly announced Instinct MI300**, which is their contender for best AI chip. The release was met with lukewarm reaction from the market, and my guess is because it didn't include ASIC tensor units like Nvidia's H100. However, it still is going to be competitive in AI and it boils down to this:

**Processing speed isn't everything.**

The H100 will blow the MI300 out of the water when it comes to raw processing speed and raw processing efficiency for AI tasks, but the MI300 does have one trick up its sleeve: very high memory capacity and very high memory bandwidth.

**Where the H100 has 80 GB of memory per card, and the MI300 has 192 GB per chip.**

Memory is critical for large language models (LLMs), because the top models now need over 100 GB of memory to run efficiently -- meaning no single GPU can run them currently. You can split up the memory of the models onto multiple cards or keep some of the model in RAM, but this dramatically slows down calculations. For this reason, memory is a HUGE bottleneck for LLMs.

**The MI300 will be the only option for extremely large models (the smartest ones) when it comes out in Q2.**

Furthermore the MI300 has another trick up its sleeve: Its HBM memory is directly on chip integrated into the AMD Infinity Fabric bus, as compared to Nvidia's cards where the HBM is on separate chips on the card. This means AMD inherently can get much higher memory bandwidth. Estimates are 8TB/s for the MI300 vs 2-3 TB/S for the H100. This will mean that tensors can be loaded into the MI300's GPU more efficiently causing less latency (downtime) for the processing units.

More interesting facts about the MI300:

* It is an APU, meaning it has both a GPU and a CPU
* The CPU is a basically like a 24 core Ryzen
* The GPU is like smashing over two 7900XTX's together (its titanic)
* This is one of the largest ICs ever at 146B transistors (The H100 is 80B transistors)

What does all this mean?

* **For non-AI compute workloads the MI300 is likely to be the king of efficiency out of any available products** \-- it will be widely deployed in supercomputers across the world. Their first flagship customer is the DOE, which owns a large portion of the largest super computers in the world.
* **Also for the largest AI workloads, it will be the only good option for a few months until the H100 NVL comes out**

How does it stack against the H100 NVL? The NVL model is a new version of the H100 coming out in the second half of the year. It is basically like a normal H100 that is capable of SLI (NVLink). This allows users to put two H100 NVLs together via a special link so they operate like one logical compute unit. That will give Nvidia a 188 GB option (via 2 cards linked together). However NVLink has extremely poor memory bandwidth which will exacerbate the difference between the MI300's extremely good memory bandwidth. Its hard to say whether the H100 NVL solution will be better than the MI300 for very large language models, but my guess is the H100 NVL will probably be better for most. The MI300 will be excellent for them however, so its likely that many cloud providers will chose it because it is also fantastic for general purpose OpenCL where the H100 is a specialized card.

What am I doing? I'm buying some AMD in addition to my NVDA. I've also bought some SMH calls which have exposure to both NVDA and AMD. I'm at about 4:1 exposure NVDA:AMD right now, but I'll bring that up to 2:1.

* Companies can save exponentially more money with AI.
* For example, as a company, you used to have to pay $85/hr and a total of 10 hours ($850 total) to write a good blog post for marketing. With LLMs (large language models), you can generate an article and ask your writer to spend one hour editing it. The cost to produce a blog post of similar quality went from $850 to $85 and the speed to produce it went from 2 days to 1 hour. Evidence that this is already happening: [https://reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12ff5mw/it\_happened\_to\_me\_today/](https://old.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12ff5mw/it_happened_to_me_today/)
* It's rare to see an exponential increase in productivity like the above. Perhaps this kind of tech comes around every 50 years? Steam engine, electricity, internet level of impact.
* Soon, many workers will be exponentially more productive.
* Things that used to cost a lot of money to produce will be cheap.
* We're starting to get generative AI in video games, movies, music, programming, etc. as well. Even Excel and Powerpoint are getting generative AI.
* I'm a software engineer. Github CoPilot is incredibly good at helping me write code signficantly faster.
* Like the iPhone which made many workers significantly more efficient and opened entirely new industries, AI can and will likely do the same.
* Thus, corporations and stocks will benefit.
* Corporations will hire less and produce more - leading to greater profit margins and/or higher revenues.
* There will obviously be big losers and big winners but as a whole, I expect S&P 500 to continue to marge towards greater profitability and a bigger total market cap.
* GDP/year is a measure of products and services produced in a year. I expect significantly more products and services to be produced with AI than without AI. Hence, I expect GDP to accelerate.

**Other examples of LLM/AI usage to save on cost or increase speed or both:**

* Studies are now showing that GPT4 is more accurate than a doctor at diagnosing diseases, including rare diseases.
* GPT4 is often better than a lawyer at finding laws, drafting documents, compliance, and legal research. If you're a giant corporation, you now have to hire fewer lawyers.
* LLMs is faster and often better at tier 1 customer service. Combine LLMs with an AI voice and you have phone support too. Customer service is often one of the larger expenses at a company. You can replace your entire tier 1 customer service department and just hire a few advanced tier 2 people.
* LLMs can tutor your kids with their homework. Previously, you had to hire an expensive tutor.
* In HR, LLMs can now find quality candidates for you automatically - instead of paying humans to sift through thousands of resumes or spend weeks looking through LinkedIn.
* Within my own industry, I'm giving GPT4 access to my database and it's automatically generating business insights for me based on my data. This means I don't have to hire business analysts/data scientists or as many of them.

We're only 5 months into the ChatGPT era.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks have had their longest weekly losing streak since September, with investors concerned that the Fed's determination to keep raising interest rates will tip the economy into a recession.  


For the third day in a row, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 finished lower. The quarterly triple witching expiration of equity derivatives boosted market movements on Friday as well.  


The performance of US treasuries was mixed, with short-term bonds rallying on Friday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield was nearly 19 basis points lower at the end of the week. The value of the dollar had hardly changed. Oil is up for the week.  


Earlier this week, investors cheered softer-than-expected inflation data. However, the euphoria faded as Fed officials hammered home the message that rates will remain higher until they are confident that inflation has been subdued. While the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, risk assets have been under pressure since policymakers signalled a peak rate that was higher than market expectations. This week saw a wave of rate hikes and hawkish forecasts from central banks around the world, including the ECB.  


Traders also had to contend with a slew of US data this week that showed the economy cooling while the labour market remained strong. This did not sit well with investors, as labour market softening remains a major concern for the Fed.

# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice

* **\[15:32 ET\]** Fed's Mester: I expect the Fed to hike by more than its median forecast.
* **\[12:44 ET\]** Fed's Daly: If necessary, I'm prepared to maintain peak rate for more than 11 months.
* **\[08:35 ET\]** Fed's Williams: Possible that the Fed will hike more than the FOMC terminal rate forecast.

JPM shares jumped +6% on record revenue and a sharp increase in earnings. Other C, WFC results also exceeded market expectations, driving a collective pre-market rise in financial stocks.

\-Shares news: Dow component UNH results exceeded expectations, raised full-year guidance, shares rose slightly. BA again suffered parts quality problems, cut 737Max payments, shares plunged -6%. After MSFT and GOOGL, AMZN also unveiled its AI platform yesterday.

\-Treasuries and gold retreated before the market, and the dollar index rallied. Stocks were mixed, with the Nasdaq down mid-range and the S&P and Nasdaq down slightly.

\-SPY rallied strongly yesterday reversing the previous day's down move, though it still did not break the key pressure $ 413-414 area hinted at in recent days, which remains a key intraday test to the upside. If the opening is quickly passed, continue to fill last year's Jackson Hole gap. Intraday downside test is the $412-410 area suggested before yesterday's session, where resistance becomes support. Once broken again downside testing the lower edge of the nearly two-week range."

 Here's what Google is working on, in plain English:

* **Google is, of course, trying to solve complex problems to create AI that helps understand, categorize, and generate text, images, audio, and video**
* **They are making progress but don't appear to be ready to release any one product similar to ChatGPT, however specific use cases will be spoon fed into existing applications, like Gmail, YouTube, and the Pixel phone** 
* **They are working on Chain of Thought prompting, which breaks down requests into individual steps, and on models fine-tuned for specific use cases, like translation and medical contexts**
* **They want to create a single model that can work in many different use cases, regardless of context-- this is the hardest part**
* **But the most overwhelming takeaway is their insistence on ""Responsible AI""--  releasing AI in a way that is not harmful to the world so we're not flooded with biased machines and fake images and video**

There's a saying that if you can't describe what your business or product does in a few sentences, it's probably a failure. There's a whiff of that here. 15,000 complex words to basically say ""hey, we're not there yet""... all while ChatGPT is accessible and useful to humans with even a moderate IQ.

Google will release a series of blog posts updating their progress... signaling that no major products or features on the level with ChatGPT are expected to be available for widespread use this year.

Not a great look.

* **In May, they plan to announce Colab + Android Studio, a tool to make it easier to build apps for Android smartphones that will generate, complete, and fix code**
* **Another code generation and completion tool, called PaLM-Coder 2, is also in the works**
* **Google will demonstrate a version of its search engine with its ChatGPT competitor LaMBDA this year, but it's unclear whether it will actually be released to the public this year**
* **Google lags behind OpenAI's self-reported metrics when it comes to identifying content that is hateful, toxic, sexual or violent**

I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this...

Interestingly, despite these concerns, there is a noteworthy 20% of investors who remain open to the idea of using AI advisors.

&#x200B;

>However, what investors may not realize is that AI is already being employed in their financial decision-making processes. Digitally-native personal finance management tools such as Mint and NerdWallet, which inherently require machine learning and AI for efficient operation, are already leveraging AI behind the scenes. Similarly, robo-advisors, which offer automated, algorithm-based portfolio management services to investors, are powered by AI. In fact, robo-advisors are projected to manage a staggering $2.76 trillion in assets this year, highlighting the significant role of AI in this domain.

&#x200B;

>Moreover, AI plays a crucial part in other aspects of finance as well. Algorithmic trading and investment analysis heavily rely on AI capabilities. Although humans make the final decisions, AI assists in gathering and analyzing the vast amounts of data that inform these decisions.

>I trust you are all faring well amidst these protracted weeks. I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.

>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, ""The money printer is back on!"" ""We're destined for astronomical gains!"" ""S&P $5000, here we come!"" ""There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,"" and so on.  
>

>  
>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.

&#x200B;

Ewwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Recap :**

Season 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let’s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.

I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.

&#x200B;

I think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let’s analyze things from a new perspective and let’s see what markets are trynna tell us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment :** 

**""Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame""**

&#x200B;

In this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.

So let’s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let’s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So let’s just deep dive right in.

*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

USA :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)

&#x200B;

The above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a “Negative correlation” and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of “Negative correlation” But then inflation happened and that’s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in “Positive correlation” i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.

&#x200B;

But now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the “Negative correlation” where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the “Banking crisis” where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It’s one of the chapters of the “Recession playbook” that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for us?

Well in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a “negative correlation” of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.

As for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: “We are still in a strong Positive correlation” of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan & Germany :

So now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still ""Negatively correlated"" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that’s when a “Positive correlation” emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)

&#x200B;

As for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.

&#x200B;

 

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result:  Inconclusive result.

We should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn’t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn’t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

Eurusd-De10y :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don’t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don’t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f’ed then I am hoping Europe will get f’ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It’s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like “What are you talking man” “I am more confused” and “Just tell me up or down” Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383

&#x200B;

This is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let’s not assume anything. It’s still not clear. We need more data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GbpUsd - Gb10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757

&#x200B;

So now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a

&#x200B;

You can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UsdJpy - Jp10y :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2

&#x200B;

Before talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d

&#x200B;

This is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

DXY - Us 10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f10f62d643d8c56504df1b7a7bf5310f3cfab067

&#x200B;

This is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let’s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e22a7875b298311d16e96733065a51c9f472645

&#x200B;

The relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.

&#x200B;

[Monthly time frame b\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9af006387b0c80615490a12dffacac7e5ecea9ec)

&#x200B;

Now I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.

&#x200B;

Result: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Balance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms

&#x200B;

[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)

&#x200B;

As you can clearly see till October every CB’s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) 

Now some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7ddbc77e7c082b7bc41e571855b32685a268763

&#x200B;

Conclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 1: Deflationary spiral

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|\-ve Gdp|\-ve %|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But soon inflation will go low :

So, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: -ve

&#x200B;

This means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Time taken :

Normally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this ""Inverse them bruh"" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )

This trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> 3.2%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|God knows|God knows|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But then inflation will go higher :

So, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: still +ve

&#x200B;

Overall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?

&#x200B;

\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.

&#x200B;

\- 2b) Let’s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?

Ans: Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**

&#x200B;

Well folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=089fa3dad5ab985e7f667c210cfd583a34eb05af

&#x200B;

This happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. 

&#x200B;

What if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you "" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all"" 

&#x200B;

This above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.

Sorry, my image limit got hit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts :**

The real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Enjoy the weekend everyone. 

See you guys next week!

101,MSFT stock: Is that sure bet you have been looking for (My bull case),18,10guyv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10guyv7/msft_stock_is_that_sure_bet_you_have_been_looking/,34,1674215314.0,"""Hey WSB,

I just got back from a time-traveling trip to the future and let me tell you, MSFT stock is looking 🔥🔥🔥. Here's why:

   1. They're making a killing in the AI space. They invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and just recently dropped another $10 billion. I heard they're even using ChatGPT to predict the stock market.

   2. Master Elon is one of the founders of OpenAI

   3. The stock is basically a safe haven, like a government bond but with more memes.

   4. M$ dropped $19.7B to purchase Nuance Communications. Guess what they specialize in? That's right, printing fucking money. If you never heard of them, Nuance Communications is a technology company that specializes in speech recognition and natural language processing technology. They develop and provide a wide range of AI-powered products and services, they also have a tinder like dating app that helps wives’ find boyfriends. 
   
   5. ""M$ and Walmart just announced a partnership? That's like Batman and Superman teaming up, but better! M$'s AI technology is gonna make Walmart's shopping experience next-level, I bet they're gonna have AI-powered shopping carts that automatically add more snacks to your cart and even suggest recipes for dinner tonight!
	
   5. ""Looks like M$ is laying off 10,000 employees? Don't worry folks, they're just automating the workforce with AI. The robots will work 24/7 and never ask for a raise. Plus, we all know robots are better at math and don't have to take coffee breaks.
	
   6. ""M$ on the path to acquiring Activision Blizzard? Talk about a power move! Now they're not just dominating the tech game, they're taking over the gaming world too. It's only a matter of time before they release an AI-powered World of Warcraft and make billions.

In conclusion, MSFT is a no-brainer, a sure thing, a slam dunk. Don't miss out on this opportunity folks, buy the dip and HODL.

P.S: This is not financial advice, consult your therapist before investing.""

""P.P.S: This post was written by a language model, ChatGPT, also known as the AI version of Jim Cramer. Don't trust everything it says, always do your own research, consult a financial advisor and consult your therapist before investing.""

Yesterday I picked up TSLA 215c calls about 15 min after open when it hit 200, and sold right before close at around 209. Also got NVDA 230c around the same time, and sold when it touched 230. Hope you all Printed yesterday!

On Tuesday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both slipped due to higher-than-expected inflation, but the Nasdaq finished in the green. The pace of price increases was still seen as slowing down, which helped to mitigate concerns. On Wednesday, more data will be released, including indicators from the housing market, and corporate earnings reports from Kraft Heinz and Cisco. Additionally, Tesla has agreed to open up thousands of its charging stations to EVs made by other companies, which could help to further drive adoption of electric vehicles. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs has given up on plans for a branded credit card as it continues to dismantle its consumer-banking strategy. Finally, Wednesday's mortgage demand report showed a 7.7% decline in total mortgage application volume, likely due to a rise in the 30-year fixed rate. Yes CPI is over with, but remember this week is OPEX which means we could see a lot of chop. Yesterday was a prime example of that, but the range of chop was nearly 50pts so if you are trading today, use those relative strong or weak names to capitalize on this ES range.

**Overall Market Outlook: **

SPY - Bullish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We are still in a big symmetrical triangle. And we are squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Looks like we could see a nice move tomorrow! (No levels posted for now I have a bunch of paperwork I have to finish up tonight.) Expected Move +/- $3.71

QQQ- Three White Soldiers candle pattern close on the daily TF. We are now in a squeeze setting up for a move on the 1Hr TF. (No levels posted for now.) Expected Move +/- $3.76

**Watchlist:**

TSLA - Bullish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. We Engulfed the last 3 days! And we reclaimed the 200WMA on the daily. We have a possible head & shoulders on the daily RSI. And we released from the squeeze and made that nice move up! Take 225c or 230c Calls above 216.27. Take 195p or 190p Puts below 206.33. Expected Move +/- $12.39

NVDA- Bullish candle close on the daily TF. We have a tweezer top on the daily. And we closed in big supply zone. We still have a little gap above to fill also. Take 240c or 245c Calls above 231.20. Take 220p or 215p Puts below 225.26 BNH. Expected Move +/- $9.98

QCOM - The stock has come down to test its 200 daily MA for each of the past three trading days signifying the strength of this level. I believe we see a move higher for this chip stock. The semiconductor sector has been boosted by the AI hype, this outperformance should continue.

MU - This semiconductor stock jumped off its 200 daily  MA around $59 yesterday which should cause the stock to continue to move higher with the broader semi sector."
103,TSLA call buying program always goes into overdrive right before Musky dumps,21,xkmx6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xkmx6p/tsla_call_buying_program_always_goes_into/,19,1663808769.0,"The Stans will jump on Enrons shmeckle but the coincidences in the option market right before Musky dumps on his ~~exit liquidity~~ shareholders are undeniable. For example, last week on Wed Sept 14th, 250,000 300/305/10 calls expiring Friday, sept 16th were traded. This has continued day after day and only kicked into further overdrive, it's **unprecedented** this day after day action especially in the face of such market risk. The call buying only goes into extra regardation in times like late April, early August, and now. The former being when Musk dumped shares. It is of course coincidence that the call buying program volume of weekly options dies out right after Elon is done selling.

All the while, Musk is set to be deposed next week for the final slug off in the twitter trial and if Musko loses, he needs the stock price as high as possible. Not to mention, he has been shamelessly pumping on Twitter about absolutely ridiculous shit like expanding a car factory to the river and making it open to the public with ""little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victoria design"" lmao. Don't even get me started on AI day.

I for one can't wait to see the absolute gold mine the comments will be if I don't get downvoted to oblivion, especially from that super special Tesla genereal guy."

As investors analyze Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks, they are also closely monitoring the latest earnings reports. Yum Brands reported Wednesday and was followed by Chipotle's disappointing report on Tuesday. Wednesday will be the main event with Disney releasing its results, with the market paying close attention to CEO Bob Iger's plans to reduce streaming losses and possibly cut jobs. Other companies reporting on Wednesday include Under Armour, Uber, CVS Health, and Mattel. In his speech on Tuesday, Powell used the term ""disinflationary"" and acknowledged that price increases were slowing down, but also stated that the Fed could keep raising rates if the data doesn't show continued disinflationary trends. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it will be using OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, to improve its Bing search engine and Edge browser. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a surprise visit to London on Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and thank the British people for their support.

**Watchlist:** 

TSLA- Dragonfly Doji candle close on the daily TF. We have a triple top on the daily RSI. And we finally brokeout the ascending channel we been in. We are now squeezing on the 4Hr TF.

NKE - Nike came down to test support around $123.90 and held this level yesterday. I believe we see a move higher from this outperforming stock over the coming weeks especially after we got a golden cross back on January 13th which implies bullish momentum.

CLF - Cleveland Cliffs is coming down to test support around $20.40, we held this level when tested last week. I expect we see a move higher for this underperforming stock which just had a golden cross yesterday implying bullish momentum

RIOT - The stock just moved above all major daily moving averages and should really benefit from the bullish price movement from beetcoin. B T C is trading in a great spot and had the 50 day moving average cross above the 200 day moving average yesterday, implying bullish momentum."

# **Dow leaps 700 points on hot jobs report, Nasdaq notches sixth straight winning week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Friday as traders cheered a strong jobs report and the passage of a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow jumped 701.19 points, or 2.12%, to end at 33,762.76 — its best day since January. The S&P 500 climbed 1.45% to close at 4,282.37. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.07% to 13,240.77, reaching its highest level since April 2022 during the session.
*****
> With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished the holiday-shortened trading week about 1.8% and 2% higher, respectively. The Dow’s Friday advance pushed it into positive territory for the week, finishing up around 2%. The Nasdaq notched its sixth straight week higher, a streak length not seen for the technology-heavy index since 2020.
*****
> Nonfarm payrolls grew much more than expected in May, rising 339,000. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a relatively modest 190,000 increase. It marked the 29th straight month of positive job growth.
*****
> Recently strong employment data had been pressuring stocks on the notion it would keep the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. But Friday data also showed average hourly earnings rose less than economists expected year over year, while the unemployment rate was higher than anticipated.
*****
> Both data points have given investors hope that the Fed could pause its interest rate hike campaign at the policy meeting later this month, according to Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
*****
> “The so-called Goldilocks has entered the house,” Sandven said. “Clearly, on the bullish side, there are signs that inflation is starting to wane, speculation that the Fed is going to move into pause mode, increasing the likelihood of a soft landing.”
*****
> Easing concerns around the U.S. debt ceiling also helped sentiment. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday night, sending the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. That comes after the House passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday, just days before the June 5 deadline set by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*****
> Lululemon shares popped more than 11% on strong results and a guidance boost, while MongoDB surged 28% on a blowout forecast.

> # A Resilient Labor Market = A Resilient Economy

> Another month, another employment surprise. Should we be surprised anymore?

> Economists expected payrolls to grow by about 187,000 in May. That’s still a solid job growth number, but a stepdown from what we’ve seen this year through April. However, actual payroll growth beat expectations for the 14th straight month.

> The economy created 339,000 jobs in May, close to double expectations. Better still, payroll growth in March and April were revised higher by a total of 93,000!

> * March payrolls were revised up by 52,000, from 165,000 to 217,000
> * April payroll were revised up by 41,000, from 253,000 to 294,000

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-monthly-payroll-growth-601x800.png))**

> We’ve got two months of payroll data since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March, and nothing suggests weakness arising from that banking crisis.

> Over the first five months of the year, the economy’s added 1.5 million jobs. That in a nutshell tells you how the economy is doing. For perspective, the average annual payroll growth between 1940 and 2022 was 1.5 million. During the last expansion, 2010-2019, average annual payroll growth was 2.2 million per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-annual-job-growth-612x800.png))**

> **But what about the unemployment rate?**

> The unemployment rate did rise from a 50-year low of 3.4% to 3.7%. This does raise some cause for concern but digging through the data suggests it may be noise more than anything else.

> It probably helps to understand that the job growth and unemployment rate data come from different sources. The former comes from asking about 120,000+ businesses how many people they hired. The latter comes from asking about 60,000 households about their employment status. No surprise, the latter is noisier.

> A big reason for the weak household survey (and rising unemployment rate) is that more than 400,000 people who were self-employed said they were no longer employed. As you can see in the following chart this is very noisy data, but the recent trend seems to be toward lower self-employment. It’s basically reversing the surge we saw in 2021, when self-employment surged. So, what we’re seeing now may simply be normalization of the labor market as more workers move from self-employment to W2 jobs with an employer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-self-employment-600x800.png))**

> Also, the unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

> The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio dropped only a tick, from 80.8% to 80.7%. This still leaves it higher than at any point between 2002 and 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-prime-age-employment-population-ratio-614x800.png))**

> All in all, the labor market remains strong and resilient, despite all the recession calls. Perhaps its not as strong as the headline payroll growth number of 339,000 suggests, but any number above 150,000 would be good at this point. And we’re certainly well above that.

> In fact, looking at the job growth and employment-population data, this labor market is probably the strongest we’ve seen since the late 1990’s. Our view since the end of last year has been that the economy can avoid a recession this year, and nothing we’ve seen to date suggests we need to reverse that view. Far from it.

> Since 1971 June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking eighth best with an 0.8% average gain, up 29 of 52 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best 8 Months” which ends in June. Small caps also fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in June since 1979 advancing 63.6% of the time.

> June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.02% average gain).

> Despite being much stronger S&P 500 pre-election year June ranks fifth best. For the rest it is just sixth best. Average monthly gains in pre-election year June range from DJIA 1.1% to a respectable 2.4% for NASDAQ. Russell 2000 has been the most consistently bullish in pre-election years, up 8 of the last 11 (72.7% of the time).

> # The June Swoon?

> Stocks did it again, as the S&P 500 gained 0.2% in the month of May, making it now 10 of the past 11 years that stocks finished green in May. Of course, it gained only 0.01% last year and only 0.25% this year, so the recent returns weren’t off the charts by any measure.

> Looking specifically at this year, tech added more than 9% in May, thanks to excitement over AI and Nvidia, with communication services and consumer discretionary also in the green, while the other eight sectors were lower.

> Specifically, turning to the month of June, stocks historically have hit a bit of trouble here. Since 1950, up 0.03% on average, the fourth worst month of the year. Over the past 20 years, only January and September have been worse and in the past decade, it is again the fourth worst month. The one bit of good news is during a pre-election year is it up 1.5%, the fifth-best month of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-800x338.png))**

> Here’s another chart we’ve shared before, but years that gained big in January (like 2023) tend to see some periods of consolidation in late May/early June, but eventually experience a surge higher into July. Given the flattish overall May, this could be playing out again.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-800x278.png))**

> What if stocks were having a good year heading into June? Since 1950, if the S&P 500 was up more than 8% for the year going into June (like this year), the month of June was up an impressive 1.2% on average versus the average June return of 0.03%, while in a pre-election year the returns jumped to 1.8%. The percent of the time where returns were higher gets better as well, from 54.8% in your average June to nearly 74% if up 8% or more for the year heading into June, to 80% of the time higher if up 8% for the year in a pre-election year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-800x342.png))**

> Overall, it has been a very nice run for stocks this year and we remain overweight stocks in the Carson Investment Research House Views. June could potentially cause some volatility, but when all is said and done, we wouldn’t bet against more strength and higher prices in June.

*****

> # NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Lead June Pre-Election Strength

> Over the last 21 years, June has been a rather lackluster month. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. Russell 2000 has fared better with a modest average gain. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days.

> From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and returned to losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally led by technology and small caps.

> Historical performance in pre-election years has been much stronger with all five indexes finishing with average gains. June’s overall pattern in pre-election is similar to the last 21-years pattern with a brief, shallow pullback after a solid start.

> In pre-election years the mid-month rally has been much more robust beginning around the sixth trading day and lasting until the fifteenth. Followed by another modest retreat and rally into the end of Q2.

> # May and YTD 2023 Asset Class Performance

> May 2023 is now behind us, and below is a look at how various asset classes performed during the month using US-listed exchange-traded products as proxies. We also include YTD and YoY total returns.

> May was a month of divergence where Tech/AI soared, and the rest of the market fell. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) gained 7.88% in May while the Dow Jones Dividend ETF (DVY) fell 7.7%. That's a 15 percentage-point spread!

> At the sector level, it was a similar story. While the Tech sector (XLK) rose 8.9%, sectors like Energy (XLE), Consumer Staples (XLP), Materials (XLB), and Utilities (XLU) fell more than 5%. In total, 8 of 11 sectors were in the red for the month.

> Outside the US, we saw pullbacks in most areas of the world other than Brazil, India, and Japan. China, Hong Kong, France, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the UK all fell more than 5%.

> All of the commodity-related ETFs/ETNs were in the red for May, with oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) falling the most at more than 10% each.

> Finally, fixed-income ETFs also fell in May as interest rates bounced back. The aggregate bond market ETF (AGG) was down 1.14% in May, leaving it up just 2.6% YTD and down 2.2% year-over-year.

> # How Worried Should We Be About Consumer Debt?

> A very common question we get these days is whether we’re concerned about the massive increase in consumer debt.

> Short answer: No. Well, not yet anyway. But let’s walk through it in 6 charts.

> The New York Federal Reserve (NY Fed) releases a quarterly report on household debt and credit, and the latest one that was released last week came with the headline:

> “Household Debt Hits $17.05 Trillion in First Quarter.”
> But let’s look at the details. Household debt increased by $148 billion in Q1. That translates to a 0.9% increase, which is the slowest quarterly increase in two years. Most of the increase in debt was from mortgage originations ($121 billion) – mortgage debt makes up $12 trillion of the total $17 trillion in debt. The rest was auto loan and student loan balances.

> Here’s something interesting: credit card balances were flat in Q1, at $986 billion. The fact that overall balances are higher than where they were in 2019 ($927 billion) should not be surprising given we just experienced a lot of inflation. Prices rose at the fastest pace in 40 years, and so you should expect card balances to increase. However, incomes rose as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-credit-card-debt-601x800.png))**

> When you think debt, the key question is whether households are able to service that debt. A good measure of that is to look at debt service costs as a percent of disposable income. As of Q4 2022, that’s at 9.7%, slightly lower than what it was before the pandemic and well below the historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-debt-service-disposable-income-608x800.png))**

> There’s even better news: disposable income grew 2.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Significantly higher than the 0.9% increase in total household debt, let alone interest costs!

> Part of that includes the large boost to social security income due to inflation adjustments in January. Also, tax brackets were adjusted higher, resulting in more money in household wallets.

> But even if you exclude these one-off increases, disposable income growth has been strong between February and April, rising at a 5% annualized pace. In fact, employee compensation by itself has risen at a 3.9% annualized pace over the past three months. Meanwhile, inflation is running just about 3% – which means households are seeing real income gains (adjusted for inflation).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-income-vs-inflation-602x800.png))**

> This is why consumers don’t feel the need to borrow to the extent they did before the pandemic. Credit utilization rates measure credit card balances as a percent of available credit. As you can see in the following chart, utilization rates for both credit cards and home equity lines of credit are well below pre-pandemic averages.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-credit-utilization-rates-609x800.png))**

> **Lack of stress showing in delinquency data as well**

> Another way to look for signs of consumer stress is to look at the debt delinquency data. As of the first quarter, the NY Fed survey showed that the percent of loan balances that were more than 90 days delinquent was stable around 1.5%. That’s down from 1.9% a year ago, and quite a bit below the 3% average in 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-balances-by-delinquency-status-800x580.png))**

> Even third-party collections are at record lows, with just over 5% of consumers having collections against them as of the first quarter. This is down from 6% a year ago and below the 2019 average of 9.2%. The average collection amount per person is $1,316, which is lower than the $1,452 average in late 2019. This is surprising because just with inflation you’d have thought the amount would be higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-third-party-collections-800x580.png))**

> All in all, the data on consumer finances is not showing much cause for concern. So, count us in the “not worried” camp. At least, not yet.

*****

> # Some Good Inflation News

> While the market prices in a much higher likelihood of a rate hike at the June meeting, there was actually some decent news on the inflation front today. Starting with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence report, in this month's update, the inflation expectations component fell to 6.1% from a peak of 7.9% fifteen months ago in March 2022 (first time reading touched 7.9%). Looking at the chart below, this reading was also at 6.1% fifteen months before that first peak. In other words, for all the talk about how inflation has been stickier, the pace of decline in this indicator on the way down has been the same as the pace of increase on the way up.

> Another notable report was today's release of the Dallas Fed Manufacturing report. The Prices Paid component of that report showed a decline from 19.5 down to 13.8 which was the lowest reading since July 2020. For the month of May, two of the five components (Empire and Philadelphia) showed modest m/m increases from multi-month lows, and three showed significant declines to multi-month lows. The chart below shows a composite of the Prices Paid component using the z-scores for each of the five individual components going back to 2010. The peak for this component was 19 months ago in November 2021. Unlike the inflation expectations of the Conference Board survey, this reading hasn't declined quite as fast as it increased in the 19 months leading up to the peak, but at -0.2, it is still below its historical average dating back to 2010 and back down to levels it was at right before the COVID shock hit the economy in early 2020.

> # Home Prices Bounce in Hardest Hit Areas

> March data on home prices across the country were released today with updated S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller numbers. Case Shiller home prices had been falling rapidly in many of the twenty cities tracked, but in March we actually saw a pretty big month-over-month bounce in some of the hardest-hit areas like San Diego, San Francisco, LA, Denver, and Phoenix. Some cities still saw declines, however. Las Vegas saw a m/m drop of 0.93%, while Miami fell 0.41%, and Seattle fell 0.28%.

> On a year-over-year basis, Miami is still up the most with a gain of 10.86%. As shown in the table below, Miami home prices are up 59.87% from pre-COVID levels in February 2020, and they're only down 2.9% from post-COVID highs. Only Tampa is up more than Miami from pre-COVID levels (+61.04%), but Tampa prices are down more from their post-COVID highs (-4.70%) than Miami (-2.90%).

> Four cities are down more than 10% from their post-COVID highs: San Diego (-10.12%), Las Vegas (-10.95%), San Francisco (-16.35%), and Seattle (-16.50%). New York is down the least from post-COVID highs of any city tracked at just -2.9%.

We've included a vertical red line on each chart to highlight pre-COVID levels. When looking through the charts, you can see this month's small bounce back in most cities after a 6-9 month pullback in prices from peaks seen early last year.

106,The Big Bang? Maybe community voting + an open source AI ?,20,xjo70y,https://i.redd.it/i2ijqcf5m3p91.png,20,1663716641.0,
107,Better Buy: Shopify vs. Fiverr International,19,13qcug9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13qcug9/better_buy_shopify_vs_fiverr_international/,28,1684907456.0,"Which of these disruptive platforms is a better long-term investment?

  
Shopify (SHOP -6.01%) and Fiverr International (FVRR -1.39%) both challenge the status quo for selling goods and services. Shopify's e-commerce services enable smaller merchants to set up their own online stores, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their marketing campaigns without joining a crowded online marketplace like Amazon. Meanwhile, Fiverr is a gig economy marketplace that hosts hundreds of categories of writing, coding, media, marketing, and design jobs.  
  
Shopify and Fiverr both saw their stocks hit all-time highs during the buying frenzy in meme and growth stocks throughout 2021. But as of this writing, Shopify and Fiverr trade about 64% and 91%, respectively, below those frothy levels.  
  
Both stocks lost their luster as investors fretted over their slowing growth in a post-pandemic market. Rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth tech stocks.

**Shopify's post-pandemic slowdown could be ending**

  
Shopify's revenue surged 86% in 2020 and grew 57% in 2021 as the pandemic drove more merchants to open online stores and more customers to shop online. Its adjusted net income also jumped 1,332% in 2020 and rose 66% in 2021.

But in 2022, Shopify's revenue only grew 21% as its adjusted net income plunged 94%. Its growth cooled off as the pandemic passed, and it ramped up its spending to expand its lower-margin Shop Pay and logistics businesses. Its acquisitions of 6 River Systems and Deliverr -- which were both aimed at expanding its logistics network -- also crushed its operating margins. That combination of slowing growth and rising costs drove a lot of bulls away from Shopify.

However, Shopify's revenue rose 25% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, and the company unexpectedly announced it would sell its entire logistics division to Flexport in exchange for a 13% stake in the private company. It also plans to lay off approximately 20% of its workforce to complement that divestment and stabilize its operating margins.  
  
Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise about 20% this year as its adjusted EPS soars 675%. That stable outlook suggests it's reached the trough of its cyclical slowdown. Despite all those improvements, Shopify still faces intense competition from other similar services like Amazon's ""Buy with Prime"" buttons for independent merchants, Adobe Commerce, and BigCommerce -- and all that pressure could erode its pricing power and squeeze its gross margins.  
  
**Fiverr's growth is still decelerating**

  
Fiverr's revenue surged 77% in 2020 and rose 57% in 2021 as the pandemic drove more people to accept freelance and contract work. It also turned profitable on an adjusted basis in 2020, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 152% in 2021.

But in 2022, Fiverr's revenue and adjusted net income only rose 13% and 7%, respectively. In 2023, it expects its revenue to rise a mere 5% to 8% -- but it expects its adjusted EBITDA to roughly double as it reins in its spending.

As Fiverr's growth cools off, it faces longer-term concerns about ChatGPT and similar generative artificial intelligence (AI) services displacing a wide range of freelance jobs. CEO Micha Kaufman tried to allay those concerns during the company's latest conference call by saying that it doesn't ""anticipate AI development to displace the need for human talent."" Instead, Kaufman suggested the AI boom will drive a growing need for more freelance AI work for humans -- such as ""verifying and editing"" AI-generated content.  
  
Fiverr also recently launched a dedicated AI services category for those positions. However, Fiverr's growth could stay sluggish for the foreseeable future -- and it still faces intense competition from similar freelance platforms like Upwork.  
  
**The valuations and verdict**

  
Shopify and Fiverr's valuations cooled off a lot after their steep drawdowns. Shopify trades at 11 times this year's sales, while Fiverr trades at just 3 times this year's sales. Meanwhile, Shopify is pricer because brighter days seem right around the corner, while Fiverr seems cheaper because its downturn could easily last for at least another year.

I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. But if I had to pick one, I'd definitely buy Shopify because it's growing faster, it's making tough calls to streamline its business, and it shouldn't be disrupted by the rise of generative AI platforms.  
  
Fiverr could remain a top destination for gig economy workers, but I'm not fully convinced it's immune to the generative AI revolution -- which could easily disrupt a wide range of jobs across the writing, coding, media, and design industries."
108,Goldman Sachs also embraces AI after Big Morgan: uses GPT-like technology to help developers write code,19,11z64e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11z64e9/goldman_sachs_also_embraces_ai_after_big_morgan/,18,1679539316.0,"Goldman Sachs emphasized that AI should not be seen as a replacement for software developers, but more as a partner to help them be more productive. In some cases, developers have been able to use generative AI to automate up to 40 percent of their code, Goldman said.

Wall Street is embracing artificial intelligence.

&#x200B;

After Morgan Stanley tapped into GPT-4 and will use AI technology to optimize its wealth management advisory process, Goldman Sachs has also started using ChatGPT-like AI software to assist developers in writing code internally.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, March 21, Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti said Goldman Sachs developers are testing generative AI tools internally to help them write code. He said it is currently in the ""proof-of-concept"" stage and is not yet ready for production.

&#x200B;

Argenti said on Tuesday:

&#x200B;

Goldman Sachs developers are already using some assistive coding techniques.

&#x200B;

Goldman Sachs' interest in generative AI products remains, despite opposition from some banking giants to internal use of ChatGPT by employees. That includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America, which have all restricted employees from using the software at work.

&#x200B;

Argenti said:

&#x200B;

This technology is still in its early stages. We're not going to let this technology do all the most important work right away, but it's imperative that we really try it and understand its potential.

&#x200B;

I've been working with technology for almost 40 years, and this is one of the biggest disruptions I've ever seen - probably comparable to the Internet, apps, cloud computing.

&#x200B;

He emphasized that AI should be seen less as a replacement for software developers and more as a partner to help them be more productive. In some cases, he said, developers have been able to write up to 40 percent of their code automatically using generative AI.

&#x200B;

It's not just Goldman Sachs that has embraced AI technology, but Morgan Stanley as well.

&#x200B;

Last week, OpenAI unveiled six use cases when it released GPT-4, including one in which Morgan Stanley's wealth management division (MSWM) used GPT-4 to organize the mobilization of its client-facing knowledge base.

&#x200B;

For its part, Morgan Stanley also said that it is currently ""the only strategic wealth management client to have early access to OpenAI's new product"" and that its wealth management division will use GPT-4 to ""acquire, process and synthesize content in the form of global company, industry, asset class, capital market and regional insights that will be incorporated into MSWM. in the form of insights into global companies, industries, asset classes, capital markets and regions, drawing on MSWM's own extensive intellectual capital.""

## 🖍️ Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Are Finger-Lickin' Good

Gawrsh, folks! Let's talk about how we can predict the tastiest crayon colors using some fancy-shmancy technical analysis and indicator-based trading. 📈🌈

You see, we're gonna use the current option open interest to calculate some big ol' numbers called portfolio-level greeks, like Delta and Gamma. Then we'll simulate how these greeks change at different price points, and find the levels where the gamma is the highest and the delta is close to 0. 📊

Sometimes, the price of our crayons reacts strongly to these levels, and that's what we'll use to drive our trading signals. 📡

Now, the plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which helps us figure out the expected size and duration of the reactions. Most of these plays are profitable, but the best ones benefit from the directional move and the increase in IV. 🎯

## 📝 Notes - Wrinkles and All
If the price has moved past the entry price, be careful! Make sure to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest. I usually risk up to 1% of my total capital on trades, but if I'm less confident, I'll allocate less and dollar cost average in. And remember, the trades are based on info up to yesterday, so new price movements might change the whole game. 🔄

## ❓ FAQ - 'Cause Y'all Keep Askin'
**Q:** Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? 🐻\
**A:** Nope! It just so happens that the companies are overextended, so these trades are mean-reverting.

**Q:** Are you entering all these plays? 🤔\
**A:** No siree! I'm just sharin' more plays with a probable edge to help you apes find more gain porn. 🦍💰

**Q:** What if you mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past? 🎢\
**A:** The new play should replace the old one. Don't chase the price, and remember that new data changes things.

**Q:** Where are the crayons? I only see words. 🖍️\
**A:** Click the links above, partner!

**Q:** Have you back-tested this? 🧪\
**A:** Yup! Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and a 63% win rate (±7% margin of error).

**Q:** What's the historical performance? 📜\
**A:** The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28) 📅

So, folks, that's the scoop on how we can find the tastiest crayons in the box! Now go out there, do your own research, and get that gain porn! 🚀🌕"

*****
> The Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by a vote of 314-117 with bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he hopes “we can move the bill quickly here in the Senate and bring it to the president’s desk as soon as possible.”

114,ChatGPT's soaring popularity has added $5 billion to the wealth of Nvidia's founder as Wall Street bets on AI boom for the chipmaker,17,10qzemi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10qzemi/chatgpts_soaring_popularity_has_added_5_billion/,8,1675270075.0,"With the rise of OpenAI's language tool, ChatGPT, Wall Street traders are increasingly betting on chip-makers like Nvidia, which has climbed more than 34% this month.

As a result, CEO Jensen Huang, who cofounded the company in 1993, has seen his wealth balloon by more than a third to $18.9 billion. 

According to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, the $5.1 billion gain gives Huang the largest percentage gain to his net-worth among US billionaires so far this year. 

The 59-year-old Taiwanese immigrant is coming off a less memorable year, as he was among other tech moguls who lost big money, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk.

Microsoft this month reportedly invested $10 billion into ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, which has fueled interest in the artificial intelligence space overall. The bot has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages.

Nvidia's role as a dominant player in the chip-making space has made it an attractive bet as Wall Street looks to ride the AI trend.

After starting initially with graphics chips used in video games, the company is now involved in making chips for AI applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robots. 

Last week, Citi strategists estimated that ChatGPT's growth could result in sales of $3 billion to $11 billion for Nvidia over the course of a year, per Bloomberg.

Nvidia (NVDA) is currently up almost 3% as OpenAI's popular language tool, ChatGPT, has spurred investors to bet on AI, which has led them to chip companies. Do you think it is now time to buy NVDA for long term?"

The latest Markit PMI for the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to above the 50 mark in April, and rose to 53.7 in April, with the services PMI rising instead of falling to new highs since October last year and April last year, respectively. Strong demand supported a general expansion in business activity in the US manufacturing and services sectors in April, but also revived inflation that had cooled earlier in the year. Chris Williamson, an economist at S&P Global, commented that the upturn in demand was also accompanied by renewed price pressures, with CPI likely to rise, or at least remain somewhat elevated.

**Money is flooding into US stock ETFs as Wall Street issues back-to-back warnings**

A number of Wall Street investment banks have recently issued warnings that the rally in US stocks is doomed to fail and a crash is imminent, but investors seem to be choosing to ignore this. In April alone, more than US$12.6 billion flowed into US traded index funds (ETF), the largest inflow since January, with US$5.2 billion flowing in February and US$3.1 billion in March.

**Moody's downgrades 11 banks after another outflow of US bank deposits**

Seasonally adjusted data released by the Federal Reserve on Friday showed that US bank deposits fell by US$76.2 billion to US$17.2 trillion in the week ended April 12, compared with US$17.3 trillion in the previous week. Outflows were mainly seen at large banks and foreign institutions, but deposits at smaller banks also recorded a decline. On the same day, ratings agency Moody's downgraded 11 regional banks, including U.S. Hopewell, Bank of Hawaii, Zions, Western Alliance and First Republic Bank.

**At least nine lawmakers sell bank shares amid US banking turmoil**

Last month, the US banking crisis triggered turmoil in the financial markets. According to media reports, at least nine members of the US Congress sold off bank stocks before and during the market turmoil in March. According to the reports, New Jersey Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer disclosed that he sold $1,000-$15,000 worth of Silicon Valley Bank shares on 9 March. The day after his sale (March 10), Silicon Valley Bank was declared to have collapsed and taken over by the FDIC, triggering a massive plunge in US bank stocks.

**Google merges AI chip team into cloud computing unit to catch up with Microsoft and Amazon**

$Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://GOOGL.US))$ has reportedly shifted its team dedicated to AI chip development to its cloud division. It is reported that Google is making this adjustment mainly because it wants to enhance the competitiveness of its cloud computing team to catch up with its strong rivals Amazon Cloud and Microsoft Cloud. Google will integrate its two AI R&D labs, DeepMind and Google Brain, to strengthen the company's AI division.

**Tesla's market capitalisation slashes in a year as Musk is denounced by a coalition of shareholders**

On Friday, EST, 17 institutional shareholders of Tesla joined together to issue an open letter to the $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://TSLA.US))$ board, saying that CEO Musk is distracted by other companies and must be reined in. The investors pointed out that Tesla's market capitalisation has shrunk badly over the past year, with its current market capitalisation being only half of its $1.2 trillion market capitalisation on April 4 last year. And what upsets Tesla's shareholders most is that Musk is distracted too much from the operations of other companies. The 17 institutional shareholders together hold more than $1.5 billion worth of Tesla stock.

**Lyft plans job cuts that could affect 30% of its workforce**

Ride-hailing company $Lyft Inc ([LYFT.US](https://LYFT.US))$ plans to implement a new round of job cuts, eliminating 1,200 or more positions. This round of layoffs could affect 30% or more of the company's workforce, which numbers more than 4,000 employees. The company plans to announce the move after next week's board meeting.

**The key financial events and data for this week (4.24-4.28) are as follows:**

*In terms of economic data, the US will release the core PCE price index for March, the preliminary annualised quarterly rate of US real GDP for the first quarter and the US initial jobless claims for the week to April 22, among other heavyweight data coming out.*

*The earnings season is culminating with a number of heavyweight earnings reports coming in. In the US, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and Intel are set to announce their earnings reports. The report card of technology stocks is crucial for the whole market, as the 7 percentage point gain of the S&P 500 in the first quarter was mainly driven by a handful of technology giants*

**On the basis of the above data, I personally believe that the focus this week is on the earnings report and plan based on the performance of the earnings report**"
116,How I see the Future Economic Landscape - A few points to consider and ponder.,14,12cmumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12cmumr/how_i_see_the_future_economic_landscape_a_few/,24,1680706249.0,"# Future Economic Landscape

I believe that the world is heading to an inflationary regime (which can last decades). But that doesn’t mean it will be inflationary throughout, there will be periods of disinflation, deflation, and reinflation peppered within this inflationary regime, just like how we had a deflationary regime over the last four decades that was peppered with periods of disinflation, deflation, and reinflation.

**So why are we heading to an inflationary regime?**

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the deflationary drivers of the last four decades** – 

1.**China** – managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today.

2.**Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe.

3.**Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China.

4.**Female Labor Force Participation** – increased participation of women in the labor force, especially in China.

5.**Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down.

6.**Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model whilst increasing revenues. It also led to increased competition and the emergence of massively disruptive startups.

7.**Technology** – the ultimate deflationary driver which made the world smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, boosted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially.

**Now let us understand which of the above deflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** – 

1.**China** – demography is getting older and wealthier. Cheap labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are already moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh, as China isn’t feasible for cheap labor anymore.

2.**Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity. Reshoring of jobs and supply chains will be inflationary.

3.**Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have mandates in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.

4.**Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the electorate, leading to more fiscal policy solutions, which makes the economy inflationary.

**Apart from the drivers listed above which can turn from deflationary to inflationary, a new set of inflationary drivers can also be witnessed.**

**The new drivers of an Inflationary Regime**

1.**ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock for existing sources of energy as enough new investments weren’t being made. This leads to higher prices for existing sources of energy. New ESG projects require mega capex. Without public investment in ESG, private investment would not be enough to scale or bring down the costs to the end consumer. This either means that private investment bears the loss, increase prices, or the governments subsidize the private investment to bring down the costs to the end user. If private investments have to bear a loss, then investing in ESG wouldn’t be attractive to them, if ESG projects have to increase prices to be profitable, then they may not be feasible to consumers, and if the governments introduce subsidies for private ESG investments, then they would exacerbate the debt problem.

2.**Inequality** – the deflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation.

3.**Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy along with monetary policy is proven to be inflationary.

**But because I have a view on an inflationary regime that doesn’t mean it will actually play out. There are still factors that would be a risk to an inflationary regime and lead to the deflationary regime from the last 4 decades to continue for another few decades.**

**The risks to the drivers of an Inflationary Regime**

1. **Technology** – it could continue to be a deflationary driver and would be enough to replace the labor force exiting the market. These technologies could be AI, robotics, 3D printing, etc.

2. **India & Africa** – although they lack the administrative infrastructure present in China to develop a similar market scale, they could still be a new source for cheap labor.

3. **Female Labor Force Participation** – in countries such as India where the female labor force participation is low, an increase in the participation rate can be a deflationary driver.

4. **Weakening JPY** – the continued weakening of the JPY against the USD can make Japan more competitive in the export market, making it a serious competitor to China. However, to stay relevant, China will be forced to devalue its currency, exporting deflation to the world in the process. Although, the BoJ can stop the JPY from weakening further, but that would mean giving up the YCC, which seems difficult as of now because that would lead to a lot of their domestic institutions and funds failing as they own a lot of the JGB’s. Apart from that, increasing yields in Japan would mean lesser liquidity in the global markets, which could possibly lead to higher yields worldwide. Considering these risks, it seems more likely that Japan would let the JPY weaken as per market forces, which in turn would force the hand of China.

5. **Underestimating China** \- having a tight grip over the country, establishing policies and new laws to make sure prices stay low, won’t be difficult for China. Apart from that, the costs involved in building new supply chains and infrastructure to move away from China, may prove difficult to the world, considering this would require new investments, which would mean a higher debt burden than already exists.

  

**A few other thoughts on the Future Economic Landscape**

1. Governments would be more focused on spending to reduce inequality rather than investing in alternative energy because fiscal stimulus would win votes as that’s money directly in the hands of people.

2. Monetary policy alone would be frowned upon by the electorate and hence fiscal policy would also be required. Monetary and fiscal policy together, are known to be inflationary.

3. PE, VC, and other alternative investments can become risky as liquidity moves out. Liquidity is moving out because treasury yields worldwide are rising and institutional investors who moved to alternative assets in search of yields, are moving out. Treasury yields move higher when inflation moves higher. Not to forget that if JPY keeps going higher, the BoJ will have to give up on the YCC, thus increasing JGB yields, and taking away liquidity from international markets, which in turn can hurt alternative investments all the more. Alternative investments already are under pressure because of lower valuations due to higher interest rates or discount rates, and taking away liquidity means difficulty in finding buyers for existing investors or lower exit valuations. Keeping this in mind, investors should be more stringent with investments in startups or loss making entities.

117,"The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?",13,13yhq75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yhq75/the_future_picks_and_shovels_of_ai_may_not_be/,3,1685724118.0,"For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now. 

I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.

Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.  

Years ago, a paper titled ""Attention is all you need"" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.  

Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy. 

Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs."

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
> Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
> Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
> The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
> The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
> However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool.
*****
> He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
> “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.
*****
> The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they’re relaying to the public.
*****
> “No matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‘communicate’ what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,” Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
> “When markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

# [Stock futures fall as traders await debt ceiling progress in Washington: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were lower Wednesday as investors kept an eye on the federal debt ceiling debate in Washington ahead of the final trading day of May.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 33 points, or about 0.1%. S&P 500 futures slid 0.15%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were down 0.17%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after a muted day of trading on Tuesday that saw the Dow shed about 50 points while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3%.
*****
> Heading into the final trading day of May, the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 6.5% for the month. The S&P 500, however, is up only about 0.9%, while the Dow has fallen 3.1%.
*****
> The outperformance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq is due in large part to the excitement around artificial intelligence, which briefly pushed Nvidia’s market cap above $1 trillion on Tuesday. However, many on Wall Street are worried that the market’s strength has been too narrow.
*****
> “We’re not seeing any signs of broad participation. We’re not seeing signs of early cyclicals on top of A.I.,” said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors in Dallas.
*****
> One factor that has weighed on the market in recent weeks is the fight over the debt ceiling. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced a deal over the weekend to cap federal baseline spending for two years and raise the debt ceiling, but the agreement has not yet been ratified.
*****
> The deal cleared a major test Tuesday night after advancing to the House floor following a 7-6 vote in the House Rules Committee. The floor vote is expected to take place around 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.
*****
> “I think we have the votes to pass this today,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry, a GOP negotiator on the debt deal, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday morning.

121,Market Recap - 5/1/23 - 700 million dollars per AI,14,13f33e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13f33e3/market_recap_5123_700_million_dollars_per_ai/,9,1683846030.0,"&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/13f33e3/video/lf37boo8z9za1/player

**The Fed**

Initial jobless claim jumped to 245K much higher than expected and highest since Oct 2021. Initial claim claim increased slightly to 1.8MM. 

https://preview.redd.it/a6fdil5jz9za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0f5308cd21ba78401b1614f89e20a2bfd80af421

However, from a historical perspective, total jobless claims currently represent only 1.24% of the entire labor force. Historical data shows that recessions typically begin when jobless claims at least 2% or more. Therefore, the current level of jobless claims is not yet a cause for concern. 

https://preview.redd.it/8618f1f10aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=030d4b5ae908fab1c3b1ec63eabbb29d7ff452f9

We will likely to see initial claims continue to climb in the coming months as historically rate hikes leads initial claims growth. Fed is not going to be concerned at this level and probably welcome a slightly loose jobs market. 

https://preview.redd.it/67s04ipq0aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ad5cb0efb1050f09aa1f54559d3877a37576640

Liz Young: S&P 500 company mentions of layoffs continued to rise in April and are now at the highest in two years.

https://preview.redd.it/7a0x672t0aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e27826999cd9c1dc0ec8933e2b2a8951d5780c22

COMERICA: “Jobless claims show a small margin of slack is opening up in the labor market .. the direction for unemployment is very likely higher over the next six months .. The Fed is more likely to start cutting interest rates later this year than hold them unchanged into 2024.”

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released April data showing that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand rose by 0.2 percent, lower than the anticipated 0.3 percent. This follows a decline of 0.4 percent in March and no change in February. On a year-over-year basis, PPI increased by 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. The slowdown was primarily driven by a decrease in demand for energy (-8% YoY) and transportation & warehousing for goods (-5.1% YoY).

https://preview.redd.it/5jgtzc7z0aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63fe18131baf24a79431a482cd17fe46915873e7

Note that CPI is higher than PPI by 3%. Corporates are making good money on expanding margins. The inflation will last as long as people can still afford it.

More government spending coming than Fed can roll off their balance sheet. Bullish for stonks.

https://preview.redd.it/0txn993c1aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=240762bf3b303b46021adf04281629d33c4bc208

The consumer debt delinquency rate is increasing, although it remains below pre-pandemic levels. However, the rate is rising rapidly. Nothing to worry about now but definitely worth to keep an eye on.

**The Economy**

Copper took a nose dive today, signaling growing concerns about global demand, particularly from China.

As mentioned yesterday regarding the slowdown in retail traffic, the latest Redbook Sales data confirms a continued decline in consumer spending. According to Redbook sales, consumer spending recorded its slowest pace of growth since February 2021 last week.

https://preview.redd.it/zeev3cak2aza1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b5d2358ab6be80260c31b43207fdb8098c3faa5d

**The Business**

Google has added over $100 billion to its market capitalization after unveiled new AI-centered features tied to Gmail and Workspace as its annual developers conference, Google I/O. 'AI' was mentioned over 140 times in its 2-hour Google I/O keynote. That's over 700 million dollars per ""AI"".

PacWest stock plunged 23% after it said it lost 9.5% of deposit last week. They actually reported no deposit losses on May 3rd but the stock selloff scared the depositors and they lost 9.5% in 2 days (May 4-5). Like I mentioned in the weekend post, there is no rational in fear. This kind of self-reinforcing deposit outflow will likely to continue from one bank to another.

However, banks today maintain significantly higher levels of liquidity compared to pre-pandemic times and even during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As long as there is no substantial decrease in the value of collateral assets  (like what happened to T-bills and office loans), the banking system remains fundamentally strong.

https://preview.redd.it/rd67lwdg5aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64ea70d9ce6577313f45e567a01bb46994f14d22

I added a couple of ""Small Growth"" stocks (with a strong cash balance and lower PS ratio than before the pandemic) to my portfolio today (ZS and DDOG). As I have mentioned a couple of times, I think these stocks can thrive in a slow growth low interest rate environment. My other positions have not changed.

# Stratasys and Desktop Metal to merge and flip Nano Dimension the bird

  
On May 25th, 2023, Stratasys and Desktop Metal announced a proposed **all-stock merger** that has been in the works for over a year *(as per remarks in the joint call)*. **Desktop Metal stockholders will receive 0.123 ordinary shares of Stratasys for each share of Desktop Metal** Class A common stock. The purchase consideration implies a **premium of 7.4%** to Desktop Metal's May 24th closing price of $1.75 to Stratasys's May 24th closing price of $14.88. Stratasys shareholders will own approximately 59% of the combined company, and Desktop Metal stockholders will hold about 41%. The combination will **strengthen the balance sheets**, provide even **greater synergies and cost reductions**, and the **complementary portfolio** of the two entities' solutions show little to no overlap - **creating the undisputed and largest industry** leader in the additive manufacturing space. Following on from **Stratasys's achievement of profitability** and **Desktop Metal's projection to reach adj.EBITDA breakeven in Q3 or Q4**, the joint entity forecasts **revenue of $1.1B by 2025**.   


Less than one hour after the announcement, **Nano Dimension announced** its fourth unsolicited tender offer in an **attempt to acquire Stratasys in a hostile takeover**. *“As we had previously indicated to the Stratasys Board, given their continued refusal to engage in negotiations, we have decided to present our offer directly to Stratasys’ shareholders,”* [said Yoav Stern](https://investors.nano-di.com/press-releases/news-details/2023/Nano-Dimension-Launches-18.00-Per-Share-All-Cash-Special-Tender-Offer-to-Increase-Ownership-in-Stratasys-to-between-53-and-55-of-Its-Outstanding-Shares/default.aspx), Nano Dimension’s Chairman and CEO. Indeed, a quick glance at Nano's press releases, social media and conference calls reveals **a tirade of slander, misinformation and hostilities toward Stratasys**.  Unsurprisingly **this was met with a fourth rejection** from the board, [who cited](https://assets.website-files.com/646d3ff4f45630efe69682f1/6475f000bec55dc42ede16a4_Stratasys%20Board%20of%20Directors%20Unanimously%20Rejects%20Nano%20Dimension’s%20Partial%20Tender%20Offer.pdf) the **questionable legality, morality   and motives of Nano**. This comes at a time when **Nano Dimension is already in deep legal trouble with its investors**, namely Murchison. According to Murchinson, the meeting saw **92% of the votes cast supported Murchinson’s proposal to remove four directors from the Nano board, including Yoav Stern, Chief Executive Officer** and Chairman of Nano Dimension.

At the same time as this rejection, **Desktop Metal** [announced](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/151/desktop-metal-inc-adopts-limited-duration-shareholder) a **temporary poison pill** which expires either in mid-2024 or upon completion of the merger. Given that **Stratasys already has one** in place and there would be **no way for Nano to acquire Stratasys** without unsolicited shareholder offers *(which are extremely unlikely to succeed).*  Desktop Metal's temporary poison pill filing is therefore a safety measure to prevent Nano from enacting a hostile takeover or causing interference with the merger.   


**Despite** a significant amount of **cash and equivalents totalling over $1B** on hand and some pretty cool tech operating in a highly important market, **Nano Dimension's revenue has been a paltry $43.6M for FY2022**, and even that represents 316% growth and a 1,200% YoY. Sadly it seems that despite much interest over the last few years **Nano Dimension is ultimately a company with no viability and incredibly poor leadership** who have steered the company into the ground. Given that **Nano also have a poison pill, this unfortunately means they could not be acquired themselves** and therefore the writing is on the wall. 

# Draaaamaaaaa! So, what does this mean for the valuation? 

&#x200B;

Given the merger being all-stock, Desktop Metal shareholders will receive 0.123 Stratasys shares per 1 Desktop Metal share. Stratasys currently has 68.4M shares outstanding, and therefore this would create 39.53M new shares to create a grand total of 107.93M shares outstanding.   


In 2025 the joint entity forecasts revenue of $1.1B with a margin 10-12% (totalling $110M+ profit). Using the average multiple of 20x, this would place the valuation at **$2.2B by 2025 - equating to $20.37 per share**. The AM 2.0 industry is expected to grow to $100B by 2030 assuming a 25%CAGR, and the combined entity still expects to capture at least 10% market share. This would place revenue at $10B in 2030 and profit of $1B using the 10-12% margin given. The average forward multiple for a stock is 20-25x, placing the valuation at **$20B with the stock price at $185.12 in 2030 as a base case**. Given the unforeseen global events of the past three years, even implying a time-based discount of 30% (i.e, roughly three years behind schedule) still puts the shares price at roughly $130. Assuming both Desktop Metal and Stratasys continue to deliver on their promises, increase margins and capture a higher portion of the market by 2030, I predict that the **shares could be worth upwards of $555 assuming a 30% market share in the bull case**. 

Given the increasing demand for AM 2.0 solutions and backing by various national entities such as the [US Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/05/09/using-additive-manufacturing-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience-and-bolster-small-and-mid-size-firms/) during a time where supply times are being reevaluated and re-shored, I believe that the time for 3D printing to dominate is upon us. With existing customers as the two companies already have, it is not a matter of 'if' but 'when'. 

# What's the trade? 

  
Well, there's lots of ways to play this.   


Personally I am continuing to go long with my position in Desktop Metal on the basis that profitability is reached by the end of the year - regardless of the merger proposal. In my opinion, there is profound upside here should the deal go through or not. Average analyst estimate is currently $2.50 and the shares currently trade at $1.84 around significant support. I believe that should Desktop Metal announce profitability at some point in Q3 where the apex of the downtrend lies (August) there could be a significant and sustained pop in the stock up to around $5. Personally I feel that this is where the opportunity lies, and where the growth post-merger is overwhelmingly going to come from. I'd consider shares or LEAPs over short-term options to allow a margin of error.   


Due to ongoing hostilities with Nano Dimension I would be unlikely to consider opening a trade in Stratasys for  more than $8, particularly given inconsistencies in their profitability. I would prefer to wait and observe developments in these areas. Should Stratasys release consecutive positive quarters I would certainly reconsider my evaluations.   


Nano Dimension in my opinion could be an easy short when things inevitably deteriorate with Murchison and Yoav in court, but that's not a game I play.

I currently put about 80% of my saving each month (About 4100 USD) to S&P500 (VOO) and the last 20% are divided between multiple technology stocks, mostly Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and AMD (very original, I know). Recently I thought of dividing the last 20% differently and giving 10-15% to 1 company that I believe in instead of dividing it between them ""randomly"" as I did until now, and I thought of Google for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

\* AI - I use AI technologies and ChatGPT daily. I think that while Google are currently behind, they will eventually catch up and be a leader in the sector. They show impressive advancements recently, and not only that there are signs that they are leading the sector in other areas, like physical robots (Like the awesome video where they play soccer/football). On the other hand, Microsoft bought their usage of AI and rely almost entirely on OpenAI to advance the field for them, which is risky and might lead to many issues in the long run.

\* Quantum computing - This market is clearly going to change the world when it becomes mainstream, and Google is currently a leader in the area. They continue developing and researching in the field and continue to show progress, including this year.A combination of advancing in AI in the shorter term and being a strong company in quantum computing in the long run leads me to believe that Google might be a good investment for the long run, possibly more than other technology companies.

Of course I am 100% aware that no one can perdict he future and don't intend to put everything in one basket, but I still wonder what your thoughts are, and if I should put more into Google than other tech companies."

# Market Momentum Pauses as AI-Fueled Rally Steadies; Investors Eye Congressional Debt Deal

**May 30th Recap**

The stock market's momentum stalled after a dramatic rally, driven by the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence technologies, catapulted the market to its loftiest heights since August. Treasury yields dipped in anticipation of the U.S. Congress passing a resolution to avert a debt default.

The S&P 500 barely budged in trading, holding its ground just north of the 4,200 mark. With oil prices sliding below the $70 per barrel threshold, energy firms emerged as the drag on the index. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 continued its upward trajectory for the year, posting a robust 31% gain. Nvidia, a leader in the AI sector, hovered near the $1 trillion valuation mark following the unveiling of several AI-centric products. Blue-chip stocks such as Apple and Tesla also made notable strides, advancing over 1.5%.

On the bond front, U.S. yields retreated from their March peak as investors sized up the likely economic fallout from the recent agreement to temporarily lift the federal debt ceiling over the holiday weekend, along with an anticipated surge of month-end buying.

Treasury notes with maturities spanning 3 to 10 years were at the forefront of this downward trend. The two-year yield, typically more responsive to Federal Reserve policy changes projections than its longer-term counterparts, hovered around the 4.5% mark.

**SPY Emerges from Accumulation Phase, Enters Redistribution's First Stage: Bears Eye Tomorrow's Market for 2nd Redistribution Stage**

SPY drew buy-side interest at 420.89 and saw accumulation at the day's top. Following this, it shifted lower, erasing sell-side liquidity at 419.78 and 419.05, effectively completing the first redistribution phase. This could signal a new trend in SPY's market behavior.

# Understanding The Economic Vital Signs of Texas

Business indicators serve as the economy's vital signs. They provide a real-time glimpse into the health of a region's economy. A recent analysis of Texas' economy paints a mixed picture. While certain indicators such as production, capacity utilization, new orders, and the growth rate of orders are trending down, others are showing surprising resilience​.

**The Current State of Affairs**

A noticeable trend is the rise in finished goods inventories. This could suggest that Texas businesses are anticipating a surge in demand. Alternatively, it might be a signal that goods are not selling as quickly as expected, an indicator of a potential slowdown in consumer activity​.

At the same time, data shows a decrease in prices paid for raw materials, prices received for finished goods, and wages and benefits. This could imply tighter margins for businesses in the near future, which might put pressure on profitability​.

**Looking Forward**

Future projections provide mixed signals. Predictions point to increases in production, capacity utilization, shipments, and employment in the next six months. This could suggest a potential rebound in the economic activities of the region​.

However, the future might not be all rosy. Anticipated decreases in new orders, the growth rate of orders, unfilled orders, delivery time, finished goods inventories, prices paid for raw materials, hours worked, and capital expenditures could suggest challenging times ahead​.

A key point of concern is the projected decrease in capital expenditures (CapEx). If Texas businesses are less willing or able to invest in their future growth, it could have a significant impact on the state's long-term economic vitality​.

**Concluding Thoughts**

In conclusion, the business climate in Texas appears to be a mixed bag. While there are reasons for optimism, such as projected increases in production and employment, there are also reasons for concern. As always, a balanced and nuanced understanding of these indicators is necessary when making business decisions or forecasting economic trends​.

For those interested in a more detailed analysis of the state's manufacturing sector, the [Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tmos/2023/2305#tab-results) provides further insights. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the state's factory activity, which is a crucial component of Texas' economy.

# Catch the Market Pulse: Unraveling the Oscillations Between External and Internal Liquidity

The market moves from the external liquidity range to the internal liquidity range and back to the external liquidity range.

1. **External to Internal**: At the start of a trading period, the market may be at an extreme range where external liquidity is high. This could be a point where many stop orders (buy-side for downtrends, sell-side for uptrends) are placed. As these stop orders are hit, they generate trades that move the market away from the extreme towards the internal range.
2. **Internal Liquidity Phase**: Once the market moves into the internal range, trades occur within this range. During this phase, new buy & sell orders populate the range, and market maker buy & sell models form inside the range. This phase is characterized by liquidity voids and fair value gaps filling in.
3. **Internal to External**: After some time, the market might move towards the other extreme of the range, where the opposite type of stop orders (sell-side for downtrends, buy-side for uptrends) are placed, representing high external liquidity. The hitting of these stop orders then pushes the market back towards the internal range, and the cycle repeats.

*Here is an example of the ES based on today’s price action. Study the chart. Add the levels. Note how the market has moved into the internal liquidity phase after completing the external liquidity phase.*

We are also near the top range of the bullish uptrend on the RSI. It does have room to run, but, to me, the H1 chart looks bearish to me, and it’s unlikely that we will form a new high tomorrow

Alphabet shares slid as much as 9% during regular trading with volumes nearly three times the 50-day moving average. They pared losses after hours and were roughly flat. The stock had lost 40% of its value last year but rallied 15% since the beginning of this year, excluding Wednesday's losses.

Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system. 

Google has been on its heels after OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. 

Google's live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated.

Bard's error was discovered just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California.

""While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo.""

As anticipated, Wall Street's opening was a mixed bag, echoing the fluctuating futures. Shares in the real sector and banks are down, whereas technology and semiconductor manufacturers' stocks are enjoying a healthy boost. The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.

What's happening with NVIDIA?

Despite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.

In my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.

However, **I believe this growth alone won't suffice to propel the market further**. Given the challenging economic conditions, I see a high probability of a market correction on the horizon.

Let's also consider some statistical data. U.S. GDP figures surpassed expectations, yet with the unresolved debt ceiling issue, this news has taken a back seat and will likely resonate later. And as for the initial U.S. jobless claims? No change there either, meaning there’s yet more to keep an eye on in the future.

What raises concern is that the **DXY is standing at 104.21 points**, and the **ten-year UST yield is at 3.77% per annum**, with **the two-year yield at an alarming 4.42%**! Meanwhile, **gold is trending downwards**. All in all, quite an intriguing scenario."

## 🎩 Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Have a Magical Flavor ✨

Darlings, let me tell you about the mystical world of technical analysis and indicator-based trading. They're like fortune tellers, using the past to predict the future! 🔮

Now, our magical analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that, we can calculate portfolio-level greeks—Delta and Gamma being the stars of the show. 🌟 Once we have those, we can simulate changes in greeks at different price points. This is where the real magic happens! ✨

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, or sometimes both. It's the reaction from these price levels in the past that drives our trading signals. 📈

Now, our plays and target entry prices are calculated using a binomial option pricing model, which reflects the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. Many of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock, and the best plays benefit from both the directional move and the increase in IV. 🎯

## 📜 Notes - A Wrinkle in Time

If the price has moved past the entry price, be cautious, my dear. Something has changed since these plays were generated. Remember to sell half your position on a double and freeroll the rest at your discretion. Risk up to 1% of your total capital on any trades you take, or less if your conviction is lower. And keep in mind that the trades were calculated before market open, so new price movement may invalidate the original thesis. 🌪️

## 🦉 FAQ - Wisdom from Madame Zeroni

* Are these plays mostly puts? Are you a gay bear? 🐻 No, darling. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays? 🎭 No, my child. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like, and get that gain porn. 🚀
* What about new plays on the same ticker? 🔄 The new play should replace the old play, as the old play is likely now invalid.
* Where are the crayons? 🖍️ Click the links above, sweetie.
* Have you back-tested this? 🧪 Yes, with a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76) and an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error).
* What is the historical performance? 📚 Realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 68% win rate. There's a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 63% and 75%. (Stats as of 2023-03-31) 📊

Now go forth, my darlings, and may the magic of the market be with you! 🔮✨"

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?"

**The Economy**

Germany officially entered a recession in Q1 2023, as the GDP was revised lower to -0.3%, following a 0.5% decline in Q4 2022. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Interestingly, despite the recession, the DAX reached an all-time high last week.

The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index is currently at its highest level in over a year. This indicates that economic data releases have been surpassing market expectations. As a result, the expectation of a recession keeps getting pushed back.

So many diverging signals this year. Here is another one: 10-year yield suggests booming growth, while the copper/gold ratio indicates a potential recession.

JPM, says stocks' risk-reward is 'poor,' recommends adding to cash and gold holdings.

BoA: “While a potential recession in 2H (house view) could put some pressure on the consensus 2H earnings recovery, we believe the downside risk will be mitigated given companies’ cost cuts. .. We thus raise our 2023 EPS forecast to $215 (-1% YoY) from $200.” (consensus $220)  BofA also initiates 2024 SPX EPS forecast of $235 (consensus $246).

This AI frenzy reminds me of the ""cloud"" trend from 2015 to 2018, and even 2019 before the COVID crash. The ""cloud kings"" (if anyone still remembers) experienced significant returns due to the real growth in cloud services and the widespread adoption of cloud technology. AI may very well be the next big thing. However, the risk is real too, as it could follow a similar path to the overheated dot com bubble or the underwhelming performance of the AR/VR Multiverse. Valuation aside, I am inclined to believe AI is here to stay and the potential is huge, as it is being adopted very broadly very quickly across various industries. What do you think?"

# [Stock futures rise slightly as investors await Fed rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed by 45 points, or 0.13%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.22% and 0.24%, respectively.
*****
> Ford Motor beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines in its latest quarter, as did coffee chain Starbucks. However, both stocks declined in the premarket.
*****
> The Fed is scheduled to release its latest policy announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Chair Jerome Powell is also set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.
*****
> Data from the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders are pricing in an 86% chance the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points. Wall Street will also look for clues on whether the central bank will continue its rate hiking campaign, or if it will pause increases.
*****
> The announcement will come after a rough session for the market. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Ongoing concerns of contagion in the regional banking sector weighed on markets following the First Republic Bank’s collapse and subsequent takeover by JPMorgan.
*****
> “There’s still pain throughout the sector,” iCapital’s Anastasia Amoroso said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “And the reason why I think the bank action should really matter to the Fed is because, remember, in the last FOMC meeting, Fed Chair Powell really gave us new metrics to watch in terms of whether they’re going to be raising rates or not. And that is the extent of the credit tightening that’s happening in the economy.”
*****
> Corporate earnings season continues with CVS Health, Yum Brands and Spirit AeroSystems reporting results Wednesday before the open.
*****
> On the economic front, traders are anticipating the latest ADP jobs data for April. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 133,000 jobs last month.
*****
> The S&P Global U.S. Services PMI data for April is also due. It’s expected to show a reading at 53.7 last month, which is in line with the prior month. April’s ISM non-manufacturing PMI data is forecasted to show 51.8, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That’s higher than the 51.2 reading from the previous month.

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
> The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
> Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
> One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

# [Dow futures are flat after failed First Republic is sold to JPMorgan: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/30/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-notches-best-month-since-january.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline Monday after the major averages logged gains for April, and traders assessed the takeover of failed bank First Republic.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow climbed 21 points, or 0.06%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.
*****
> The moves come after news that JPMorgan Chase has acquired all of troubled lender First Republic’s deposits and a “substantial majority of assets,” according to a release. JPMorgan’s shares rose 3% in premarket trading on the news.
*****
> “This takes away the uncertainty for the market,” Sarat Sethi, managing partner at DCLA, told CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange” on Monday. “What you’ve seen now is an agreement where depositors will be taken over, and you’ve got some type of guarantee there. That’s important for the market because, you don’t want to see this kind of thing unravel.”
*****
> First Republic reported last week that deposits tumbled more than 40% in the first quarter, triggering further declines in the already struggling stock. Shares have cratered 97% since the start of the year.
*****
> The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rose about half a percent in the premarket, as investors bet the crisis that ignited in March had been contained.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a winning week and month. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow added 272 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% as Big Tech earnings took center stage.
*****
> For the month, the Dow gained 2.5% to notch its best monthly stretch since January, while the benchmark index gained 1.5%. The tech-heavy index posted marginal gains. Earnings reports from major tech companies dominated much of last week’s market debate, fueling the narrative that earnings are faring better-than-feared, despite many widespread macroeconomic concerns.
*****
> So far, a little over half of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with more than 79% and about 72% surpassing earnings and sales expectations, respectively. First-quarter earnings are currently on track to fall 3.7% for the period, a smaller drop than the 6.7% decline projected on March 31, according to FactSet.
*****
> “There was definitely a very positive surprise on the big tech earnings,” said Jan Szilagyi, CEO of Toggle AI. “There was a certain trepidation going into the earnings season,” as expectations called for relative weakness.
*****
> Monday kicks off another busy week for earnings, with results from Norwegian Cruise Line and MGM Resorts. Reports from Pfizer, Starbucks, Advanced Micro Devices and CVS Health are due out later in the week.
*****
> Reports from many of these technology giants helped to lift some market confidence, he added.
*****
> In other news, investors anxiously await the latest rate hike decision from the Federal Reserve, due out Wednesday at the conclusion of the central bank’s policy meeting. As of Monday morning, about 89% of traders anticipate a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Wall Street will closely monitor remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, offering clues into the central bank’s forward policy path.
*****
> Wall Street also awaits ISM manufacturing data, construction spending and S&P Global manufacturing PMI on Monday. April’s nonfarm payrolls report is on deck Friday.

137,"China's Baidu beats quarterly revenue estimates, announces $5 bln share buyback",10,118wep3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/118wep3/chinas_baidu_beats_quarterly_revenue_estimates/,2,1677067321.0,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/1-chinas-baidu-beats-quarterly-091202379.html

China's Baidu Inc beat revenue estimates for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in its advertising, cloud and artificial intelligence businesses.

The search engine giant, which generates most of its revenue from online ads, is seeing advertisers return after China lifted its zero-COVID policies last year in a boost to the country's economic prospects.

The company also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $5 billion.

Quarterly revenue came in at 33.08 billion yuan ($4.80 billion), inching past analysts' estimates of 32.01 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue from Baidu Core, which includes search-based ad sales, cloud offerings and its autonomous driving initiatives, fell 1% to 25.7 billion yuan.

Baidu's research and development expenses were 21.4 billion yuan, accounting for 22.4% of revenue, as it plans to integrate its ChatGPT-like Ernie Bot into cloud, smart cars and household appliances, among other mainstream businesses.

The AI-driven chatbot, seen by many as China's most promising answer to the platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp, will complete internal testing in March.

""The Chinese AI market is on the verge of experiencing an explosive growth in demand, releasing unprecedented and exponential commercial value. Baidu stands as the best example of the long-term growth of China's AI market and is advancing at the forefront of this new wave,"" Baidu CEO Robin Li said.

Li added that the developers of Ernie Bot were sparing no effort to ensure the chatbot was made available as early as possible."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In news, overnight Nvidia released a dedicated GPU for ChatGPT, claiming to increase inference speed by 10x.

&#x200B;

Also in recent days, ChatGPT users around the world have been finding error warnings popping up on the site due to a large increase in access, and even privileged Plus accounts have not been spared.

&#x200B;

The latest research report of Anxin Securities has made an inference on GPT-4 arithmetic power demand: GPT-4 has increased its inferred arithmetic power demand to more than ten times due to the increase in complexity and the addition of image recognition function.

&#x200B;

NVIDIA Releases ChatGPT Dedicated GPU, Increases Inference Speed by 10 Times

&#x200B;

On March 21, Beijing time, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced the inference GPU (graphics processor) H100 NVL designed for ChatGPT at the 2023 GTC developer conference, which stitches together two of Nvidia's H100 GPUs to deploy large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, according to Punch News.

&#x200B;

The only current GPU that can actually handle ChatGPT is the NVIDIA HGX A100, and compared to the former A100, a standard server with four pairs of H100s and dual NVLINKs can now be 10 times faster, reducing the cost of processing large language models by an order of magnitude, said Jen-Hsun Huang.

&#x200B;

In addition to custom chips, NVIDIA also released cuLitho, a breakthrough lithography computational library. NVIDIA announced that after years of collaboration with TSMC, ASML, Synopsys and other companies, it has launched a new computational lithography application that greatly reduces the time and energy consumed by chip foundries in this process, ready for the arrival of 2nm and more advanced processes.

&#x200B;

In addition, NVIDIA has launched DGX Cloud, an AI supercomputing service, NVIDIA AI Foundations, a cloud service that accelerates enterprises to create big models and generative AI, and the world's first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system in partnership with Quantum Machines.

&#x200B;

Jen-Hsun Huang said that the AI industry is in an ""iPhone moment"" - startups are racing to build disruptive business models, and industry giants are looking for ways to respond, and are making bold statements - ""NVIDIA is about AI. -Nvidia is to be the TSMC of AI!

&#x200B;

On the domestic front, Jen-Hsun Huang said that in China, it has special customized Ampere and Hopper chips, these will be provided through Chinese cloud providers, such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, these companies to provide the ability to land, fully believe that they have the ability to provide top-notch system services, for Chinese startups will certainly have the opportunity to develop their own large language models.

&#x200B;

Google chatbots are also coming, AI big models lead the arithmetic layer for long-term benefits

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, March 21, US time, US tech giant Google Inc. launched a beta version of its AI chatbot Bard in a bid to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

&#x200B;

Bard, which will run separately from its Google search engine, currently generates answers in English only and currently offers access to users on a waitlist on a first-come, first-served basis. Google says over time, Bard will be adapted to more languages as well as rolled out to more regions.

&#x200B;

Axiom Securities pointed out that ChatGPT, GPT4.0, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Wenxin Yiyin and Google Bird were released one after another, and the AI big model represented by ChatGPT and its initial application ""stirred up a thousand layers of waves"".

&#x200B;

It said that with the release of multimodal large model GPT-4, the pace of applications based on text, pictures and other vertical scenarios is expected to accelerate from 1 to 10, similar to the blossoming of various types of APPs in the mobile Internet era, and the competition pattern will gradually intensify. And analogous to the late 19th century ""gold rush"" in the western United States, a large demand for shovels, jeans, it believes that the GPGPU as the representative of the arithmetic infrastructure as a large model of AI base will benefit long-term stability.

&#x200B;

GPT4 arithmetic power demand increased to more than ten times

&#x200B;

The latest research report of Anxin Securities made an inference on GPT-4 arithmetic demand and future trends: GPT-4's speculative arithmetic demand increased to more than ten times due to the increase of complexity and the addition of picture recognition function.

&#x200B;

It said that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pointed out in a public interview that GTP-4 has 20 times more parameters than GTP-3 and requires 10 times more computation than GTP-3; GTP-5 is released at the end of 2024 to 2025, which has 100 times more parameters than GTP-3 and requires 200-400 times more computation than GTP-3.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The bottleneck of arithmetic power is not in the absolute size of the arithmetic power, but in the cost of achieving that arithmetic power. From the perspective of cost, Guoxin Securities has also made a calculation on this, which according to the public data of GPT-4, the cost of asking a question per 1000 tokens is $0.03 and the cost of completing an answer per 1000 tokens is $0.06 under the context length of 8K; under the context length of 32K context length, the question cost per 1000 tokens is $0.06, and the answer completion cost per 1000 tokens is $0.12.

&#x200B;

It says that this arithmetic cost rises higher (50%-200% increase in input cost and 200%-500% increase in output cost) compared to the cost of GPT-3 (about $0.02 per 1000 tokens), and is even more significant compared to the cost of GPT-3.5-turbo, with a 14-29 times increase in input cost and a 29-59 times increase in output cost. The increase is 29-59 times.

&#x200B;

In addition, the expansion of the AI server market has simultaneously driven up the demand for high-speed NICs, HBM, DRAM, NAND, PCBs, etc. At the same time, the technology around the solution of GPU ""power wall, memory wall"" in the large computing power scenario continues to upgrade, such as storage and computing integration, silicon light / CPO industrialization process is expected to speed up; advanced process chip evolution in the existing Chiplet and other technical paths will also benefit; Risk-V due to open source and free, developer freedom, high degree of autonomy, high control, and the risk of the development of the chip. The advantages of Risk-V, such as free open source, high developer freedom, high degree of independent control, and more adaptable to AIoT processor architecture requirements, will drive the number of participating companies around AI scenarios."

**Market Price Action and General Outlook**:

In  recent  market activity, distribution has become more evident, with  investors  seeking safety in large technology stocks. However, this is  not  indicative of a healthy market. The MACD on the weekly chart  continues  to decline, suggesting that the SPY may drop while large tech  stocks  continue to rise. Recent market trends have been influenced by  key events such  as Fed speakers' assurances that it's too early to  consider rate cuts or  pauses, and the approaching X-date on the Federal  debt ceiling. The GDP  growth has been slowing, moving from 12.46% in  Q2 of 2021 to just 1.56%  in the last quarter, with more deceleration  expected, indicating an  emerging earnings recession. The market's  reliance on mega tech raises  questions about how long the market can  continue to deteriorate without  an apparent overall decline.

**Market Gex and Gamma Distribution**:

The  market has shown  remarkable stability despite a decline and a modest  increase in the  VIX, with short-dated equity vol retreating. Dealer  gamma remains close,  making it challenging for the market to move below  4000 or above 4200.  The market experienced a weaker sentiment, with  credit spreads and high  yield spreads rising. The Nasdaq reached YTD  highs, while small caps  experienced a momentary bullishness that  quickly reversed. The S&P  500's breadth models indicated a  disproportionate weakness, with only  28% of the index trading above  their respective 20-day moving averages.

**MSI Indicator**:

The  recent MSI and VIX signals show a  mixed market sentiment. In the last  few days, the MSI has been declining  from a high of 2.01 on 2023-05-05  to 0.69 on 2023-05-16, indicating a  shift from strong positive  sentiment to a more neutral sentiment. The  VIX has been oscillating in a  range of 15.78 to 20.09, which is  moderately high, suggesting a degree  of uncertainty and volatility in  the market. As the MSI approaches  zero, the market is becoming more  sensitive to sudden changes  influenced by the VIX. Traders should  exercise caution in this market  environment. Those with long positions  may consider adding hedges to  protect their investments, while others  should keep a close eye on the  MSI and VIX to identify potential market  trends and adjust their  strategies accordingly.

Given the current market sentiment, here are some potential scenarios for SPY on 5/18/2023:

1. **Bullish Scenario**:  If the market continues to show resilience as it has in recent days, we  could see a continuation of the upward trend. This could be further  supported if there's positive news from the meeting between McCarthy and  Biden regarding the debt ceiling agreement. In this case, SPY could  potentially move towards the flipping point at a strike of 417.1, as  indicated by the GEX analysis.
2. **Bearish Scenario**:  If the market reacts negatively to the declining MACD on the weekly  chart and the slowing GDP growth, we could see a downward movement in  SPY. This could be exacerbated if there's no agreement on the debt  ceiling, leading to a potential market sell-off.
3. **Neutral Scenario**:  Given the mixed market sentiment indicated by the MSI and VIX signals,  the market could also remain relatively stable, with SPY oscillating  around its current levels.

# [Stock futures rise Thursday after S&P 500 posts 4-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/22/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Thursday as traders weigh earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and assess future potential Federal Reserve moves.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%.
*****
> Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue.
*****
> The S&P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain.
*****
> The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes.
*****
> Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target and the labor market “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,” according to the minutes.
*****
> “The Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn’t get entrenched at its current high level,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “By mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.”
*****
> More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John’s, Wayfair and Bath & Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others.
*****
> In economic data, traders are looking forward to the latest GDP and weekly jobless claims data, which are both scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday.
*****
> Additionally, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at an event hosted by the Atlanta Fed Thursday morning. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will take part in a fireside chat in the afternoon.

146,🚀 $GOOGL: YOLOing on AI Beasts - BARD & OpenAI's Ancestor 🤯 DD Inside 📚,7,11td8p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11td8p7/googl_yoloing_on_ai_beasts_bard_openais_ancestor/,11,1679016634.0,"Yo, fellow degenerates 🦍! Gather 'round for some juicy DD on $GOOGL and how their AI wizardry with BARD, plus their 2017 research paper that gave birth to OpenAI's tech backbone, could send them flying to Alpha Centauri! 🚀🌌

🧠 The AI YOLO: Google's BARD is a mind-blowing AI model that could change the game in natural language understanding, opening doors to crazy gains and innovation across the board. 🚀

🎯 The Sauce: 1️⃣ BARD's Big Brain: Google's BARD is one smart mofo, with the potential to make waves in industries far and wide. 🔥 2️⃣ OpenAI's Daddy: Google's 2017 research paper is the OG that laid the foundation for OpenAI's tech stack, proving they're serious about AI domination. 🔍 3️⃣ Money Moves: Google's AI mastery, cash money, and global reach give 'em a sick edge over the competition. 🏆 4️⃣ AI Everywhere: Google's AI magic is all up in their products, making 'em even better and ready for more growth. 🌐

🌟 The Tendies: With mad AI skills, 200 IQ plays, and a killer track record, $GOOGL is set to ride the AI revolution to massive gains. 📈

⚠️ The Risks: 1️⃣ Heavyweight Showdown: $GOOGL's gotta throw down with other big dogs like $MSFT, $AAPL, and $AMZN. 🥊 2️⃣ The Law: AI's blowing up, and regulators might step in, throwing a wrench in the works. ⚖️ 3️⃣ AI Ups & Downs: Not all AI projects are born equal, and some might flop. 🧪

So, my fellow stonk lovers 💎🙌, $GOOGL's AI chops with BARD and their OpenAI OG status make 'em a force of nature. Keep those peepers on this ticker, and always do your homework before you YOLO. 🧐

Let's get those tendies! 🚀"
147,Which industry will benefit the most with cost savings due to AI advancements? Insurance?,6,12ua2t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ua2t5/which_industry_will_benefit_the_most_with_cost/,25,1682094879.0,"When we think about investing in AI, we usually tend to think about companies like Google that own DeepMind, or companies like Microsoft that have a stake in OpenAI. We think about Nvidia as a hardware player.

It's fine to invest in these companies, because if AI takes off huge, they'll all reap tremendous rewards, but what about the companies that will use these new AI tools to eliminate huge swaths of their payroll? I think we should concentrate on companies that can continue to do everything that their business model is aligned to do, just with 70 percent less human employees. The gigantic cost savings will start showing up in their surprising earnings beats, and the valuations for these companies will start to accelerate. 

So, which industry uses thousands of human workers to process forms and documents, that won't need any of these workers anymore once AI has completely automated their process? The first industry that popped into my mind is Insurance. Should we look for insurance companies with the largest number of current workers likely to be phased out?

Look, I know this is depressing, but what else are we going to do? If we're all going to have our jobs replaced, might as well get rich investing in these companies on the way out. I don't want to come across as a vulture that's just following a group of travelers in the Sahara desert, just waiting for them to drop dead so they can feast, but it is.... what it is."
148,roku thesis for friend,9,14ep6g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ep6g4/roku_thesis_for_friend/,10,1687299546.0,"Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.

In terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.

In the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is ""Hold"". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.

Considering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:

**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.

**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.

**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.

**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.

**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.

**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.

**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.

**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.

**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is ""Hold"", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.

However, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.

An addendum that incorporates some extra key points:

**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.

**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.

**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.

**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.

**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.

In summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.

149,Trading Themes for Q4,7,12dpuzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12dpuzx/trading_themes_for_q4/,12,1680799058.0,"# Bearish:

**Oil:** OPEC cuts + China reopening + summer demand. This is inflationary and will impact all inflation inputs with the greatest impact being on the more volatile food and energy. Oil going up means higher for longer will be even higher and even longer. If somehow we avoid a recession, the price is going up as prices are somewhat muted currently over fears of a slowdown. Bearish for the market, bullish for oil stocks and dividends. VOC, DVN, ET, BTU - stocks like these are probably the best places to hide in the most bearish of economic outcomes. Someday the US needs to refill, a floor has been established at their price point.

**Rates and QT:** Central banks all have been and are committed to new rake hikes. Higher for longer is the global theme. Remember when Powell said it was transitory and did nothing for six months? He was late to pivot hawkish. He will be late to pivot dovish. It’s pretty clear he’s going to kill inflation or get fired trying. “The effects of stopping too soon are greater than stopping too late.” Short profitless growth with puts as most should retrace at least some or all of their 2023 gains.

**Banks** are seeing record withdrawals, please learn to read and understand the charts correctly. Less money in banks means less loans, less projects, tighter lending criteria. Less liquidity, more realized losses. The biggest shorts in the markets are banks - they are dead in the water, with a limited time one year get out of jail free card from the fed. Hundreds of reputable banks would implode if that facility was removed, and the only way they survive is if the facility is extended or rates get cut drastically. Short the sector ETFs - not sure buying puts here would work out given the IV and elevated premiums.

**Commercial Real Estate** could be the next economic issue to have a material impact on stocks being in essentially the same situation as the banks. REITs are getting withdrawal requests and putting pressure on selling assets to fulfill them. Debt positions must be closed, and refinancing is not attractive. Compounding this is the pandemic likely had a permanent negative impact on the price/value of commercial/office space globally. The debt tied to these assets must be unwound and this means more realized losses. Blackrock, the same entity WSB complains about buying up residential housing, is now halting withdrawals and unwinding things by a de facto margin call from its customers. If you want to be short real estate, you have to look for commercial specific trades as residential real estate is not facing this debt burden or supply/demand problem.

**Unemployment** cracks are starting to form. The data from q1 showed firms drastically slowed hiring by virtue of less job openings- this is the other side of the labor market, the open positions. If the trend continues, this means salaries stop being bid up, more people struggle to find new jobs. Less employed, chasing less salaries, means less liquidity/savings/bank deposits/stock purchases. Puts on profitless growth (selling calls would have higher expected value). Powell is requesting a 1 percent rise in unemployment, be bearish until he gets it.

**Earnings** are an unknown but when reviewing leading indicators weaker earnings are widely expected. A slowing consumer, rising interest costs, means less earnings at the bottom line. The PE ratios of many companies are disconnected from “reality” and the SP is overvalued historically.

**Geopolitical** environment is terrible and getting worse in terms of conflict. US political and social climate is getting worse in terms of conflict.

**All of the above is recessionary** and aligns with historical precedence of the capitalist boom-bust economic cycle.

# Neutral:

**This is a controlled demolition** \- the fed, the us, the eu, the oil cartels, the Chinese do not want a financial crisis nor do they want hyper inflation. “They” will do anything to avoid a total “collapse” and have magic fiscal and monetary policies to extend the problems into the future or make the tax paying population slightly more poor.

**Stagflation** is a very real potential outcome for the economy and for stocks performance. If the financial engineering works, but the asset bubble(s) pop financial assets will go sideways - like Japan. Instead of paying in dollars, we pay in time.

# Bullish:

**The new fed facility** saved the banks. This is not the same money printer or QE, but the net effect lowered 2 year yields and supported tech stocks. There is more room on this facility.

**The new 40 year mortgage.** This simply makes getting debt financing easier. More liquidity, some level of easing is applied specifically to the housing market. This is inflationary however and will only bid up residential housing demand further.

**Financial engineering**. As the reserve currency, politicians and the fed can engineer their way out of almost any problem. New banking facility, changing rates, QE, 40 year mortgages, tax credits, student loan forgiveness, UBI, and anything else they can come up with that we haven’t yet imagined.

**AI** is going to going to be disruptive, but if there was any time to use the excuse of “priced in” it is on the AI trend. If you haven’t spent 30 minutes interfacing with chatgpt you are likely missing a technological leap the scale of the computer, the internet, the mobile phone. Even if you don’t want to invest in the trend, invest in your understanding of chatgpt for your own skillset if you want to win. Calls and shares at “the bottom” on a basket of the best names in AI: MSFT, NVDA, GOOG and some small/mid cap stocks.

**The USD** won’t be replaced anytime soon certainly not in this economic cycle - the US and our military would essentially need to “default on its obligations” before the globe would stop investing in USD in favor of something else. No other country or group of countries is remotely as stable, trustworthy, powerful as the US. However the strength of the contender may continue to grow - watch Ray Dalio video on YouTube which explains this.

**Everyone is bearish** and professional sentiment is low, but stocks only go up. This is the BTFD generation, and the most average humans I know still have money to throw at assets. Institutional investors are positioned bearish, and sitting on high proportions of cash waiting to be deployed. The party is not over just yet.

The AI arms race is about to get real.

Wedbush’s Daniel Ives’ comments ahead of the much-talked-about bot’s anticipated entrance into the Microsoft ecosystem.

“This OpenAI investment/strategic partnership which is likely in the $10 billion range is a game changer in our opinion for Nadella & Co. as the ChatGPT bot is one of the most innovative AI technologies in the world today,” the 5-star analyst said.  


GameChanger:  
ChatGPT will also probably be integrated into Microsoft’s cloud services along with Azure, offering more “competitive threats” to the likes of Amazon and Google.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 19th, 2023.

# **S&P 500 breaks six-day win streak on Friday, but still notches best week since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
*****
> Stocks slipped on Friday as Wall Street closed out a huge week in which investors received a pause on rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, plus encouraging inflation data.
*****
> The S&P 500 ticked down 0.37% to close at 4,409.59, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 108.94 points, or 0.32%, to close at 34,299.12. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.68% to finish the session at 13,689.57.
*****
> Here are the major market milestones on the week:
> * The S&P 500 is up 2.6% on the week, its best performance since March.
> * It’s the S&P 500′s fifth positive week in a row, the first such streak since November 2021.
> * The benchmark is now up more than 26% from its bear market low.
> * The Nasdaq Composite is up about 3.3% on the week, its best week since March.
> * The Nasdaq is up eight weeks in a row, its best winning streak since 2019.
> * Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up six days in a row through Thursday.
> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 1.3% for the week, its third positive week in a row.
> * The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit their highest levels since April 2022.
*****
> The Federal Reserve delivered what investors wanted this week when the central bank left rates unchanged Wednesday after 10 consecutive hikes. While the Fed signaled that two more rate increases were coming this year, many traders and economists on Wall Street believe the Fed could be nearly done. Earlier in the week, the May consumer price index came in at the lowest in two years.
*****
> Adobe added 0.9% after beating results and issuing upbeat guidance, the latest tech stock to rally. AI darling Nvidia gained 10% this week, adding to its 192% surge this year. Microsoft added 4.7% this week and hit a record Thursday. Tech shares were the hardest hit initially when the Fed embarked on its rate-hiking campaign.
*****
> “Wall Street remains upbeat that the AI wave won’t be going away anytime soon and that investors will prefer US stocks as we see diverging central bank policies worldwide,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “This stock market rally seems a bit overextended but too much money remains on the sidelines, which means if the AI trade remains intact, this winning streak for the S&P 500 can continue.”
*****
> Friday brought more good news on the inflation and economic front. Consumer inflation expectations fell in June, with one-year assumptions for price pressures declining to 3.3% from 4.2% in May. The headline reading from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers came in at 63.9, higher than estimates of 60.2 from Dow Jones.
*****
> Friday’s session saw choppy moves across the stock market as stock options, index futures and index future option contracts.
*****
> Friday also marks the final trading day before a long weekend, with the market closed Monday in observation of Juneteenth.

> # Four Things the Bulls Need to Know

> “The stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming.” -Old stock market axiom

> Here are four things that have caught my attention over the past week.

> First up, you might have heard by now, but the S&P 500 moved into a new bull market, up more than 20% from the October ’22 lows. We wrote about this in detail here, but investors need to know that a year after this happened, the S&P 500 was historically up 17.7% on average and higher 12 out of 13 times.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-3-800x381.png))**

> Adding to the fun, S&P 500 finally made a new 52-week high this week, the first one since early January 2022. What does this mean? Below we looked at all the times stocks went at least one year without a new 52-week high and the good news is more strength is quite likely. A year later stocks have been higher an incredible 15 out of 15 times and up more than 17% on average. Adding that to the numbers in the first table and the next year could continue to surprise to the upside.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-3-800x477.png))**

> Next up, this week marked officially eight months since the bear market ended. To think stocks would be up more than 20% by now would have been crazy to most investors if they were being honest. The quote I used above is one I always think about when stocks fall and it really does sum up investor sentiment well. Very few were saying ‘buy stocks’ last October and most didn’t say it early in 2023 either.

> We did note the week of the lows why the lows were likely in (and boy did the bears hate that call), but even I’ve got to admit the strength this year has been impressive. We moved to overweight equities in our Carson House View models in mid-December and we added to equity risk in late March during the regional bank crisis. To sum it up, we’ve been in the lonely bullish camp and continue to think higher prices are coming.

> What does eight months without a new 52-week low mean? It would be extremely rare for stocks to roll over and make new lows from here for starters. Also, three months later the S&P 500 was up 85% of the time, six months later 90% of the time, and a year later 80% of the time higher. The bottom line, once you get to eight months without a new 52-week low, the upward trajectory likely stays in place.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-1-800x277.png))**

> Lastly, the bear market officially started a year ago this week, as the S&P 500 moved to down 20% from the January ’22 peak on 6/13/2022. That wasn’t a fun time for investors at all, but here we are a year later, and stocks are up more than 16%. In other words, had you had the intestinal fortitude to buy when all the headlines were negative, you’d be sitting on some great gains a year later. Again, think about the quote at the top of this blog. This is what is important to always remember. Stocks go up and they go down. If you want to get some good deals, you need to buy when they are lower.

> # Why the Fed Wasn’t As Hawkish As Everyone Thinks

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) didn’t raise rates in June, leaving the Federal Funds rate in the 5-5.25% range. This was the first meeting in which they held back ever since they started raising rates back in March 2022.

> However, the big news was that Fed members project rates to be 0.5%-points higher than what they projected back in March. Members updated their projections for rates to hit 5.6% at the end of 2023, up from the previous estimate of 5.1%. By itself, this was viewed as a very hawkish signal, despite the pause in rate hikes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Fed-rate-projections-600x800.png))**

> If you recall, the last set of projections was made in March soon after the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. At the time, they said that potential credit tightening would be equivalent to rate hikes, so they left projections unchanged.

> Fast forward three months and the economy looks to have weathered the banking crisis, even as core inflation (excluding food and energy) remains elevated. Hence the update to where they believe rates should be at the end of 2023.

> However, the rest of the materials they released, along with Fed Chair Powell’s comments suggest more rate hikes are not a certainty.

> **The Fed is (finally) acknowledging the economy’s resilience**

> Along with interest rate projections, Fed members also updated their economic projections. This is where things got interesting. The updated projections included:

> * Raising 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%
>  * Dropping the 2023 unemployment rate from 4.5% to 4.1%

> Despite projecting more rate hikes, they seem to believe that economic growth will be stronger than they expected back in March, and the unemployment rate lower.

> At the same time, they also expect inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index (their preferred measure) to be 3.9% y the end of 2023. In March, the expectation was 3.6%. The higher projection makes sense within the context of the economic strength we’re seeing currently (we’ve written about this).

> Moreover, Fed members expect core inflation to slow to 2.6% in 2024, leading them to project interest rate cuts worth about 1%. Even as the economy grows 1.1% in 2024.

> Take all these projections with several grains of salt. Moreover, these projections are not forecasts – instead, they’re more like best guesses.

> However, it is a sign that Fed officials finally believe that inflation can slow down without a recession. That’s a significant turnaround from what they’ve been signaling over the last year, i.e. a huge economic slowdown/recession is necessary for inflation to fall.

> In fact, Powell acknowledged that the conditions are in place for inflation to slow down – economic growth has fallen below trend though activity remains strong, the labor market is less tight, and goods supply chain disruptions are easing.

> Pausing in June allows them to get more information about the impact of rate hikes and the banking crisis. Now, the July Fed meeting is only 6 weeks away and there’s not enough data that will give them that information. Instead, they’re looking for at least 3 months of data to see how things evolve.

> That buys time and indicates that 2 more rate hikes (each worth 0.25%) are not a sure thing. At the same time, raising the 2023 estimate ensures that investors believe they are serious about curbing inflation, and gives them the optionality to increase rates if inflation remains persistent.

> **Good news: inflation looks to be headed lower**

> Headline CPI inflation has decelerated from a peak of 9.1% year-over-year in June 2022 to 4% in May. Over the past three months, inflation is running at a 2.2% annualized pace, the slowest 3-month pace since two and half years.

> The big driver of the pullback has been energy, but more recently, food prices have also started falling. Vehicle prices, which boosted inflation last year, are also moving lower – used car prices rose over the last two months, but private data indicates that it’s going to reverse soon.

> What’s left? As the chart below indicates, a lot of it is shelter inflation (the dark green bar). This is the main reason why core inflation remains elevated, running at a 5% annualized pace over the last three months. That’s simply too high for the Fed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-HEadline-inflation-breakdown-662x800.png))**

> The good news is that shelter inflation looks to be at an inflection point. We’ve discussed in the past how the official rental inflation data has a significant lag to the private market data. Private data have been showing rents to be decelerating for more than a year now. It’s taken a while, but the official data is now turning around as well. It is a bit like turning an aircraft carrier around, and so it is going to take a while. But it is just a matter of time before core inflation decelerates on the back of falling shelter inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-rental-inflation-private-vs-official-598x800.png))**

> Now, the Fed has said that they need to see even services inflation excluding shelter decelerate. We received good news on that front. The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter. It measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently. Over the past 3 months, this measure is running at a 2.5% annualized pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Sticky-CPI-615x800.png))**

> On top of this, the producer price index, which measures input prices for businesses and typically leads inflation, has collapsed to just 1.2% year-over-year in May. That’s well off the peak pace of 11.6% we saw in March 2022, and lower than the pre-pandemic average of 2%. Even excluding food and energy, PPI is down to 2.8% now from 9.7% 14 months ago.

> All in all, there’s encouraging news on the inflation front even as the economy remains resilient. Powell’s comments reflect that. This is why we’re not quite so convinced that two more rate hikes are baked in. But expect them to leave rates higher for longer.

> # Why Strong Stock Returns on Friday is Bullish

> One of the most hated and despised rallies continued last week, with the S&P now up nearly 12% on the year and officially up more than 20% from the October lows. If you’ve been reading or listening to what the Carson Investment Research team has been saying, then you know we’ve been in the camp we’ve been in a new bull market for quite some time now, expecting continued higher prices. None the less, with stocks now officially up 20%, we see others finally coming around. For instance, check out the cover of Barron’s over the weekend. Yeah, we sure weren’t seeing things like that in January, were we?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Slide1-1-800x450.png))**

> Sonu and I both wrote blogs last week on stocks being up 20% from the lows and you can read them here and here. Additionally, here’s a Yahoo! Finance hit I did on October 13, the exact day that stocks officially bottomed. I noted many reasons to think better times were coming and fortunately, that is exactly what has happened.

> Additionally, here’s the blog I wrote a week after the October lows titled Why Stocks Likely Just Bottomed. Our bullish tilt since late last year wasn’t popular and has been widely mocked by many bears for months and months. We aren’t hearing so much chirping from them now though

> One thing we’ve notice lately is buying and strength in stocks later in the week, specifically on Thursday and Friday. We love to see this, as it shows there is confidence to hold stocks over the weekend. Those of us that have done this long enough remember how volatile (and usually bearish) Friday afternoons would be during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) or during the COVID bear market in February and March of 2020. Even last year during the bear market we saw historically weak returns on Friday.

> So, to now see buying and confidence on Thursday and Friday in ’23 are significant changes from what we saw during previous bearish phases and could be another clue that this bull market is indeed healthy and likely has legs left.

> This first chart shows just how much better Thursday and Friday are doing than the other days this year. Again, we like to see this late week buying as a clue things are healthy and confident. (For those wondering how we did the annualized return calculations, the average Friday return this year so far has been a gain of 0.40%, so we multiplied that by 252 (the number of trading days per year) to get an annualized return).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pic3-800x450.png))**

> Let’s talk specifically about Friday, shall we? As of last week, Friday was up an incredible 101.7% on an annualized basis in ’23. This would come in as the best Friday EVER. Now, let’s be honest, the odds do favor this coming back to earth some over the remaining rest of the year, but overall we are on a great start to this year being one of the best ever for stocks on a Friday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pic2_Edited-800x450.png))**

> What does it all mean you ask? In the final table below, I looked at all years that had at least a 55% annualized return on Friday. This was the very best 12 years ever for Friday returns and sure enough, they are also some of the best years overall for stocks. In other words, some of the best years ever also saw strong performance on the last day of the week, further confirming that buying on a Friday is what you tend to see in bullish markets.

> We will end on this note, stocks were higher 12 out of 12 times in these years and up a very impressive 24.8% on average, about half of this year’s 12.0% return so far. This could be a subtle clue that as good as this year has been, it could have more in the tank before all is said and done. I did discuss this Friday concept on Yahoo! Finance on Friday.

> # Solid Pre-Election June Gains As Expected

> June is delivering much better than typical pre-election year strength, but NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are leading the charge as usual. R2K was up 7% for the month yesterday and NAS was up 4%, both up more today. However, June quarterly OpEx is riddled with volatility. Week after DJIA is Down 27 of the last 33 years 1990-2022. (2023 STA page 108.) S&P down 23 of 33. NASDAQ down 18/33.

> So far in 2023 NASDAQ is closely tracking the pre-election pattern up 28.6% year-to-date! But remember, June ends NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months with a seasonal peak in mid-July. Enjoy this AI/Chip-driven rally for now and use it to reposition for the Worst 4 Months July-October.

> The backdrop is set up for sideways action over the weak summer months, especially after mid-July into the worst two months of the year August and September. This is lining up well for our NASDAQ Best 8 Months MACD Seasonal Sell Signal that can occur anytime on or after June 1. AI (Almanac Investor) subscribers will be emailed when it triggers.

> # More Balanced June

> Heading into the month of June, stock market performance this year was a clear case of the haves and the have-nots. The chart below shows the performance of S&P 500 sectors on a YTD basis through the end of May. As of 5/31, just three sectors - Technology, Communications Services, and Consumer Discretionary - were outperforming the S&P 500 YTD, and the eight other sectors were not only underperforming the S&P 500's YTD gain of 8.9%, but they were also all down on a YTD basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/06/061323-Sectors-YTD.png))**

> The flip of the calendar has seen the trend of uneven YTD returns flip as well. Besides the fact that every sector is up on a MTD basis, the number of sectors outperforming the S&P 500's 4.6% MTD gains are much more evenly split with five sectors outperforming and six underperforming. Surprisingly, one of those sectors lagging behind the S&P 500 is Technology! Uneven market returns have been a key complaint of bears all year. If the pattern of June continues, though, what will they blame next?

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street awaits tech earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/23/stock-futures-inch-down-as-wall-street-awaits-tech-earnings.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell on Monday as investors awaited a slew of corporate earnings from big tech companies, as well as fresh economic data releases.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 89 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major indexes all fell last week as the earnings season began to ramp up, with several prominent banking names posting their quarterly results for the first time since the bank failures in March. The Dow dropped 0.23% and ended a four-week winning streak. The Nasdaq declined 0.42%, while the S&P edged down 0.1%.
*****
> Roughly 76% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Friday beat analyst earnings estimates, according to FactSet data. However, first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are estimated to decline an overall 5.2%, per Refinitiv.
*****
> Wall Street is looking ahead toward mega-cap tech earnings results this week in what will mark the halfway point of earnings season. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are among the high-interest names scheduled to announce their results for the first quarter.
*****
> “A lot of these companies took 2022 as an opportunity to dump all the bad stuff into their earnings,” said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Friday, regarding upcoming tech earnings.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a lot of positive surprises coming out of their earnings reports,” Damodaran added.
*****
> Investors are also keeping a close eye out on new economic data that will provide insight into whether inflation is cooling, or if the Federal Reserve will announce another rate hike at its next meeting in early May. GDP numbers for the first quarter, as well as April’s consumer sentiment data will be released among a flurry of other economic indicators.
*****
> “Part of the reason why we’re so focused on the economic data is we think the investor narrative is still around the Fed and interest rates. And we think the economic reports over the next seven to 10 days are going to be the really big driver of ultimately what the Fed is going to do,” said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments.
*****
> Bassuk continued, “We’re expecting the data, frankly, to be mixed. And we think that’s going to continue to cause uncertainty and continued volatility. I think, to some extent, the Fed rate hike slowed down the economy. But there’s still elements where things are still looking pretty robust. Because of that, we’re thinking that the Fed is likely to do one more rate cut.”
*****
> Coca-Cola and Credit Suisse are set to report earnings Monday before the bell. Whirlpool and First Republic Bank will be announcing their results after Monday’s trading session. Traders will also watch out for the Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing survey results to gauge the state of the state’s factory activity.

# [Stock futures rise after GOP and White House reach tentative U.S. debt ceiling deal: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday after the Biden administration and Republican lawmakers reached a tentative deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures gained 0.6%. Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 1.2%.
*****
> President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default over the weekend, with Congress set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday. Lawmakers have not signaled that they intended to return to Capitol Hill early to work on the deal. Both Republican and Democratic support is needed for the bill agreement to pass.
*****
> “Although the upcoming votes in Congress still pose a small risk, the main risk had been that political pressures would prevent a deal from coming together,” wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a note. “Now that a deal has been reached, it seems very likely to pass both chambers of Congress in the coming week.”
*****
> The agreement comes just days before the so-called “X date” on June 5, which is the earliest date the Treasury Department has signaled the U.S. could default on debt obligations. The initial compromise was first announced on Saturday evening.
*****
> The long negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders raised concern among investors that a default on U.S. debt could take place. Wall Street has already contended with persistent inflation and a banking crisis this year.
*****
> Stocks closed higher on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 finished last week with gains. The market was closed Monday due to Memorial Day.
*****
> Investors will also turn their attention to May jobs data out on Friday, while the April Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be released on Wednesday. Corporate earnings from HP Inc and Salesforce are due on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

There is a public company called Genius Sports (GENI) who owns the video version of Chat GPT through their Second Spectrum acquisition. They currently create new and actionable data from live sports broadcasting. The data has use in their sports betting business as well as enabling teams to use the data to create insight for better team performance. Their technology can be used across all video to create actionable insight beyond just sports. They are the Chat GPT of video! Stock currently has $1B valuation that is based solely on the growth of data they provide to sports betting companies to run their business. OpenAI is expected to do $200M in total revenue for 2023, Second Spectrum will do $25M in revenue. Why isn't Second Spectrum worth $3.6B based on Chat GPT's recent valuation for the video version of Chat GPT? Would add about $16 per share to the current $4.80 share price of $GENI.

#[Stock futures rise Friday as regional banks try to rebound: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were higher Friday as regional banks rebounded and traders tried to end a volatile week on a high note.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 147 points, or 0.44%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.46% and 0.3%, respectively.
*****
> Regional banks rose broadly after declining in the previous session. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1%, with shares of embattled bank PacWest rising 0.9%. Western Alliance advanced 2.2%. On Thursday, regional banks dropped broadly after PacWest said its deposits fell sharply last week.
*****
> Tesla shares rose 1.6% after Elon Musk said Thursday that he’s stepping down as chief executive at Twitter. He will oversee product at the social media firm.
*****
> Investors are also keeping an eye on Washington as concern around debt ceiling negotiations persisted. CNBC reported that a debt ceiling meeting between President Joe Biden and congressional leaders that was set for Friday was postponed to next week.
*****
> Investors are coming off a fourth straight losing session for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Thursday slid more than 200 points, or 0.66%. Disney’s decline a day after it reported poor subscriber numbers weighed on stocks. The S&P 500 declined 0.17%. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.18%.
*****
> Meanwhile, weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data, a sign of easing inflation, failed to shield investors from ongoing concerns of a downturn ahead — particularly as a handful of stocks continue to carry the market.
*****
> “It’s a fairly typical story,” JPMorgan’s Jason Hunter said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You see the thin leadership, and then at some point the growth decelerates enough to cause a true flight to cash.”
*****
> Investors are anticipating preliminary consumer sentiment data on Friday, set to release after the open. Economists polled by the Dow Jones are expecting a May reading of 63.0, which would be lower than the level of 63.5 in the previous reading.
*****
> April import prices are also due out before the open on Friday. Economists are expecting a 0.3% rise last month, compared to the decline of 0.6% the prior month.
*****
> As of Thursday’s close, the Dow and the S&P 500 are headed for their second negative week in a row, down 1.08% and 0.14% this week, respectively. However, the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for its third straight positive week, up 0.76%.

158,"IBM: Not Your Grandma's Boyfriend’s Favorite Tech Giant Anymore, Pioneering the AI Revolution Like a Boss",4,13rkmfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13rkmfv/ibm_not_your_grandmas_boyfriends_favorite_tech/,26,1685028179.0,"**Picture  IBM. Yeah, I'm talking about that old-as-dirt tech behemoth your  grandma's boyfriend probably worships. The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**

**If  you haven’t been paying attention, IBM’s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with “disrupters” like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM’s MAIN FOCUS!**

**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy’s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend’s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**

**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin’s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**

**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**

**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**

**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend’s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**"
159,"Effects of name rebranding on stock value: MCG (Membership Collective Group) changes to SHCO (Soho House & Co). Can you buy ""cool""? [DD]",5,11xk8g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11xk8g6/effects_of_name_rebranding_on_stock_value_mcg/,5,1679412575.0,"What are your thoughts on the ""rebranding"" name change from Membership Collective Group Inc. (ticker MCG) to Soho House & Co Inc. (SHCO)? Will this change create value or is the change superficial?

Some open questions:

**Will business operations or resource distributions change in a meaningful way?**

MCG first pitched itself as a tech company during their recent IPO in July 2021: ( MCG is “a global membership platform of physical and digital spaces”) and a SoHo House app, but they claim that the name change will be accompanied by a ""return to their roots"" as a members club with a ""member-first focus"".

[https://www.ft.com/content/cbc925e1-0915-404b-b5ef-ca8bb62793df](https://www.ft.com/content/cbc925e1-0915-404b-b5ef-ca8bb62793df)

\-What will happen to their Soho House app?-Will they invest more in the co-working spaces or the members clubs going forward?-How will members react to recent hikes in membership fees (almost doubled to about  £2,750.00 per year for members over 27 years old to access all houses)

[https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/pricing](https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/pricing)

**When does ""brand"" matter to investors in addition to profitability?**

Applicants join SoHo house for it's cool brand name. The claim of being a ""networking space for creatives"" seems overstated. 

But how much do investors care about putting money into stocks that ""sound cool""? Halal investing appeals to investors moral compass, but does ""cool"" investing appeal to institutional or retail investors identity?

The business model started with a strategy to buy failing hotels, and turn them into members clubs. Recently they have adapted their model to increase the types of subscriptions (and the price of subscriptions.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/dealbook/soho-house-ipo.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/dealbook/soho-house-ipo.html)

**Historical effects of name changes on stock price?**

A study of 58 firms across 1981-1985 showed name change did lead to increase in stock price, especially when initial performance was poor (like MCG) and when the firms produced industrial goods (unlike MCG).

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/183841](https://www.jstor.org/stable/183841)

A more recent study during the 2000s internet surge showed that adding ""dot com"" or other internet affiliation to existing companies produced returns of around 74 percent for the 10 days after the announcement. This is similar to why many companies are trying to add AI to their brand and mission in 2023.

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-1082.00408?casa\_token=s-3IkpI38O8AAAAA:mOh62hGRG35lMtaeJQICmHUCsb0aHUw\_0tvdIj-QULr6zLjMMU9MP0K1UnZrAnYDh59p7cEFJvF7i\_MeTA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-1082.00408?casa_token=s-3IkpI38O8AAAAA:mOh62hGRG35lMtaeJQICmHUCsb0aHUw_0tvdIj-QULr6zLjMMU9MP0K1UnZrAnYDh59p7cEFJvF7i_MeTA)

&#x200B;

**Will they be profitable in the long run?**

The 2021 MCG IPO price was $14, and has steadily declined to the current price around $6.50.

The lingering question is can a company who relies on exclusivity (making it hard to gain membership) scale after going public? Do private membership clubs appeal to a large enough segment of people with disposable income?

Raising membership prices during a recession is a risky choice, but it seems to be paying of in the short term.

Some Q4 Financial Report highlights:

* Fiscal Year 2022 Total revenues increased 73.4% year-over-year to $972.2 million.
* Total Members grew to 226,830 from 211,351 in Q3 2022 and 45.6% year-over-year
* MCG Membership waitlist now sits at an all-time high of \~86,000 and retention rates continue around pre-pandemic levels

160,AI Investment Play Due to API/Plugin Integration of GPT,4,12464pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12464pz/ai_investment_play_due_to_apiplugin_integration/,8,1679962363.0,"So basically, last week's big news was the announcement on availability of plugins/APIs for ChatGPT.

[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins)

This will allow users to use the GPT prompts to interface with other third-party apps (e.g. Expedia, Shop, Slack) and facilitate transactions.  I think this is a big step towards changing the way we interface with other websites when it comes to shopping, ordering food, communicating with others, etc.  That being said, most likely, not all of these apps will benefit from the interface as at the end of the day, the user traffic needs to increase significantly due to the technology.  In other words, I am not sure if more people will be using Expedia now that they can connect through GPT given that Expedia hinges on the number of people willing to go on a vacation/trips.  And facilitating this move will not make it such that more people will go on vacations/trips than ever before.  So I think.

So in picking AI related stocks, I think one needs to take this information into account and be creative about what kind of companies will get a significant increase in traffic/users due to the connection with GPT.  In general, it seems like there needs to be some sort of barrier that dissuades many customers from currently using the app and GPT breaking down this barrier.  So I am thinking something to do with creative work (e.g. game development, art creation, music creation) can be a solid play here.  For example, if ChatGPT and its integration makes it easier for anyone to create pretty good looking and entertaining games, it is conceivable that the number of users for a platform like Unity might increase dramatically.

Any thoughts on this matter?  Any comment on whether this line of reasoning seems reasonable and if it does, specific stocks that can benefit from explosion of users can be beneficial in discussion."

*****
> Stock market futures were slightly higher Thursday as investors tried to regain their footing a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-day winning streak and a recent market rally appeared to fade.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow were 39 points higher, or 0.11%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.16% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow fell roughly 172 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 declined 0.7% for its first negative session in four. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.25%. The tech-heavy index and S&P 500 are now both on track to snap a four-week winning streak.
*****
> Those moves came as traders parsed through the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting. The central bank remains committed to fighting inflation, but indicated it could adjust its pace of tightening based on market conditions.
*****
> Investors have been hoping that the Fed might slow the pace of its rate hikes after July’s consumer price index reading showed inflation cooling slightly. But not everyone is convinced.
*****
> “We’re in the camp that the Fed is not going to pivot,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The minutes didn’t make us change our mind at all. We think a 75 basis point hike is likely in September, and we’ll see more hikes at the end of the year ... we think the market is a little lofty right here,” he added.
*****
> The latest batch of earnings report didn’t help traders’ sentiment during Wednesday’s session. Target’s quarter missed estimates, with results from Lowe’s coming in mixed.
*****
> Some key economic data will also be released Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and existing home sales.

162,Open Source Automated Sentiment Analysis using Python Polygon.io and Open.ai,3,13o7r8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13o7r8x/open_source_automated_sentiment_analysis_using/,16,1684706531.0,"Greetings r/stocks I hope this post finds you well!

This tool is still in development and requires tuning! At this point I think Chat-gpt 4.0 code interpreter has taken me as far as we can get without expanding the effort with additional minds.

https://github.com/NerdyBurner/SAStocks

This tool is meant to replicate this research from the university of Florida:

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4412788](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4412788)

Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models

Article explaining the research:

[https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chatgpt-trading-algorithm-delivers-500-returns-in-stock-market](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chatgpt-trading-algorithm-delivers-500-returns-in-stock-market)

ChatGPT Trading Algorithm Delivers 500% Returns in Stock Market

# 

Problem I had to solve:

The university used backend financial data, we as individuals do not have access to that data. Enter polygon.io and their incredible toolkit of financial data!

# 

Why did I build this tool?

I have had extensive conversations with chat-gpt4. One thing is clear, the best use of its abilities is to rapidly democratize its computational ability. Yes the tool likely requires refinement but now its in your hands. If you know python you can reach out to me to discuss refinements. If you are in finance and can help with the algorithms and analysis please also contribute if desired.

Just imagine a million people using AI intelligence to successfully inform their investing. The researchers achieved 500% returns.. if we are even half as successful it will be a huge win for all involved

# 

Targeting with Tickers.csv

I deliberately made this flexible. I'm targeting the S&P 500 but you could target whatever you want in the stock market by editing this list...

# 

How will I use the data?

The database generated by this output will be fed into GPT 4 Code Interpreter. Expect a second post that links back to this one with the data analytics. Right now the model is running - one thing I will say is due to rate limits it takes a while..

# Putting my money where my mouth is:

We determined that the model will benefit from the performance of actual holdings so I am giving $3000 of my ROTH IRA to this process. Positions will be posted tomorrow by close of business.

**Application Functional Summary**

This application is a sentiment analysis tool for stock market news. It uses both the Vader sentiment analysis tool from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the OpenAI API to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to specific stock tickers.

The application pulls API keys from a CSV file named api\_keys.csv where each key is stored as a row. The keys that it uses are for OpenAI and Polygon.io. Stock tickers are obtained from a CSV file named Tickers.csv.

The application saves news articles and sentiment analysis results to SQLite databases, and it also prints a final report with the aggregated sentiment scores for all stock tickers.

**Required or Suggested Programs**

Python 3.6 or higher is required to run this application.

You'll also need several Python libraries, including pandas, nltk, requests, sqlite3, openai, and retrying.

**API keys for the following services:**

OpenAI: You can get an API key by creating an account on the OpenAI website ([https://www.openai.com/](https://www.openai.com/)). The cost is $20 per month plus additional charges based on usage.

Polygon.io: You can get an API key by creating an account on the Polygon.io website ([https://polygon.io/](https://polygon.io/)). The cost is $30 per month.

**Areas for Improvement**

Aggregated Scores Algorithm:

The current algorithm for calculating the aggregated score is quite simple, and it might not accurately reflect the actual sentiment of the news articles. This could be improved by using a more sophisticated sentiment scoring algorithm, perhaps one that takes into account more nuanced aspects of the news articles.

GPT Prompt:

The prompt used for GPT-3 could potentially be improved. Currently, it asks the model to categorize the sentiment of an article as 'Good', 'Bad', or 'Unknown'. This could be expanded to include more nuanced sentiments, or to ask for a more detailed analysis of the article.

Expanding the Inputs to the Sentiment Analysis:

Currently, the application only considers the title and description of each news article for sentiment analysis. This could be expanded to include other elements of the articles, such as the main body text, or even comments on the article if available.

Expand to More Data Sources:

Currently, the application only uses news articles from Polygon.io. It might be beneficial to include more data sources to get a more comprehensive view of the sentiment around each stock ticker.

Error Handling and Logging:

While the application does some error handling, it could be improved by adding more detailed logging, so that if something goes wrong, it's easier to diagnose the problem.

Code Optimization:

Some parts of the code could potentially be optimized for better performance, especially the parts that involve making requests to external APIs or querying the database.

Remember to always keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly."

This model is expected to be much better than its predecessor, GPT-3. The launch date for GPT-4 has not been suspected to start next week, and people are excited about the new capabilities that it might have.

GPT-4 is expected to be better at understanding and processing natural language, which means it might be able to answer more complex questions and generate more accurate responses. It could also have the ability to create videos from text, which would be a big step forward in the field of AI.

Microsoft is reportedly working with OpenAI to develop GPT-4, and this partnership could benefit both companies. For example, Microsoft might be able to use GPT-4 to improve its chatbots and virtual assistants, which could make them more helpful and engaging for users. Microsoft might also be able to use GPT-4 to automate the video production process, which could save time and effort.

Overall, GPT-4 could be a big step forward for the field of AI, and Microsoft's collaboration with OpenAI could help it stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field."
165,A Quantum Leap In AI: IonQ Aims To Create Quantum Machine Learning Models At The Level Of General Human Intelligence,1,13z5ltm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13z5ltm/a_quantum_leap_in_ai_ionq_aims_to_create_quantum/,31,1685779877.0,"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.

In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.

Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).

*****
> Stock futures were flat Monday, with investors preparing for more quarterly earnings reports.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 gained about 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up 58 points, or 0.17%.
*****
> Charles Schwab is set to report earnings later in the day. The stock has been under pressure recently, as traders feared the brokerage may suffer a similar fate to regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. However, the company has defended its financial position, noting last month it has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Schwab shares are down 39% year to date.
*****
> Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are slated to report earnings Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Investors have been eyeing the overall health of the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month spurred a liquidity crisis. Other notable names outside of financials, including electric vehicle heavyweight Tesla will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, while Procter & Gamble reports on Friday.
*****
> Corporate earnings got off to a positive start last week as banking giants Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat expectations. But discouraging retail sales data showed a slowdown in consumer spending by 1% in March pulled markets lower Friday.
*****
> As companies grapple with sticky inflation and higher rates, many investors have braced for a downbeat earnings reports, but data from Bank of America suggests that this earnings reporting season may already be faring better than expected. Of the companies that reported during the first week, 90% topped EPS estimates. That marks the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the Wall Street firm said.
*****
> For the week, however, stocks remained resilient. The Dow was positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both had their fourth week in the green in five.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, April 17th, 2023! :)**"
167,Feb 6th 2023 Bullish Moves,3,10ux5mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10ux5mp/feb_6th_2023_bullish_moves/,29,1675656486.0,"Here are my thoughts:

**Bread and Butter Stocks:**

1. **NVDA -**   No questions asked here right. Haha just kidding. This company is by   far one of the best buys that one could possibly pull off for a good   long term investment ranging anywhere from 1-3 years or if you have more   time try 5-10 years. This chip manufacturer not only produces the best   chips but they produce the most chips found in traditional technology   (CPU's, GPU's, Phones, Tablets, \*Vehicles). What makes these chips   special is their functionality in which how they can have AI like   tendencies found within the code of their chip. These tendencies so to   say are a back bone to the future move of what AI has to update to to   help overall human society as living conditions will only get harsher as   the years come inevitably. \*Note: Maybe not so much vehicles as this   next company has their leavings all over this are of the industry.
2. **TSLA -**   Saw this one coming huh. Without a doubt I have heard the word 'Tesla'   at least every week since it tanked down in prices. They have a unique   like property compared to any other vehicle manufacturer on the  market.  That is the fact that they have all of their vehicles equipped  with the  best chip and code for the most efficient and optimal way of  Autonomous  driving. Now if one wants to play a game of connect the dots  one will  realize that both of these companies can be categorized as  companies  that possess AI like features. This is where things get fun  and where I  plan on calling some long shots for the future ahead and  due to recent  sensations on the internet.

The following section is based off the recent sensation of the AI program known as ChatGPT. This then lead me to a deep dive into the world of companies on the frontiers of AI development.

**Bullish Stocks:**

1. **BBAI -**   Big Bear.ai Holdings Inc is a company responsible for collecting data   information, compiling it to something meaningful, and relaying it back   to other bigger companies to target consumers more accurately. I heard   about this company by doing a search on who made ChatGPT and that  turned  out to be Open AI. They are not public on the stock market they  are a  private company.  The next thing associated to Open AI was Big  Bear and  man do their 5D 1M and 6M returns look promising.
2. **AI (C3.AI)** **-**   Came across this company after figuring out who else were some major   role players in the AI industry sector. Turns out C3.AI is a company who is all about the advancement of machine learning and AI which is very huge for human population future problems. One would be a fool not to invest in this now official categorized Bull stock.

**3. PLTR -**   Palantir Technologies is a company that focuses on the AI development of space craft like vehicles. They also have some projects within the government and cybersecurity sector. This one is another no brainer."

# [S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures jump after Nvidia’s blockbuster quarter: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 jumped Thursday as investors cheered the latest quarterly results from Nvidia. Meanwhile, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid after Fitch Ratings placed the United States’ AAA rating on a negative rating watch.
*****
> S&P 500 futures were up 0.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures popped 1.9%. Dow futures were down 85 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Nvidia shares surged 27% in the premarket trading after the artificial intelligence beneficiary gave stronger-than-expected revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter, while also reporting beats on the top and bottom line in the previous quarter. Several analysts covering the stock hiked their price targets on the stock following the results.
*****
> Other semiconductor stocks followed Nvidia higher, including AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor, which rose 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 6.2%.
*****
> Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings put the U.S.′ AAA long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on a negative watch. The rating agency said the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations have raised the risks that the government could miss payments on some of its obligations. However, Fitch said it still expects a resolution before the X-date.
*****
> Those moves follow a down day for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday posting a fourth straight day of losses. The 30-stock index dropped 255.59 points, or 0.77%. The S&P 500 ended the day lower by 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.61%.
*****
> Debt ceiling negotiations continued to weigh on the major averages. The talks hit a hurdle earlier Wednesday. Later, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy indicated negotiations were making progress.
*****
> “We play this political game leading up and into the limit,” Atlas Merchant Capital CEO Bob Diamond said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think there’s no question that it would be a terrible, terrible, terrible decision to default for the dollar, for U.S. Treasurys, for our brand and reputation. I think the chances of that happening are extremely light.”
*****
> In corporate earnings, retailers Best Buy, Dollar Tree and Ralph Lauren will report Thursday before the open.
*****
> Traders can expect the second reading on gross domestic product in the first quarter before the open on Thursday, as well as the latest weekly jobless claims data. April pending home sales data is also on deck after the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.8%, up from the decline of 5.2% the prior month.

169,The soap opera of BBBY and what might have been,0,wt0wue,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt0wue/the_soap_opera_of_bbby_and_what_might_have_been/,11,1660979568.0,"Ok so this week we've seen an almost bankrupt towel shop peak at a 6x run, 3000% gains on OTM calls, halts up and down, MSM fake news that turned out to be true, TV hosts trolling WSB live on air, and much more.

Legends have been made in the form of 27k loan guy, watermelon guy, $2M YOLO guy, and even the unsung heroes who dutifully went in at open yesterday when everyone thought it would bleed to $5, like the miners trudging in to clean up Chernobyl while it was still in a meltdown.

But my question is this: How high would BBBY have gone without RC's filings and sales?

As I see it, there are different levels of awareness of squeezes.

1 - Squeezes that are like trees in the forest that nobody sees fall.

2 - Squeezes that gain traction on Reddit and Stocktwits

3 - Squeezes that make it on to financial TV or financial publications 

4 - Squeezes that go fully mainstream

In the last category I can only really think of GME, AMC, and Elon Musk-pumped shitcoins.

BBBY was going smoothly through the gears and reached cat.4 with the AI created ginger hedge fund guy YOLOing 25m of god knows whose money and making a massive profit. But by the time that happened, the damage had already been done.

Considering the mainstream awareness, that insane gamma ramp, the shorts refusing to back down, RC as the figurehead inspiring irrationally positive sentiment, the risk-on market mood, I'd say had RC not sold, BBBY would've gone to $40 EoW, and probably peaked at $100 in the next few weeks. 


TLDR: THAT WAS AN INTERESTING WEEK. LOTS OF SQUEEZES WANT TO BE THE NEXT GME, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE. THIS ONE FELT LIKE IT MIGHT BE THOUGH. HOW HIGH WOULD BBBY HAVE GONE HAD COHEN NOT SOLD?"
170,Tesla stock ($TSLA) sinks as Barclays says it's time 'to move to the sidelines'.,1,14fvfiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14fvfiv/tesla_stock_tsla_sinks_as_barclays_says_its_time/,10,1687414916.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) stock sank 5.5% on Wednesday, its steepest loss in two months, after one analyst on Wall Street cautioned it was time to take some money off the table.  
  
In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near-term questions about the stock’s fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn’t exactly trade on fundamentals — it currently trades at a forward P/E of 80 — Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.  
  
“We believe the stock’s recent rally can be best explained by the market’s current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,” Levy said in his note. “Yet while we aren’t surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.”

Levy’s main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla’s recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and, most importantly, how multiple expansion is really the “entirety of the rally.”  
  
As for AI, the recent run-up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company’s ventures like FSD (full self-driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a “long-dated” opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.

Similarly, Tesla’s charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating “marketing benefits” for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long term, Levy says.  
  
The biggest factor for the \~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla’s near-term fundamentals haven’t changed, and while other AI-related stocks have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn’t the case for Tesla.  
  
Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla’s 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla’s margins are still “uncertain” given recent price cuts, though it is possible margins may have troughed. Finally, more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.  
  
All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla’s prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. “We continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,” Levy says, but “near term fundamentals need to be considered.”"

In contrast **ChatGPT, barely in it's early infancy, is already the fastest growing internet application in the history of humanity** ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/))

🔥 Desperation & Controversy 🔥

Just a few hours ago, The Verge published an article ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies)) detailing some damning allegations. The Information reported that a former Google AI researcher accused the company of using ChatGPT data (a rival's responses) to train Bard. Google denies it, but when asked directly, Bard fessed up ([https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20](https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20)).

The plot thickens. Jacob Devlin, a Google AI engineer, warned the company not to use ChatGPT data because it would violate OpenAI's terms of service and make Bard's answers look suspiciously similar. Google supposedly stopped using the data after his warnings, but who can trust them at this point?

Devlin then jumped ship, leaving Google to join OpenAI immediately. That's right, folks – we're seeing top talent abandon Google in droves, and it's only the beginning.

&#x200B;

👀 Why is this big? 🤔

**It's illegal for Google to use ChatGPT's data to train their AI**. There might be a lawsuit coming their way soon. If **OpenAI can get an injunction on Google Bard or any other of their AI technologies** based on this engineer's testimony, it's be game over for Google.

Careful though, I wouldn't bet on OpenAI either. Any company that tries to be ""the owner of AI"" is doomed to fail. AI is quickly becoming an open technology.

People are already running AI almost as powerful as GPT directly on their phones with open models ([https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20)). Also on their computers ([https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71](https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71)).

New, faster, better, more portable models are coming out every day (this came out just a few days and its 100x faster to train than GPT: [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)). Additionally, most of the innovation is coming out of small groups, independent researchers and tech enthusiasts at home. It's like the early days of home computing all over again.

🚨 Panic in Google-land 🚨

Rumors are swirling that Google employees are calling for Sundar Pichai to be replaced ASAP. The company is in full-blown panic mode, and their desperation is becoming more apparent with each passing day ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1))

A lot of the leadership of the most innovative programs are leaving Google ([https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3)). Like the head of VR who left to start his own AI company ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor))

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Google is on the ropes, and Bard's failures are just the tip of the iceberg. They're losing top talent to OpenAI, facing damning allegations, and their once-untouchable reputation is crumbling. The market will eventually catch up to these realities, and it's time for us to keep our eyes on the prize.

But investors who are looking at the confluence of China's re-opening, the competition between Beijing and Washington, and the explosion of opportunity in AI might want to turn their attention to Baidu. The Chinese version of Google announced that their own AI chatbot, ERNIE, will launch in March, and shares jumped 12% on the news.

# All about ERNIE

It stands for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration and it's a large language model created by Baidu back in 2019. What sets it apart from other language models is its ability to integrate knowledge with massive amounts of data, making its understanding and generation skills next level.

It's evolved into a series of advanced big models that can handle all sorts of tasks, like language understanding, language generation, and even text-to-image generation.

The CTO, Haifeng Wang, was hyping up deep learning as the core of AI in a presentation earlier this year and how it's showing major potential. And the Chairwoman of Baidu's Tech Committee, Hua Wu, was saying how AI-generated content could revolutionize film production.

173,Why hasn't META taken advantage of the AI trend?,1,1162spp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1162spp/why_hasnt_meta_taken_advantage_of_the_ai_trend/,43,1676785408.0,"I'm curious as to why Meta hasn't taken any steps to ride the hot-wave of AI and the AI war going on between MSFT and GOOG. As far as I'm aware, isn't Meta similarly positioned in terms of R&D and AI technology? Are they purposely keeping it under wraps for whatever reason? If they disclosed they were also going to launch some kind of AI software to the public, I feel like a lot of people would realize how well-positioned they are in the field of AI, rather than being focused only on the metaverse, which has been a contentious topic for most. But I think AI on the other hand would fare quite well considering how people are crazed over it currently.

I sent this post as a prompt into ChatGPT, and this was its answer...

*Meta, formerly Facebook, has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years. In fact, many of the most innovative and high-profile AI applications have been developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), which is the company's dedicated AI research division. Some of FAIR's key contributions to the field of AI include advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, among others.*

*However, Meta's strategy and priorities as a company are not solely focused on AI. While AI is certainly an important part of their technological arsenal, they have also been investing heavily in other areas such as virtual and augmented reality, as well as the Metaverse, which they see as the next major computing platform.*

*In terms of Meta's approach to disclosing their AI capabilities, it is worth noting that many of the most significant advances in AI are often kept under wraps until they are ready for commercial deployment. This is because the field of AI is highly competitive, and companies are often trying to gain a strategic advantage over their competitors. Additionally, there are also concerns around the potential ethical implications of AI, which may lead companies to be cautious about how they disclose their research.*

*Overall, while Meta is certainly a major player in the field of AI, they are also pursuing a wide range of other technological innovations, and it is likely that their AI research will continue to play an important but relatively quiet role in their broader strategy.*

Furthermore, I asked it about specifics of their AI R&D and comparatively to their current competitive counterpart:

*Meta (formerly Facebook) has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years, and their efforts have resulted in a number of high-profile applications and contributions to the field of AI. Here are a few examples:*

1. *Computer Vision: Meta's computer vision research has led to the development of a number of innovative applications, including automatic image and video captioning, face recognition, and object detection. One particularly noteworthy contribution is the development of the DeepMask and SharpMask algorithms, which are used for high-quality object segmentation in images.*
2. *Natural Language Processing: Meta has made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) through its work on the Transformers architecture. Transformers is a deep learning model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis.*
3. *Reinforcement Learning: Meta has also made important contributions to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Their RL research has led to the development of advanced algorithms for game playing and other tasks.*

*These are just a few examples of the many areas in which Meta has made important contributions to AI research. In terms of how they compare to other major players in the field, here are a few thoughts:*

* *OpenAI: Like Meta, OpenAI is a major player in the field of AI research, and has made important contributions in a variety of areas. However, OpenAI's focus is somewhat different, as they are specifically dedicated to advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity. This has led them to focus on areas such as reinforcement learning and generative models, as well as research into the potential societal implications of AI.*
* *Microsoft: Microsoft is also heavily invested in AI research, and has made significant contributions in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One notable example is the development of the GPT series of language models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of NLP tasks.*
* *Google: Like Meta, Google has made important contributions to AI research in a wide range of areas. Some of their most notable contributions include the development of the TensorFlow machine learning framework, as well as advances in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.*

*Overall, all of these companies are major players in the field of AI research, and each brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table. Meta's research is notable for its focus on computer vision and NLP, as well as their work on the Metaverse and virtual reality.*

It would seem like just a matter of time before they announce something that directly or indirectly competes with Google and Microsoft too, maybe an avatar chatbot AI you can see in VR/AR? That would be pretty cool.

And from there you can quickly see where it would go. Immersive experiences with AI generated content:

I think one path of the AI and metaverse will be influencer and celebrity avatars powered by AI. Have you seen on Twitch, the AI streamers, which are based on the input of all of the footage and recorded videos of the streamer? It's fascinating what the implications are, but imagine you could meet your favorite Twitch streamer, or movie celebrity powered by AI in the metaverse.

In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.

You could become an avatar, in Avatar, or become Neo in the Matrix, lol.

Powered by Meta, of course."

# Meta Platforms ($META)

Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.

Investors have also cheered the company’s aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta’s prospects.

Meta’s user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps –Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.

**Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company’s AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta’s positioning within the digital ads space.

## Amazon ($AMZN)

Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company’s retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS’s growth.

Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN’s rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon’s ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.

**Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**

Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company’s AI market position “diminish.”

Recent channel checks by Lee’s firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS’s generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.

“Case studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,” said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.

## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.

Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix’s business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.

**What is the Price Target for Netflix?**

On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.

Prior to the announcement, the analyst’s firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for “remote” users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.

While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for “remote” users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.

# Conclusion

Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon’s AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space."
175,OpenAI's Business Strategy - What is their Eng Game?,0,11zkkqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11zkkqg/openais_business_strategy_what_is_their_eng_game/,8,1679578424.0,"OpenAI has exploded on the scene primarily due to the popularity of its chat GPT product. Let's take a second and look over their overall goals, their investments, some of the outcomes they're trying to achieve from their campaigns, and some of the projects they're currently focused on.

OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Reed Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Elon Musk, and others. Elon Musk resigned from the board in 2018, right before OpenAI started a second branch which is a capped for-profit. However, the organization started as a non-profit and created its capped for-profit to attract talent and additional investment from corporate entities like Microsoft.

As an organization, its mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) and AI systems that are generally smarter than humans benefit all of humanity. To that end, they commit to following principles around broadly distributing benefits. They've committed to using the influence they obtain over AGI deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all and to avoid enabling users of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power. They share that their primary fiduciary duty is to humanity and want to empower society to flourish in the universe maximally.

AGI can accelerate its progress and cause significant changes to happen suddenly, even if the transition starts slowly. They expect it to happen quickly in the final stages. Some people in the AI field think that the risks of AGI and successor systems are fictitious, and they share they'll generally be delighted if that turns out to be correct. Still, they're going to operate as if these risks are existential. In particular, they think it's vital that society agrees on a vast balance of how AI can be used, but individual users have a lot of discretion within those bounds. They believe in empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the inherent power of the diversity of ideas.

As mentioned, they have a non-profit that governs their overall operations for the good of humanity. They have bylaws that can override any for-profit interests, including letting them cancel their equity obligations to shareholders for safety concerns and helping them push the experiment on AGI. Their charter has a clause to assist other organizations and advanced safety instead of racing with them in the late stages of AGI development. It is a different way of competing vs. cooperating with other organizations to help them successfully iterate on AGI.

As they successfully create more powerful systems, they want to deploy them and gain experience operating them in the real world. They expect OpenAI to have a gradual transition that gives people, policymakers, and institutions time to understand what's happening, personally experience the benefits and downsides of the systems, and adapt our economy and put regulations in place. This will also allow society and AI to co-evolve and for people to collectively figure out what they want. At the same time, as stakes are relatively low, they believe that democratized access will also lead to more and better research, decentralized power, more benefits, and a broader set of people contributing to new ideas.

They also believe the best way to navigate AI deployment challenges successfully is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration. Their decisions require much more caution than society usually applies to new technologies and are more risk-averse than many users would like. Successfully transitioning to a world with superior intelligence is perhaps human history's most important, hopeful, and scary project. They don't expect the future to be an unqualified Utopia, but they want to maximize the good and minimize the bad and for AGI to be an amplifier for humanity. Because the upside of AGI is so significant, they do not believe it is possible or desirable for society to stop development forever. Instead, they feel that the community and the developers of AGI have to figure out how to get it right. Although they can't predict precisely what will happen, and of course, their current progress could hit a wall, they can articulate the principles they care about the most.

AGI has the potential to give everyone incredible new capabilities, and they can imagine a world where all users have access to help with almost any cognitive task, providing a significant force multiplier for human ingenuity and creativity. Because the upside of AGI is so substantial, they've also shared that they want to carefully bring it into existence with the world in a transitional and thoughtful manner rather than just a sudden one.

As we mentioned earlier about their non-profit governing the organization's overall operations, they do have a cap on returns for their for-profit that their shareholders can earn so that they aren't incentivized to attempt to capture value without bound and risk deploying something potentially catastrophically dangerous. And, of course, as a way to share benefits with society, they've attempted to structure in addition to these new areas in a way that aligns their incentives with a good outcome. 

Generally speaking, AI will lead to significant progress, and they want to promote it by putting models and APIs out there through open-source means. Although they have closed some access to their research, they still generally will try to provide as much information to the public as possible through their non-profit charter. On the other hand, AGI could also come with severe risks of misuse, accidents, and social and societal disruption. They will attempt to build safe and beneficial AGI directly but will also consider their mission fulfilled if their work aids in achieving this, to help others achieve this outcome.

Long-term safety being a paramount focus for the organization, they are committed to doing research that requires making AGI safe and driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI communities. They anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill their mission. Still, they will always diligently act and minimize conflicts of interest among their employees and stakeholders that could compromise overall benefits.

They feel that society will face important questions about what AI systems can do, how to obtain acceptance, combat bias, deal with job displacement, and more. At some point, the balance between the upsides and downsides of deployment, such as empowering malicious actors, creating social and economic disruption, and accelerating an unsafe race, could shift, significantly changing their plans around continuous deployment. Lastly, they hope for a global conversation about how to govern these systems, fairly distribute the benefits they generate, and fairly share access.

They are also developing steerable models to help build and iterate on the GPT product safely and consistently. Their first shift models like this happened in GPT-3 as early examples. Their eventual hope is that institutions worldwide agree on these wide bounds. In shorter terms, as the OpenAI, the default setting of their products will likely be quite constrained, but they plan to make it easy for users to change the behavior of the AI that they're using. 

As mentioned earlier, they are concerned about the late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race, needing more time to apply safety precautions adequately. Therefore, if a value-aligned safety concern project comes close to building AGI, as they have previously, they commit to stopping competing and start assisting others towards building and contributing to this project."

(BIDU) is planning to roll out an artificial intelligence chatbot service similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to a person familiar with the matter, potentially China’s most prominent entry in a race touched off by the tech phenomenon. 

China’s largest search engine company plans to debut a ChatGPT-style application in March, initially embedding it into its main search services, said the person, asking to remain unidentified discussing private information. The tool, whose name hasn’t been decided, will allow users to get conversation-style search results much like OpenAI’s popular platform.

The company’s shares rose as much as 5.8% after Bloomberg’s report, the largest intraday gain in almost four weeks. 

Baidu has spent billions of dollars researching AI in a years-long effort to transition from online marketing to deeper technology. Its Ernie system — a large-scale machine-learning model that’s been trained on data over several years — will be the foundation of its upcoming ChatGPT-like tool, the person said. A Baidu representative declined to comment.

180,IonQ Pursues a Revolutionary Step in AI: Striving to Develop Quantum Machine Learning Models Matching Human Cognitive Abilities,0,13z5osk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13z5osk/ionq_pursues_a_revolutionary_step_in_ai_striving/,16,1685780136.0,"  
IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  
In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.  
Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).

181,Citadel Ken Griffin sees near term generative AI impact a hype,0,143aw3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/143aw3b/citadel_ken_griffin_sees_near_term_generative_ai/,35,1686138114.0,"The Founder and CEO of Citadel, Ken Griffin thinks that artificial intelligence  will be transformative one day but the hype around the technology currently is overblown.

""I do think the AI community is making a terrible mistake by being full of hype on the near-term implications of generative AI,"" said Griffin at an event for Citadel's new class of interns in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Griffin also said that the fear of AI ending skilled jobs was far from reality.

In the past few months, AI has been the talk of the town with several companies announcing initiatives to get a piece of the technology. Earlier this month, Nvidia briefly made it to the $1T market cap as the stock rode a wave of investor exuberance surrounding AI.

Following the release of Microsoft -backed OpenAI's ChatGPT — which takes written inputs from users and provides human-like response — Chinese companies including Alibaba (BABA), SenseTime (OTCPK:SNTMF) and Baidu (BIDU) have launched their own generative AI services. Even Google's (GOOGL) (GOOG) AI technology is also set to power online travel agency Priceline's virtual travel tool, as per a report.

According to a recent study, Chinese organizations have launched 79 large language models ((LLMs)) in the past three years in an effort to boost their AI technology capabilities.

Here’s the problem with large language models: they are built on the past, everything we do is about the future,"" added Griffin, according to the report. ""We are at the start of the journey of large language models.""

However, Griffin noted that it will have real impact in the economy."
182,The next AI stock to moon ($FDS),0,129js4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/129js4w/the_next_ai_stock_to_moon_fds/,26,1680438364.0,"**TL:DR;** FDS provides financial info like Bloomberg. Bloomberg recently announced their [own AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). AI only goes up.

FactSet (FDS) is well-positioned to take advantage of the current AI hype in the financial data analysis space. With over [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog, FDS has a vast array of data and services that could be enhanced by partnering with an AI language model like ChatGPT. Moreover, FDS has already made strides in natural language processing (NLP) with their [Factset Query Language](https://go.factset.com/hubfs/Website_Downloads/Statistical%20Package%20Integration/Docs%203.0/TipsandTechniques.pdf) (FQL), which allows users to make natural language queries to financial data. However, FDS could further improve their NLP capabilities by leveraging the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) which Bloomberg has recently done with [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/). This could enable FDS to develop more sophisticated natural language interfaces and improve the accuracy and speed of financial data analysis. Additionally, FDS has a strong reputation in the financial data space and is one of the few publicly traded companies that provide financial data, making it an attractive partner for AI language models and financial institutions looking for reliable data sources.

FDS hasn’t confirmed that they’re using LLMs yet, but they probably are given that they mention GPT in a [job posting](https://factset.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FactSetCareers/details/Machine-Learning-Engineer_R13291?q=GPT&__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=5bad2784-dc05-40fe-a68d-fee1a12cdc9b%7C397e76f1-32f7-4fbf-bd20-d38c0c14c7a9). They also have several blog posts on ChatGPT [as](https://insight.factset.com/chatgpt-and-decarbonizing-the-railroads) [well](https://insight.factset.com/understanding-chatgpt-the-promise-and-nuances-of-large-language-models).

FDS can leverage its [96 APIs](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog) in their catalog in a similar way to WolframAlpha’s collaboration with OpenAI. If they hook it up with ChatGPT or something similar, it can use these APIs to do financial analysis just like how [WolframAlpha enables ChatGPT to do math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOQV9VakBgE). It also allows the user to provide a query in natural language instead of needing to know how to code/read the API.

Just like the Bloomberg Query Language, FDS has Factset Query Language (FQL). FQL allows making interaction with financial data to be more natural. For example, “Show me companies with sales greater than the average sales of companies in the S&P 500.” would translate to “FF_SALES(ANN,0)>UAVG(FG_CONSTITUENTS(SP50,0,CLOSE),FF_SALES(ANN,0))”. This feature allows users to ask queries in plain language without needing to write complex code or have extensive knowledge of financial terms.

One thing to worry about is AI “hallucinations” in which the AI provides inaccurate information which would obviously be bad for financial analysts. There are two types of hallucinations: open-domain, and closed-domain. Closed-domain hallucinations refer to situations where the AI makes something up, but the information was already in its context. A good example of this is asking ChatGPT to summarize something, but it provides an extra detail that was never given. Research shows good progress on reducing closed-domain hallucinations via [clever prompting and reward model training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf). If you watch the WolframAlpha demo, they mention working with OpenAI to create a special version of GPT4, and it shows since it is reliably using WolframAlpha’s output. The same techniques can be done for FDS’s APIs to reduce inaccuracies.

Just like every other AI stock that has gone up by an absurd amount, once FDS announces usage of ChatGPT, it’s going to moon. Some of the AI stocks are just regarded and don’t make any sense, but FDS is a legit use-case, so it has long term prospects as well."

184,XMTR – Cheap AI Stock. Great Upside Potential. This One’s Gonna Be Good.,0,1498hx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1498hx4/xmtr_cheap_ai_stock_great_upside_potential_this/,31,1686750830.0,"*I’m a selfish bastard, so I usually don’t give away my best ideas but fuck it I could use the karma. Besides, my wife is on vacation with her boyfriend, so I had a lot of time to myself to actually do some quality due-diligence on this stock.*

**The Headline**

Xometry (XMTR) is a massively underappreciated play on how AI is going to change manufacturing – and it’s pretty fuckin cheap right now.

**For Those of You Who Have a Fourth Grade Reading Level**

· XMTR connects the people who design shit with the people who can actually make that shit.

· They operate in a ~~$2,000,000,000,000~~ total addressable market.

· They use AI with better data than anyone else in the field (good moat).

· They have faced some short-term headwinds that have made the stock cheap (for now).

**The Business**

· XMTR has created a marketplace to connect product developers (NASA, BMW, Dell, SpaceX, you name it.) with manufacturers for custom parts manufacturing. This process used to be done through local connections, but, with XMTR's platform, this can be done much faster, cheaper, and at greater volume.

· They are doing this in a ginormous total addressable market sized at $2 trillion for global manufacturing where they only had revenue of $381 million for all of last year (but grew 75%!).

· XMTR is a newer company and in the early innings of user awareness where they have seen customers in industries from electric vehicle manufacturers, aerospace and defense, pharmaceuticals, consumer technology all grow spend at compounded annual growth rates between 121% up to 993%.

· Being the outright winner as a marketplace/having a first mover advantage is important as you can see with AirBnb, Amazon, and Uber who have won early to create significant value from digitizing their markets. Looking back, wouldn’t you have invested in Amazon at Day 1?

· This is playing out as competitors like [Fast Radius](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chicago-tech-company-fast-radius-files-for-chapter-11-after-the-spac-deal-216941/) and [Shapeway’s](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/shapeways-hit-with-nyse-non-compliance-notice-for-failing-to-meet-listing-standards-214028/) have either gone bankrupt or are very close.

**AI & Positive Feedback Loops**

· So, what’s the special sauce? [Artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/) and machine learning. They continue to create a positive feedback loop where every buyer attracts more sellers and thus attracts more buyers. For those of you who haven't attended an intro to business webinar like I have, this phenomenon is called a network effect.

· This entire flywheel is powered by the droves of quality data they are collecting. Proper pricing, matching, and lead times between product developers and the 625,000 manufacturers in the USA alone is difficult and takes YEARS to develop since it has never been done before.

· While they have had some hiccups that hurt near term numbers and caused some bears to huddle up, they now have better data and algorithms than anyone else in the market and have better trained their machines which keeps competitors from coming anywhere close to competing with them. I love a good moat, don’t you?

*\*NOT TO MENTION\* there are 10,000 owners of manufacturing shops retiring and selling their businesses every day to engineers that understand and have a use for XMTR’s tech offering.*

**A Good Deal**

· NVIDIA (NVDA) is trading at 20x sales and XMTR is at \~ 2x sales. At 1/10th the price but growing 70% faster over the last 12 months, XMTR is the AI play of a century (wow!).

· Short interest ratio at 11% and moving upwards as bears are peaking their heads out of the forest to push this thing back up to 20% again.

· Their bearish sentiments are wrong, and we’ll be handsomely rewarded for our contrarianism.

*Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice, it’s my advice – take that as you will. What you should know: I’m a tard. Some of you might think my analysis is on the shorter side, but what I would say is that sometimes the best of things only require the shortest of descriptions to demonstrate their value.

185,What's up with Microsoft's poor execution?,0,1146ap4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1146ap4/whats_up_with_microsofts_poor_execution/,53,1676595051.0,"Microsoft (MSFT) recently invested a lot of money into openai which is a good product but lacks monetisation and is seemingly unprofitable as most of the value it provides doesn't go back to the company hosting the AI, ChatGPT. 

Then, when they integrated ChatGPT into bing it still suffered from mistakes and issues like Microsoft's old AI such as ""going crazy"". Not to mention it's inaccessible to most of the public why launch it at all. After ""making Google dance"" they made the same mistakes.

This has been a problem with Microsoft with gaming as well. They buy large companies and IPs but can't produce good games. 

One example is Halo: Infinite where a combination of bad leads, contracting mistakes and dropping the ball on marketing led to a product that many enjoyed but still not good enough to set records despite being a record setting game for its budget. This led to it leaving a lot of money on the table. 

I just don't get why Microsoft can't seem to get it's shit together they could be so much more valuable as a company if they were able to execute. Don't get me wrong it's been performing well and even growing and I even own the stock this isn't a knock on Microsoft I just think it could be better."

Will bing begin a new era?

According to Microsoft bing is 140% quicker and more efficient using 2.9GB of RAM compared to Google’s 3.1GB of RAM at 60 tabs open (weather Microsoft exaggerated this data by using optimal situations I don’t know. But is proven correct to an extent)

If you can’t live without your chrome extensions you can add them to bing as well. And it is not hard to transfer your bookmarks

So what is stoping bing dominating search? I’m going to guess that people don’t like changing or trust Google more."

During the Dot Com era dial up was the primary internet. Most homes didn’t have a computer or cell phones and Robinhood didn’t exist. Today we have fiber optic internet. More information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime. You can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food. Get anything you want, when you want it. If the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place, the bust may never have happened.

A primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 1998–99 allowing LOTS of startups to open with cheap money/borrowing. We don’t have that now and AI is still thriving.

Most companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom.

This isn’t the same. AI has been around for a while, for example IBM’s Watson, Apple’s SIRI, Amazon’s Alexa, the GPS reading the route instructions to you or Microsoft word checking your grammar and spelling on word documents. This is AI like it or not. We’ve gotten so used to them we don’t even think of them as AI. ChatGPT is just another tool in the toolbox and it still has a LONG way to go before its good.

Most companies will take a while to implement AI as it has to be perfect when it’s released and people are trained to work with AI not for AI. For example when you order at Wendy’s and the AI bot can’t seem to get your order right, people need to be there to step in. Or when you reach out to your bank to get transaction details and the bot doesn’t understand, a person needs to be there.

A lot of the existing companies on the front lines of the AI revolution (NVDA,Intel, AMD, etc.) are seasoned companies with a long history of revenue. AI development and integration into the economic system (Education, Industrial, Medical, Customer Service, Agriculture, Finance, Media, Transportation, etc) is a great source of growth for all these companies and it’s a great opportunity for new companies to emerge and make our lives easier.

Everyone that has a job today can think of ATLEAST one way AI can improve what they do to make work easier.

This is the AI Revolution, The Artificial Intelligence Age, a new frontier. Not a bubble."

Here comes Google's cannibalization problem. If Google releases and focuses on developing Bard, what happens to its search engine business (cash cow)? These challenges give rise to the innovator's dilemma. OpenAI has nothing to lose (at first it was a non-profit) but has a lot to gain. Hence its massive sprint. What next for Alphabet's stock?
