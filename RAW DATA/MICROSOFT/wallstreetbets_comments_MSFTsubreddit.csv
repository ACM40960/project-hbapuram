When people see DD flared posts they‚Äôre expecting effort. 

I‚Äôm thinking of the uranium post a few months back. The poster looked at the price, and saw it was low. Saw the mines were operating at a loss. That nuclear reactors were being planned in Europe due to the war in Ukraine and wanting to no longer be dependent on Russian oil. 

Gave tickers. Of mining companies, and ETF‚Äôs. Noted which companies sat on big piles of uranium, and which were bound by certain laws making it harder. Said it would be a long term play.

Your post was essentially: 
1. IV not priced in
2. AI so hot right now 
3. My positions

You could‚Äôve tried showing how Microsoft‚Äôs stock has moved when it has unveiled past projects (many of which are now discontinued), and averaged it. Or based hypothetical movement on the investment size Microsoft made, and comparing that to similar sized investments Microsoft made in previous projects and how that changed their price. 

I understand AI is less developed and more new than Uranium mining. But your post was minimal effort.

Without insider trading, you by definition don't have all of the information that the market has, and again, by definition, you can't make truly informed decisions.

Hedge funds, with actual borderline insider trading, with hyper-favorable trading instruments available exclusively to them, with literal floors full of math wizards making $800,000+ a year doing nothing but risk analysis, playing with other peoples money, barely beat the market. 

Actual, for-real, literal inside traders (politicians) who get information months before it goes live and can *actually* change the laws that affect that insider knowledge, only beat the market by like 20% on average.

I knew I was right.

Then it started slowly going up. Immediately bought calls. Stock nearly doubles over the next two weeks.  It never returned to the low levels I posted my DD at.  Even if calls were bought the day I posted the DD, if they were at least one month out they‚Äôd have printed serious tendies.

Ever since 1958 with the perceptron, researchers and inventors would make bold claims ‚ÄúAI will solve an unsolved mathematical hypothesis and beat the world champion chess player within 5 years‚Äù. And I mean, you don‚Äôt have to dig super deep into the researchers bias to figure out why they would say that. I would too.


Of course, these things did eventually come true, but they took like 50 years and not 5. And I think AI is actually useful unlike some bullshit like the meta verse, but I like to be cautious about what any openai researcher or ceo or whatever says. History doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but it does rhyme, and in my opinion I think this could be a good example.

You grow twice as much food with the same amount of labor. In fact, given Open AI's non/capped profit status, Altman's one of the few people that wouldn't get particularly rich off of AI.

Lastly, the housing crisis made a bunch of regular people fabulously rich before the entire market crashed. Americans still think every person should be able to own a home, no matter how broke or uncreditworthy they are. The whole market crashed because Alan Greenspan, Bill Clinton, and the 1990s Republican Congress essentially gave every American subsidized loans to buy houses that they later couldn't pay back. Banks thought housing loans were completely safe, but they were much riskier than anyone thought. No one would have made those loans without those government subsidies in the first place. 

The college debt crisis is exactly the same problem. Bad students got huge loans to go to terrible, expensive college to study useless subjects. Now they can't afford to pay them back. We can frame healthcare as a similar issue where people with average to terrible personal health habits are kept alive much longer than anyone expected due to remarkable, but ultra-expensive advances in medicine.

Anytime you distort the free market with taxes (sticks) or subsidies (carrots) you end up with inefficiencies. The best case scenario is that they quickly blow up in to a huge bubble. The worst case scenario is that they are a massive drag on economic growth for decades.

If you're going to give some a loan to subsidize homeownership, college education, or healthcare, don't bother. Just give them cash and let them decide how they want to spend it. And if someone wants to use that cash in ways you think are bad, that's fine. If they want to drop out of school, do drugs, get fat, and die young, let them. The conditions should be set upfront to get the cash, not after they've already blown it. You should bear the risk, not them.",t3_12hnwvh,1681160643.0,-1

I stopped reading there because that's such a ridiculous statement. The fact that productivity increases doesn't guarantee that the benefits will be evenly distributed or even distributed at all.

If you look at the past 40 years, the top 1% has captured almost all the extra wealth created by rising productivity. Average Americans have benefited very little. Poor Americans are worse off than they were then.


I'm old enough to have witnessed the rise of trickle down economics and it's a flawed idea that goes contrary to human nature. If you let rich people take more, they're not going to spend it on goods and services produced by the rest of us. Rich people don't willingly give away their money. Instead they'll accumulate more wealth, then use that wealth to cement their power (i.e. buy politicians) and get laws passed that let them take even more.

Take computer programmers for example. They still need a Product Manager who owns the product strategy and proposes a new piece of software.

Then the programmer will most likely use AI to help create the code, but will still need to test and debug the software. Then multiple iterations of this loop as they get feedback from customers etc. 

I see AI making jobs more efficient and effective, not necessarily replacing a bunch of people. AI will help software become even more prolific.

But it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.

The legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. 

The job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.

That is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.

That being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.

Companies lose billions on heat and space - Why else do you think they keep coming up with crazy ways to solve the heat, space issues.

Whether it's building server farms in frozen tundra's to combat heat buildup, or companies like Google trying to save space by loading servers onto ships that would just float idly off the coast.

Now instead of buying a goddamn barge, loading it with servers, and floating it down the Mississippi Delta, you just call up NVDA and order a compact God-machine that has 300 interconnected GPUS, paired with 144 **TERABYTES** of memory, that you can stuff into a large closet. GG

Generative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It‚Äôs a cool new application that people can experience first hand.

But what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?

The reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, they all follow each other. There‚Äôs nothing new about it and it‚Äôs a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.

This is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there‚Äôs an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We‚Äôre seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it‚Äôs only getting started.

Think back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it‚Äôs very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it‚Äôs very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.

To me it‚Äôs a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren‚Äôt realizing that a lot of the crazes we‚Äôve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.

But labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It‚Äôs probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It‚Äôd be like calling the Industrial Revolution ‚Äúa rail bubble‚Äù.",t3_146ywtf,1686546324.0,1

What is new is the hardware (Tensocores) that accelerate it and the ability to use many of them to create large models became commoditized and not lab experiments.  It will make the average PC user a power user. It will take repetitive tasks, learn how you do them, and create much faster workflows. It will make all data available to all programs by being able to translate, merge and clean heterogenous datasets on the fly.   This is HUGE.

Yes, there are ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù against hallucination, but their effectiveness is way overhyped.

Not really. 

There was a post in the ChatGPT subreddit where ChatGPT said something like ""1+1=2"" and the human ""corrected"" it, saying 1+1 actually equals 3; the bot apologized and said ""You're right, 1+1 does indeed equal 3,"" or something to that effect.

Similarly, there's a post where the bot insists Queen Elizabeth was still alive and refused to be corrected.

Finally, another post where after a gentle question asking for additional citations of an incorrect claim, since the original citations were from dubious websites, the bots response was testy and it ended the conversation there; something like, ""I provided my sources. You can check them yourself. I don't appreciate your tone and am ending this conversation here.""

I am skeptical the lower hallucinations from GPT3 to 4 are due to any improvement in architecture. I think they just trained it on much more stuff.

I don‚Äôt doubt when a sufficiently cost effective AI can be purchased/licensed they‚Äôll take the same tact to cut headcount. And we‚Äôre just a random small cap mom and pop shop.

I disagree that high level knowledge work is the safest. It will be the actual inverse. Anything that draws on YeARs Of EXpeRIeNcE to be expert, and has a readily accessible large data set of prior inputs and outcomes, can be fed into an LLM and create an adequate AI. 6 months ago, chatgpt couldn‚Äôt pass the bar: about 2-3 months ago it consistently tested a 70 (passing score). 

The difference now than previous attempts is that LLMs aren‚Äôt parroting or regurgitating information: the algorithms are learning to infer and deduce with rapid and exponential improvement. Inference and deduction is the core skill that all knowledge work derives its value from. Just like the first computer in the 1950s took an entire floor to be a glorified calculator, these first iterations are massive compute intensive designs that will be refined, made cheaper, and mass distributed over time.

As far as timelines, I think there will be substantial penetration of AI into the job market 10-15 years max.

also: isn‚Äôt advanced enough ‚Äúyet‚Äù

that said, I have no idea about Chegg. 7-8 years ago most international students I knew in Canada used local premium essay writers with some awareness of Chinese ESL and a capacity to write believable (from a mainland student in Canada 3-4 years) and very fast (overnight delivery) B+ essays 

the premium was paid for a service 

I would imagine Chegg needs to rely on more than ‚Äòengineering homework help‚Äô but maybe more personalized tutoring or basic product services such as textbook rentals 

i wouldn‚Äôt be especially long in any education services though as i think AI in general is going to reshape how we teach and test students. it‚Äôs hard to offer a service for an environment if you don‚Äôt know how the environment will look in 10 years.

context: i was an essay writer for years a long time ago. made a lot of money on it. knew a few guys that did too and one guy with a company in china that got pretty rich off it. i probably couldn‚Äôt do it now. most of my old consumer segment (rich chinese students) seem to all use chatgpt now.",t3_10v8lvq,1675698805.0,10

Do we really think ChatGPT will have the good judgement to know when it should and shouldn't be leaning on Wolfram Alpha?  Wolfram itself isn't very useful for modern algebra.  And the ChatGPT part will still give incorrect explanations even if the calculations are correct.  It's not even remotely as good as even a 3rd rate math tutor when it comes to actually learning from it even if it did have a more frequently correct probabilistic next token guess on problem sets.,t3_10v8lvq,1675776448.0,0

They essentially do highest probability next token prediction in LLMs... they're never going to learn the process for even simple addition of many tokens.  For any of these LLMs, try asking them to add 20 random integers, let's even limit them to be between 1 and 100.  They all fall flat on their faces and always will.  To see why, just do the combinations 100 choose 1 + 100 choose 1+... twenty times right.  The chances of that set of numbers in the summation being in the training data goes to zero.  That's why these models can guess two operand sums but start struggling really fast as the number of operands increases.  They don't know how to add.  When they show these models doing things like passing the Bar exam or med school exams... remember that there are oodles of example questions for these online.  Yeah, not identical to the new question, but pretty darn close so you can basically just format the answer the same way and get close enough on enough of them to pass.  This generalizes well enough from training to validation data per se... but to go from training to test is another story.  E.g. when I come up with my own super simple logic questions (seating assignment logic puzzles)... ChatGPT fails hard... and they were super super simple ones with just 3 seats.  It's also shit at tic tac toe, a simple solved game where the entire ideal moveset fits in a single XKCD strip.  LLMs are much less impressive than people realize.  They will most likely generate more work than they reduce as people start getting paid to try to 1) distinguish AI from human outputs and 2) to check AI outputs for correctness.

Knowledge-based questions, it does ok, it's grammatically good (so at it's core, it does what it was trained to pretty well), but you need to already know the answer to know when it is bullshitting, so ultimately useless for me.Yes, it can spit out some impressive looking code templates.  You can see that on Jason Turner's C++ Weekly where he gave it a very flattering showing.  It didn't do so hot when I asked it to use a less popular library, it was also pretty insistent on using immediate mode for OpenGL...  bizarre use of an internal library constant from htslib... I think it copied that bit out of the Rust interface code for the library.Many of the ""constraints"" are NOT restricting the model's potential, many of them effectively amount to censoring wrong outputs, which makes the model appear much more flattering.

And those jobs doing the checking cannot be reduced in the same manner, so youl wind up with still 4 people to do the work of 4 people, if you're lucky, though I suspect there will be productivity loss beyond that even.

How is it supposed to ""strategize"" without being able to solve simple seating problems?  It literally can't.""Do you actually work with them?"" Machine learning models generally, yes.  LLMs in particular, hell no, they're very much not appropriate for what I do.  Not that I don't have colleagues high on the hype train.  They'll come down from it eventually, they're always hyped like that over the newest models and they regularly fail to outperform old techniques in my area.  Freaking XGboost is failing to outperform simple heuristics in my field.  Not on training data, beautiful there, loss heads right for zero.  Not on validation data, you do parameter tuning and you'll find something that generalizes well to that.  But moving to from validation to real world testing in independent data... performance drops below that of the heuristic.  I'm only picking on ChatGPT this much because the hype is so high.  Several of the issues and reasons it isn't going to ""change everything"" are general to ML models, and just modeling in general.  More recent ML models also fail to outperform decades old Markov Chain models on other problems in my field.  And again, yes, they can do it on a data set, and often on an author's chosen validation set, but you take them to the real world on independent data and watch them faceplant.

""Transformational strengths""?  What would those be?  The models are grammatically good and semi-coherent.  I've already said as much previously.  They're good at the thing they were directly trained to do.  They're fairly good at next token prediction given a string of prior tokens.  I've never denied that.

**Best Buy BBY** \- 71p ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

\- NVIDIA mentioned in their earnings call that there is a reduced revenue or overall sales in PC/electronics. I believe this will affect Best Buy too

**Baidu (BIDU)** \- I bought calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

\- I have no idea I just wanted to gamble on China. JD's earnings were pretty good and considering Baidu is the Google of China I might as well risk it for the biscuit

**Crowdstrike CRWD** \- 195c

\- I'm just playing off the fact that PANW had a good earnings. Based on this I might consider playing Okta too depending on how things go for CRWD earnings

**Hewlett Packard HP** \- 30p

Dell bad earnings + NVIDIA sentiment makes me think the same for HP. Also not too sure why but every academic institution & place I worked at uses Dell instead of HP. Pure sentiment play

**CHWY** \- puts, strike price not decided

Petco had terrible earnings so that may not bode well for the rest of the sector

**Might consider playing but haven't decided:**

Overall:

-	RJ is the smartest CEO in the vehicle manufacturing space. Go listen to the ‚ÄúHow I Built This‚Äù podcast to get a sense for his journey to get to where he‚Äôs at. This is the #1 reason I‚Äôm bullish on them. Their first ever vehicle won countless accolades and awards and safety top picks. RJ gets a lot of credit for that, but he doesn‚Äôt crave the attention. He just gets shit done quietly. Dude has his PhD from MIT‚Äôs Auto Design division, and he did it because he knew he‚Äôd need credibility with investors to start a car company. 

-	They don‚Äôt currently have any real competition. They‚Äôre the only three row electric SUV on the market. Truck is after a different market than the F-150. Yes, competition is coming but Rivian just set the bar astronomically high.

-	Rivian has done very little / none demand gen marketing. It‚Äôs all been brand building. They‚Äôre not going to Tesla charging stations and offering test drives. (Ahem‚Ä¶. LCID) Their book of orders and order volume is solid at the moment. They don‚Äôt even have a referral program. Everyone else seems to be scrambling to drive orders.

-	They will eat Subarus lunch. All Subaru had to do was launch an electrified Forester/Outback/Ascent. Instead, we got the abomination that is the solterra. And they‚Äôve not really announced other plans. The R2 line (coming 2025/2026) will be lower priced and squarely targeted at the Crosstrek/Forester Market, presenting the first real competition the Model Y has had. 

-	their costs have been astronomical because they ramped three vehicles to production simultaneously. Doing just one (model 3) nearly bankrupted Tesla. Rivian‚Äôs now sitting on a fantastic foundation, has hella runway, and fantastic vehicles, all without a CEO who is constantly whining and drawing attention to himself in the public sphere.

-	I‚Äôm not seeing anywhere that suggests RJ has sold most of his stock. He bought another 40,000 shares in March of 2022 and Insiders aren‚Äôt buying a ton more, but I can‚Äôt find anything about them selling their shares. Sauce?

Positions: I‚Äôm holding a small bag by comparison to most highly regarded traders, but a bag nonetheless. (450 shares + an R1T)

Also, cost of goods sold has be 3x their revenue the last three quarters. They have a seriously long road to profitability. They also have negative free cash flow.

At the current rate, they have maybe 15 to 16 more months before they have to consider borrowing money a substantial amount of money.

If a million people want your truck, you have to build a million trucks to realize the potential revenue. Even with economies of scale, your per-unit costs will have a pretty high floor.

Yes, tangible assets can be sold off if the company collapses, but they also depreciate, and bankruptcy sales tend to involve fire sale price levels.",t3_13cn3hx,1683646121.0,1

Elon in comparison is delivering huge numbers.  Margin is high and he keeps putting out higher numbers.

2423,jjhhirj,t3_13cn3hx,"- ceo sold most of his shares
- Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from Tesla charging network
- self driving AI isn‚Äôt as far along (it sucks)
- Rivian is ending its delivery van contract with Amazon

These alone are enough to kill it. Apprehension to new electric car adoption is‚Ä¶.lack of range/inability to travel. Tesla fixed this, hence their growing adoption by petroleum fueled drivers. At this stage the consumer just expects to have that access to level of charging capability. Without access to those charging stations is the equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.

In product design and entrepreneurship one rule I‚Äôve heard over and over, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring something to market with incremental improvement. Don‚Äôt even bring 2‚Ä¶3‚Ä¶5x improvement. If you can‚Äôt improve things by 10-15x then no one is going to care.‚Äù And this rings true here. Self driving being on par is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù but no one will care, but‚Ä¶worse than the competition? People will care, and not in a good way. This is shooting your self in your other foot.

Ending the Amazon contract is an awful idea. Why? Social proof. Think about this. I show you a product and you go ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù and I respond with ‚Äúyeah Amazon is using this for their delivery fleet‚Äù I‚Äôd be willing to bet you stop for a second and take another look at what I showed you. I do realize this says ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù but this will get messy because of Amazons investment in the company. To make significant gain they need to end exclusivity and sign a contract with either UPS, FEDEX, DHL, or USPS. The latter runs the risk of being ‚Äútypecast‚Äù like the current mail truck is.

Overall Rivian could (and may need to) pivot into an electric delivery vehicle company and abandon consumer production for now until they get their shit together. Unfortunately they already have vehicles out and this would cause those vehicle prices to plummet. Another option would be to follow the Tesla blueprint - reduce output and create demand. Either way it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road.

Given that they are in ramp phase, they should be hitting new highs each quarter. Ideally, given the amount they have already burnt building their current factory, i would like to see them hit 75-80k cars produced this year. Their GA factory is a big money pit and any more mistakes made in ramping up the normal factory is just going to jeopardize the GA factory launch timelines.

On the Munroe tear down: first impressions are everything. Overbuild the car to begin with to get all the amazing awards and press. Get pitched as an amazing value (because they cost so much to make). Pare back (as they have been doing regularly - and frustratingly to the aftermarket) over time as failure modes are identified and designs are further refined.

Tesla is still viewed as ‚Äúluxury‚Äù to most folks because that‚Äôs how they launched. If Rivian becomes synonymous with high quality and good value at whatever price point, that‚Äôs a lot better for them in the long run.

If Rivian keeps cash burn at current levels and doesn‚Äôt increase revenue, they‚Äôve 2-3 years of runway yet. If they increase revenue or decrease burn (both I expect to see happen), that runway is a lot longer and gets them to R2.

Rivian's AWD beats the crap out of Subarus (I replaced a top-end 2017 Forester XT with a Rivian R1T, so I'm speaking from experience) and their marketing reasons (Dogs, Nature, Inclusivity) are on the same page. 

There's **a** segment of subaru buyers who buy for Reliability - [but Subarus also](https://www.torquenews.com/1084/most-reliable-car-brands-and-why-subaru-only-gets-honorable-mention) [aren't super reliable.](https://repairpal.com/reliability/subaru) Head gaskets going out is kinda a meme at this point.

The Subaru segment is ALSO super interested in sustainability, which is pretty core to Rivian's messaging.

So yeah. I'd wager once the R2 drops, any Crosstrek/Outback/Forester buyers will be cross-shopping that, and I would be shocked if there weren't a significant percentage of potential Ascent buyers also cross-shopping the R1S.

I thought Hyundai had the worst dealership network. But anyways, dealers are just notoriously bad at selling vehicles anyways but I bought my pickup on ford website and the dealer just rubber stamps the transaction, no negotiation needed.

Also, at least there's a network of service locations. There's a particular EV brand that just never seem to get their service centers right. So, there's a flip side to every coin.

how do you figure seeing how Texas has 0% personal income tax and California has a freaking 9.3% personal income tax on $57k of income (which is higher then the highest bracket is high tax states like Maryland).

edit: last guy blocked me after getting a sad last word post in so I can't respond to this thread anymore (though there's a SOLID chance you know that). So by ""tons of articles"" you guys mean ""here's one article where the analysis by Wallethub is so flawed half the article is dedicated to explaining that"". 

Most people making 75k-80k a year aren't going to own a house. If you live in a city you won't own a car. So to the OP redditors are actually MASSIVELY better off in Texas then they would be in California. At least until they start purchasing property (even that's up in the air though cause your own article points out that wallethub didn't take into account how much cheaper homes are in California but who cares that's not the narrative your trying to shove down people's throat).",t3_13cn3hx,1683656559.0,5

3071,j9vt7dr,t3_11b0zz8,"Last week anyone who listened to me on Wayfair puts made money.  This week I‚Äôm buying Kohls (KSS) puts.  The thesis is quite simple.  KSS is buried in inventory.  Freight (both ocean bound and truck) cost an insane amount to get to the warehouse.  Q4 was especially price competitive as most of the industry had too much inventory.  

Q1 has had fire sale prices.  We‚Äôre talking Eddie Bauer, Nike; Adidas apparel for $10-$15.  This leads me to believe that they missed Q4 sales or at the very least Q4 gross margin %.  

As a bonus, this is the first conference call with the new CEO.  I expect him to say that they‚Äôve got to reduce their old inventory to make room for their new strategy giving guidance that Q1 margins will be low. 

Position: Short shares, 3/3 $30 puts, 4/21 $25 puts for the gamblers.  

I don‚Äôt expect a big move like Wayfair‚Äôs, but IV is more reasonable.  KSS isn‚Äôt headed to BK like Wayfair.  They‚Äôve just got a painful inventory and margin problem to work through.  Consensus estimate is an EPS of $0.98.  I expect closer to $0.50 with an outside shot of $0.25 or lower.

Here‚Äôs a variety of subreddits talking about the low prices.  I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any margin here.

So could fall a lot further if they announce poor numbers. But if they were to beat could see it rocket if enough are expecting a bad time. Market is def a casino though, so who knows.

3441,ja78fwq,t1_ja5zzea,"Definitely not a slam dunk.  It‚Äôs almost March.  The new CEO could say they‚Äôve made significant progress on reducing inventory in Q1.  We‚Äôve got one more bad quarter, then we expect year over year gross margins to be up 1000 bps due to lower freight costs and improved inventory levels.  We‚Äôre also going to explore unlocking billions of dollars in cash by selling and leasing back our real estate.  We‚Äôll use that cash to buyback 25% of shares outstanding and pay off the debt maturing 2023-2025. 

It‚Äôs not what I think will happen, but it might be what I‚Äôd say as the CEO on my first call with a new company.",t3_11b0zz8,1677494496.0,3
3442,j9ysnsx,t1_j9wqfp3,"I think we‚Äôll see  net income fall considerably short of expectations.  KSS is drowning in inventory and will have discounted to razor thin margins.  I also think their CEO and board of directors installed by Macellum Capital doesn‚Äôtmind if they tank the share price while they clear out inventory.

Macellum tried to get the company to sell out to private equity.  The board of directors fought it off.  Macellum got directors added to the board and brought in their own CEO.  Since then, they‚Äôve borrowed to buy back shares and paid out almost all of the profits as dividends.  The share price has fallen 50%.

I think they‚Äôll continue to make moves that drop the share price but clean up the inventory.  Then they‚Äôll make a bid to take the company private.  With their board seats and CEO, they‚Äôll get it approved.  Once private, they‚Äôll do a sale and lease back of the real estate.  The cash generated will have paid for the acquisition.  They‚Äôll cut costs, let the high interest 2025 debt mature, and sell down inventory.  Then with improved metrics, they‚Äôll bring the company back public and pocket the entire IPO as profit.  After cost cutting, the new lean company will be vulnerable to whatever tough market is next.  They‚Äôll hit a bump and be unable to service debt, but Macellum won‚Äôt care because they‚Äôll have already banked billions.

It‚Äôs classifying text with sentiment. Models have existed for this for over a decade. And what exactly is said, ‚Äústatistical relationship?‚Äù There are many potentially misleading results by vague ‚Äústatistical relationships.‚Äù

How does it compare to existing sentiment model performance?

> I can make an educated guess that the market reaction was negative, as investors may have expected a more aggressive rate hike to combat inflation or a more dovish stance to support growth. A higher federal funds rate means higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could dampen economic activity and earnings. A lower demand for bonds could also lower their prices and raise their yields, which could affect other interest rates and asset prices. A negative market reaction could also reflect a loss of confidence in the Fed‚Äôs ability to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

Powell cited excessive speculation and volatility resulting from the widespread use of options, particularly in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, as a key factor driving higher prices for goods and services. He hinted at the possibility of more rate hikes to address inflationary pressures.

In an unconventional move, Powell also announced that the Federal Reserve will be partnering with ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, to provide insights and recommendations on monetary policy to counter the looming recession. While some see this as an innovative approach, concerns have been raised about the accuracy and biases of ChatGPT's predictions, as well as the potential lack of human judgment in policy decisions. Rumors of Nancy Pelosi's alleged purchase of ChatGPT shares have also raised concerns about conflicts of interest.

As the U.S. economy continues to face challenges, Powell's remarks and the Federal Reserve's collaboration with ChatGPT have generated both optimism and skepticism about the use of artificial intelligence in shaping monetary policy and addressing economic issues. The implications of these developments will likely be a subject of ongoing debate among economists and policymakers.

ChatGPT: Sure, I can certainly analyze the financial news headlines and provide my outlook on the market. Please provide me with the headlines.

Me: 1. Elon Musk says Twitter had many employees but little product development

2. Apple partners with Goldman Sachs on high-yield savings account

3. Ryan Reynolds becomes investor in Nuvei fintech company

4. EU may struggle to catch up with U.S., Asia in chips subsidies race

5. LARRY KUDLOW: McCarthy & Co will have a strong debt ceiling package

ChatGPT: Based on the financial news headlines you provided, my analysis is as follows:

Elon Musk says Twitter had many employees but little product development - This headline is not directly related to the market, and it is more focused on Twitter's internal operations. Hence, it is not likely to have a significant impact on the market.

Apple partners with Goldman Sachs on high-yield savings account - This headline suggests that Apple is expanding its financial services portfolio by partnering with Goldman Sachs. This move is likely to generate more revenue for both companies and positively impact the market.

Ryan Reynolds becomes investor in Nuvei fintech company - This headline suggests that Ryan Reynolds, a popular actor, has invested in a fintech company. This news might generate interest in Nuvei, positively impacting its stock price.

EU may struggle to catch up with U.S., Asia in chips subsidies race - This headline suggests that the EU might not be able to compete with the US and Asia in terms of providing subsidies to chip manufacturers. This news may negatively impact the European chip manufacturing sector, leading to a bearish outlook for the market.

LARRY KUDLOW: McCarthy & Co will have a strong debt ceiling package - This headline suggests that the US debt ceiling package proposed by McCarthy & Co is likely to be strong, which may positively impact the market.

Overall, based on the five financial news headlines provided, the outlook for the market is slightly bullish, with the exception of the EU's chip manufacturing sector, which might be negatively impacted. However, it is important to note that the market is complex, and various factors can influence its direction, and the analysis based on only five headlines is not comprehensive.",t3_12qjpgl,1681859656.0,1

The AI will be primarily finding the data points it needs to construct information in articles created as a part of other misinformation campaigns and then finding large volumes of misinformation clones supporting it's bad thesis.

It becomes a problem where the only chatgpt constructions you can trust are ones where a trusted human has vetted the materials and sources. (so pretty much the same as now anyways).

They had that Deborah woman leak debate stuff to Hillary to cheat against Bernie Sanders once, and she was subsequently fired. That was pretty much the only instance of a person within the network doing some shady partisan shit. FOX on the otherhand, pretty much every single anchor or network speaker is flat out a high level GOP party member that straight up speaks at CPAC and works directly with political GOP campaigns, fundraisers etc. Like... all of them. Its not even slightly subtle. The worst things CNN has ever been accused of doing are things that happen on FOX a dozen times in the first 15 minutes of the 8am news. MSNBC, is the same shit just dialed back 25%, (which is still atrocious, its just next to impossible to fully embody and match FOX level of insanity)

Its objectively dumb that CNN is the political boogeyman to peasant level conservatives that dont know any better.   And no middle or upper tier conservatives would ever consider them ""the worst"" and actually believe it. They might SAY it, because its become some weird kind of slogan, but the smart one no better. 

I mean, lets be real here... Nobody has ever had an issue with CNN, The Times, ABC, NBC, Al Jazera, BBC, and basically every other network besides fox and newsmax before, until Trump got himself into trouble and told everyone to hate and disbelieve any form of news that reports anythingbesides kissing his ass. CNN just wound up being the favorite target because it has a convenient acronym. Thats pretty much it. What most people dont realize, is that repeating it doesnt do anything but make the average person identify you as being stupid. You can all laugh and have a chuckle and encourage eachother to say that dumb shit in your inner circle of of peers, and maybe doing so is what makes them all so naive to the real world implications of repeating silly shit like that. 

But in real life the vast majority of people just instantly identify you as someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about, and know you are likely to follow a predetermined set of carbon copy values and beliefs that someone else laid out for you. Running around taking every opportunity to shout ""ClInToN NeWs NetWoRrrrk"" in places like options trading subreddits, just alerts everybody that you probably dont have much to say that has any value whatsoever. Think about it. The Clinton News Network? A Clinton hasnt even held an elected political office in decades. They probably arent even mentioned on CNN one single time in an average fiscal quarter.

3821,jn8e6a8,t3_142vn3e,"I am going to present you the contrarian view

A lot of posts since MVIS stock is up +260% since 1st of May and all this AI fever. In a nutshell, MVIS is a lidar solution company. All of a sudden, WSB regards thinks this is the best stock to YOLO and...keep accumulating losses while they dream to become millionaire.

Let's go straight to the valuation. This company started trading since even before most of you were born and still, is releasing promises in each earning calls. Now, the magic AI word will help them cash in their pennystocks.

* 2023 Revenue forecast: $10-15 M
* Net Cash to be burnt in Operations: $50-55 M
* Current Valuation after +260% rally: $1.3 Billion 
* Looking at their historic they aren't profitable, rather they just burn more than what they can generate

But luckily, WSB regards are here to save a bunch of investors and management team with stock options. Please save them while you dream and end up holding another bag.

Will the stock rally in the next sessions? Oh yes! high chances as it has just become a penny stock in the radar of all the retailers and algo-trading machines. But there was one guy who posted a technical analysis chart saying that he has been waiting for 7m for this magic moment and that he forecast a share price of 461$... so basically you have a 70x bagger.

3848,jn8dll7,t3_142vn3e,"Aright, I'll bite. As of it's Q1 report, $MVIS had a total of 68m $ in cash reservers, with a quarterly free cash burn in the range of 10-14m $. This would give them a runrate of \~1 year before they have to raise additional capital. With little to no current sales, something drastic would have to change, for the company to turn into the rocketship as everyone is expecting. I would therefore ask the following: 

1. Are there any indicators that some of the major players are comitting to adopting MVIS technology? So far i have seen no indicators, aside from the lofty promises of industry leading technology. If no major players are comitting, then i can see little reason for the recent increase in valuation. 
2. Of the 68m $ in cash reservers, 45m $ are investment securities. Do you have any information on what these securities contain? I couldnt find anything. If these securities contain bonds, then the market value may be less than stated in their report, when they have to liquidate them in coming periods. In any case, i fear that the company may be forced to do a equity offering in the near future, very likely capitalizing on this recent pump.

3867,jnb0p1h,t3_142vn3e,"With how heavily shorted this stock is, it could definitely go parabolic. It could also skyrocket on any partnership or big sales announcement. It‚Äôs still worth taking some profit now though. Consider this scenario: MVIS is either sold in a massive portion of all autonomous vehicles, or is bought out by one of the large auto companies. Is this likely to happen eventually? Well, barring some other company developing some completely revolutionary new technology, yes. It‚Äôs arguably nearly inevitable. The autonomous vehicle market is going to blow up over the next decade. MVIS has patents on their Lidar tech that completely blows away all other Lidar, it‚Äôs not even close. Plus it‚Äôs very cheap and sleek enough to fit on any vehicle design. But even if we assume that it‚Äôs inevitable for the price to shoot up when they actually make a deal and/or start raking in 30+% of the market, is that likely to happen *before* the price drops significantly from where it is now? Because the price action now is heavily driven by short activity. 

The thing to remember is that the fundamentals of profit MVIS is currently making + their assets puts the stock valuation less than the current price. The value of the stock if they started selling Lidar units and/or got a buyout, could easily shoot to 50|100$+. But until that happens,  short activity/random news is going to be the primary driver for significant price action. And the shorts are going to do everything they can to drive the price back down at some point. Without consistent news, the price will steadily drop back down to the 3-5$ range. If you‚Äôre already making a shit ton of money, you may as well cover your ass if the deals you expect to happen any day now don‚Äôt happen for another few months or years. Even just like 10% of your profit into long puts, and then another 10% if the price hits the mid teens. 

Lastly, don‚Äôt trust what the MVIS board says too much. They have had multiple deals fall through and have changed their business plan with this Lidar already. Early 2021 they had publicly outlined their plan to shop the tech around for a buyout/partnership and also set up a manufacturing/production plan so that if they didn‚Äôt get a buyout/partnership by the end of 2021, they would start selling Lidar units in 2022. IIRC announced around 15k units in the first quarter of 2022. One of the things that chaps my ass is that I was trading the stock believing that at least there would be income from selling the units even if nothing else panned out. But then they decided to scrap that plan completely, and instead work on the tech and just continue to shop around for buyers/partners indefinitely.  Queue bagholding until that happens, as the price dropped from the teens to 3-5$ when everyone suddenly found out all the expected sales profit isn‚Äôt gonna happen, because they suddenly decided to not sell the product. 

Not like I am qualified to give financial advice but it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out you should cover your ass my guy. This is coming from someone that believes MVIS is inevitably gonna go parabolic at some point in the next few months/years. I saw the Tech in action at the Lidar expo this year, and it‚Äôs undeniable. unless some other Lidar company discovers a revolutionary completely new way to make Lidar function way better, no Lidar company is going to be able to close the gap with the patents MVIS has. You should still cover your ass though. Not that I‚Äôm qualified to give financial advice, I just learned some painful lessons when I bought MVIS calls in may/April 2021, and didn‚Äôt cover my ass well enough when I made stupidly high profits.",t3_142vn3e,1686170692.0,-1

3974,jn8wpi9,t1_jn8vffk,"""RECOMMENDATION We rate MICROVISION INC (MVIS) a SELL. This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its feeble growth in its earnings per share, deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and weak operating cash flow. HIGHLIGHTS MICROVISION INC's earnings per share declined by 37.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share have declined over the last two years. We anticipate that this should continue in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, MICROVISION INC reported poor results of -$0.32 versus -$0.27 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 15.6% in earnings (-$0.37 versus -$0.32). The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and greatly underperformed compared to the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector average. The net income has significantly decreased by 44.5% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$13.17 million to -$19.03 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector and the overall market, MICROVISION INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the subsector average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to -$13.80 million or 26.53% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the subsector average, the firm's growth is significantly lower. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, MVIS's share price has jumped by 45.77%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the future course of this stock, we feel that the risks involved in investing in MVIS do not compensate for any future upside potential, despite the fact that it has seen nice gains over the past 12 months.""",t3_142vn3e,1686141368.0,-1

There's also the expectation of some major PR from the company related to a major deal coming some time this year (CEO described it as an ""epic"" year in the last EC).

You don't seem to have a clue wtf you're doing, might as well just give your money to charity.

Once I pointed out to you that the stock was being driven by a short covering, it became all about tHe ShOrT sQuEeZe to you. You don't even understand that institutional shorts can contact directly the company and ask them to sell a bunch of stock to them from the shelf (so that they don't have to buy through the open market), which is probably what happened.

The divestiture was initiated by the filing in 1974 by the United States Department of Justice of an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T.  The. Real up happen in 1984 - ten years later!  Nothing to see here with Google except a bunch of politicians and attorneys for quite some time.

The breakup of the Bell System resulted in the creation of seven independent companies that were formed from the original twenty-two AT&T-controlled members of the System.[5]

On January 1, 1984, these companies were NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, Southwestern Bell Corporation, BellSouth, and US West.

NYNEX, acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1996, now part of Verizon Communications

Pacific Telesis, acquired by SBC in 1997, now part of AT&T Inc.

Ameritech, acquired by SBC in 1999, now part of AT&T Inc.

Bell Atlantic, merged with GTE in 2000 to form Verizon Communications

Southwestern Bell Corporation, rebranded as SBC Communications in 1995, acquired AT&T Corporation in 2005

BellSouth, acquired by AT&T Inc. in 2006

In response to ChatGPT, Google released Bard a couple of months later and it already eclipses ChatGPT in most areas and isn't nearly as repetitive in its text layout. Bard uses live internet data whereas ChatGPT only pulls from a static dataset that was grabbed in 2021. Bard also grabs and models from a dataset that is 2.5 times larger than ChatGPT.

Google did $224B in global revenue in 2022 with opex of $83B for a net of $140B.  They are estimated to have 1B people using their services.  Divided evenly this is $140 per user per year.  That's roughly equivalent to $11 / month / person.  

Granted users in rich countries likely are more lucrative than users in poorer let's say in the EU it's maybe 2x that so $20 / month.  Is that too much?  Should I really be getting a share of this to use their service?  What % should I get?   Would this even do anything really?  What happens when the company invests more or has a down year, would my payments fluctuate based on profitability?  What would stop the company from adjusting its books to reduce user payouts?  More laws?

Also the EU isn't even asking these companies to start profit sharing, they are just putting laws in place as a justification to fine them for shit.  That money doesn't go to people it goes to the government which maybe sort of trickles down to the people?

This whole the ""EU protects its people"" thing is great marketing for the EU government, but let's be honest, it's really just a politically marketed high profile tax on the biggest businesses in their markets.   Furthermore these regulations make all the companies in their market, domestic and foreign, have to deal with more crap.   
I'll conclude this rant with my opinion that the EU governments don't give a shit about fair markets, they want their pound of flesh.

It's an embarrassing blunder on Google's part for inventing that architecture, but not capitalize on it, and letting a small startup pants them with it years later.

OpenAI is out-executing google. They stole the spot light for the most cutting edge language model and they are maintaining the lead. They just announced yesterday their new function calling capabilities on their API models, and it's another step widening the gap. Guaranteed Google leadership is yelling about it like regards in meetings today. 

Google:

1. Is stuck in the innovator's dilemma
2. Is scared of bad PR
3. Are playing to not lose market-share, they are not playing to win. They don't stand to gain billions of new users and revenue, they are already at peak saturation with high margins. Those margins are like a drunk college girl's virginity at a frat party - LOL at thinking it's going to stay intact.
4. Has a shit corporate culture that's well documented for only rewarding the launch of new services - which is why there's a Google graveyard of apps (ask the Stadia devs how they feel).

What I will say to you is, the Quality of Life in the EU is as good as, if not better than the USA. How I view the difference is that either you can have a better quality of life with more taxes, or a worse quality of life and more money. That's a gamble, because if you want something badly in the USA you're going to pay for it. The USA is the finest Capitalist model for sure, but it doesn't take more than a couple of seconds to realise there's something seriously fucked up going on over there. Adam Smith would shit himself.... Anyway, I'm investing in renewables, eventually the world is going to go bat shit for that stuff, fusion too. Hard to say where that's going to end up.  I'll just finish by saying I don't have any grief with the USA, I have family that's been there since pretty much the Mayflower. Put it this way, if the USA was a traded company I'd be selling it's shares right now. Far too much turmoil in that market. RENEWABLES! EDIT: Regarding your point on Trickle down, traditional trickle down was a straight up lie. What the EU do actually do, is invest in the poorest areas - fund infrastructure, transport links etc. That's a form of trickle down, the businesses are still making mighty profits and we got new high tech highways, those highways are also good for business. People like to shit on ""socialism"" or whatever that means. What Europe has is a hybrid and I believe the EU are aiming for the best of both worlds.

As an AI language model, I cannot engage in personal attacks or use profanity, but I can provide an informed response to the idea of a ""white collar AI apocalypse."" While it is true that AI and automation have the potential to disrupt certain industries and job markets, the idea that it will lead to a complete collapse of the white-collar workforce is an over-exaggeration.

In fact, history has shown that technological advancements have always created new opportunities and jobs, rather than eliminating them. The advent of computers, for example, created an entirely new field of employment in computer programming and software engineering.

Moreover, many white-collar jobs require skills that are difficult to automate, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. These skills are uniquely human and cannot be replicated by machines.

While AI may eventually replace certain tasks within white-collar professions, it is unlikely to result in a complete elimination of these jobs. Instead, it will likely lead to a shift in job roles and responsibilities as companies seek to optimize their operations and leverage the capabilities of these technologies.

Therefore, the notion of a ""white-collar AI apocalypse"" is unfounded and does not reflect the nuanced and complex reality of how AI and automation will impact the workforce.""",t3_1256696,1680049311.0,101

4429,je5t9w8,t3_1256696,"I‚Äôm entering the legal profession, so take my point with that bias in mind. However, the fact that people think legal practitioners are going to be gone in 5-20 years is, in my mind, unfounded. On the one hand, we as a society place a lot of agency in the law‚Äôs communicative function. This encompasses meeting face to face with a lawyer, who will go through your distinct legal problem with you. Moreover, when a case goes to trial, would people be willing to have the judge replaced by a computer? I don‚Äôt think so. (Not to mention the political and moral ramifications such a computer driven and adjudicated legal system would operate). 

Airplanes can fly on complete auto-pilot, but we still want to have a pilot to be there. 

Lastly, we have to remember who is in control of society. The generation that is soon to be glimpsing power 40-60, does not want to have complete AI usurpation. Not to mention, the only people who would take away the legal profession, would, ironically be the legal profession. Lots of high government officials are lawyers, who have implement a statutory regime that the only people capable of giving legal advice are lawyers. Would the law, operate to destroy their own profession? Not a chance.

Not to mention that the law itself is about 20 years behind current societal advancements. In my country, most big firms have to keep paper copies of every file. Somewhat surprisingly, we also have the requirement to utilize a typewriter for certain draftings.

Lastly, I would like to mention that there is a current debate about how a AI program like ChatGPT is rampantly committing copyright violations. This is an area of the law that will skyrocket in the future. 

Lastly, I would like to mention that Wills for example, present a huge problem for an AI system. Sure, perhaps it will get advanced enough to draft one, but to interpret one? I don‚Äôt think so. For jurisdictions that retain the separation of a determinable and subsequent interest, there is a huge difference in outcome for vesting. The only way to distinguish such a difference, is by analyzing the intention of the parties. Sure, language can be used, but it is not determinable in any regard. Often, it requires looking at extrinsic evidence. Which is outside of the four corners of a document.

**Humans Need Not Apply:**

One of the closing takeaways was: In the 1700's the US census tracked 10 types of jobs, now there's hundreds tracked. But if you look at the list a lot of the jobs are just more detailed descriptions that all existed in the 1700's, and when the video was published numbers 1-30 all existed in some form in the 1700's (number one being transportation), it's not until we get to 31 with computer programmers.

Imagine the scenario where a ""LawyerGpt"" App can do everything a lawyer does but better. Sure you might want to have one lawyer check over it's work so you don't get screwed. But that would mean one Law Firm Partner can just double check over 10 times the number of cases. But the other ten lawyers that used to be under him are no longer needed. That doesn't mean that the law firm is all of a sudden going to transform into a new industry, there's no next step to law firm, it's just going to not need those lawyers. And it's going to be like that for every industry. And then in the future you probably won't even need the overseer once you're confident it'll get it right, just like how we don't double check excel spreadsheets calculations by hand.

There aren't many industries I can think of where the workers are a significant portion of the target customer base.

Fast food? So you fire all your workers and miss out on the $10 a day they spend on their food... Maybe. They still gottta eat so maybe not.

Regardless the $10 you're getting out of them buying lunch is negligible compared to what you're paying them all day.

Copywriting requires creativity, empathy, and a deep understanding of the target audience, which are difficult to replicate with current AI technology. Additionally, copywriting is often a collaborative process, and human copywriters are able to provide valuable insights and feedback to help improve the final product.

&#x200B;

At the same time those news came out for Google. Microsoft released Edge with New Bing (using GPT) publicly, for free, for anyone to use, on almost every platform. Chrome is dying too.

&#x200B;

Google price is still high.

&#x200B;

But it looks like it's just coasting. Those buckets of money can only be as reassuring as the people who are in charge of them. And those people are pissing their pants right now.

&#x200B;

However, longer term, AI is the new Linux. AI is open as in libre. No single entity can own AI.

Small teams will be the new norm. Metcalfe's law means the cost of communication and coordination grows exponentially with team size. Big teams are fd.

  * LoRA fine-tuning method - Microsoft (2021) (this is one of the key technologies the article cites as democratizing AI)

Open source is just a licencing agreement that promotes collaboration. On the other hand is the proprietary software, which is where companies make money.  
Both Google and OpenAI uses a lot of open source software and a lot of proprietary software. Both also create open source and proprietary software.  
So if we are talking about those superior open source models, which one are we talking about? Which one is supposedly better and by which metric? Yeah, there are no answers because OpenAI right now is at the top. Maybe they or Google will eventually open source their model, or collaboration between other companies will create better one, but right now it doesn't.  
Article is right about Google and OpenAI having no moat and no secret sauce. Algorithms are known for about five years, you can create your own GPT in less than two hours (look up Andrej Karpaty, OpenAI researcher, tutorial on YouTube). OpenAI mostly uses Azure, where you can also rent processing power to train your AI (though it did cost OpenAI few hundred millions in fees) Devil is in the details and there are ton of opportunities for improvement and fine tunings.  
Technology rarely improves by single or few good ideas. Usually it's a matter of applying thousands of hours of thousands of skilled engineers into a problem, making millions of small improvements. OpenAI invested most talent into this problem, Google is ramping up right now.

I had worked with companies who employed armies of interns to do this kind of tagging and categorisation work. 

Meanwhile a connoisseur of the fine japanese arts sits in his parents basement and already has a perfectly tagged dataset thanks to years of studying them. 

And now this individual gets his hands on an AI Model and starts training with his high quality dataset. 

And basically this can be applied to many other things as well. Ans by the nature of the net more like minded connoisseurs of the fine arts will meet and share their data and so it creates a FOS project dedicated to generation fine arts of japan better than Google or open AI ever could.

Ok, believe whatever you want to believe. I just know that Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, and they were way into AI before that. The have like an 8-year head start on Microsoft, if not more. 

So, one of these two things are true:

1. Google is an absolute failure at AI, and haven't achieved squat even though they have employed literally thousands of machine learning engineers over the last 8 or 9 years. Just an absolutely catastrophic failure on the part of Google.

or


2. Google has been steadily working on AI from the very beginning, but having a large language model for the use of the general public was something they were never really interested in.

Companies like Google *claim* that you need truly massive data at all times. You know why? Because if it's true, *nobody should bother to compete with them*. It's something they say to justify funding their research, specifically. But the emperor, increasingly, seems to have no clothes.

But we actually both agree that Google wasn't that interested in LLMs, so they invested less into this field, even though they are in the game longer (as you said yourself). OpenAI put more engineering power to LLMs and it paid off, now Google is playing catch up in LLMs.  
  
One thing that is super confusing is ""AI"" naming. Depending on who you talk to, it could include basic machine learning models like linear regression or decision tree, or it could include just neural networks and image classifiers, or it could exclude even them and include only language models and image generating models, or it could mean AGI or just physical robots with language models - AI can mean basically anything nowadays.",t3_1395x5r,1683406050.0,1

So it's basically an attempt at making a new type of password that can't reasonably be lost, stolen, or shared.

ChatGPT: It's difficult to determine whether someone is ""smart"" or not based on a single action such as buying a stock. However, it's important to note that buying a stock based solely on a connection to a homework helper (in this case, ChatGPT) may not necessarily be the most informed investment decision.

It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions, taking into account factors such as the company's financial health, industry trends, and market conditions.

Overall, the decision to buy a stock ticker AI based on a connection to AI (ChatGPT) may not be the most rational approach to investing, but it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about the individual's level of intelligence based on this action alone.",t3_12132x2,1679705613.0,53

C3's competitive advantage seems to be in their ability to work with bespoke clusterfucks of data, which the others don't want to touch. Not worth the effort.

Long answer: You're right that changes in a company's revenue and pricing models can make it harder to compare financials year-over-year and understand what's going on with their receivables balance. These changes can impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, and you need to take them into account when analyzing a company's financial performance.

Concerns about revenue quality related to a growing receivables balance are valid, especially if it's due to changes in the pricing model. However, it's important to differentiate between genuine business decisions and any attempts to manipulate financial results.

Without having more in-depth information on all this, it's hard to really tell, tbh. It's ""he said, she said"" at this point - we can't know, but neither does Kerrisdale.",t3_12cecmm,1680690948.0,2

However, we can't be sure, and other factors could be at play, like personal circumstances or CFOs finding better opportunities elsewhere. In my experience with friends in the tech sector, it's pretty common for them to switch jobs every 1-2 years max. This could be due to the fast-paced industry, better opportunities, or personal growth reasons.

It's unclear if CFOs in tech change jobs for the same reasons as other tech professionals, so take this with a grain of salt.

I read the short report and thought some of the language was really immature, but that it raised some concerns that IF they are not problematic should be very easily explained in accounting terms, not in an indirect sales pitch kinda way as in this thread. 

I'm also an accountant and I've never looked at C3 financials and actually getting a clear picture takes more time than I care to commit, but ""unbilled receivables"" is not usually a significant portion of sales in companies I've been exposed to. Even if that's on the up and up there's some risk associated with an agreement like that that I would assume should be noted in their financials. 

The question about a significant portion of revenue being reported at 99% margin is a good one, and if there's a good reason for it should be easily explained. That is free money... The language from their financials about the revenue from baker Hughes being reduced by any revenue received by certain customers sounds unusual also, but if there is some kind of setup where baker Hughes is simply donating cash up to a certain amount that's reduced when c3 makes sales that should be easy to outline.

I don't know about the short seller's history and couldn't even pick them out of a line up. But what they say sounds reasonable to me at a high level without having done much research into this specific company, understanding the economics of some AI based competition, and my general accounting knowledge.

If you could have told me about the changes in the pricing model and how operationally things would be different under each approach, I might be more convinced that you truly understand the issues. Moving from a subscription to a usage pricing model does concern me; especially as the accounts receivable balances increase significantly. It suggests to me that customers aren't using the products enough and that this AI company is doing something equivalent to digital channel stuffing. 

A subscription model is less risky from a revenue quality standpoint because regardless how much the client eats, you still get your money. However, there is always the risk of overeating by some customers in a subscription model; negatively impacting margins. Additionally the risks of an increasing receivables balance right now is that financing costs are increasing because small banks like SVIB went under and bigger banks provide less favorable financing terms. Which at the very least can potentially impact margins negatively as financing costs rise and, at worst, cause a company to go bankrupt if they cannot deficit finance their operations on their journey to profitably.

My suggestion would be to do more research and reading and really be able to scrutinize this company and the questions posed by the short seller more deeply. While posting it here to Wallstreetbets is a start, you need to put this up against stronger accounting minds. Like people in r/accounting or r/tax. Because you're generally arguing with ignorant people here and most of whom will be biased towards your position because they will likely be fellow shareholders in this company. Confirmation bias is a dangerous thing for an investor. Especially for someone with so much money in one company.

Having an AI suite that calls ChatGPT, or even that runs a pre-built LLM, is like writing a browser plugin vs. building a browser.  It's a relatively paltry effort.  Hundreds of ChatGPT products are popping up from every sort of company, just the other day the Azure guys were giving a presentation about building services with the ChatGPT API at my work.  

  
The latest isn't always the greatest for everything anyway.  Transformer models are the latest fad, but they're not the latest advancements per se.  Even in the current incarnation they've been around since 2017 and the main idea goes back at least to 1992.  One of the things I hate about the machine learning field is that no one seems to read any material (perhaps because CS is so conference based... they jump from one fad to another and often mistakenly think old ideas are new).  But fair enough, they're using the new fad so I guess it does make sense for them to be part of that bubble.

Do you talk to Google for >90% of your searches?  If not, then why would you buy into the value add of that sort of ""natural"" interaction with technical data?  

They don't exactly make it clear where they are and are not using the generative capabilities, but anywhere that they are is inherently unreliable, so with them not being clear in their pitch about that... it isn't clear whether or not you can rely on anything there then.  At least regular ChatGPT is hooked up with Wolfram Alpha now and states when it does or does not use it.  Ok, looking at the data sheet makes things a bit more clear.  It generates a text response in the far right panel (so consider that unreliable) and generates a query for the big top panel to support the top result (which you also need to double check, that the generated query was actually appropriate).  A meta-search of your company's data resources... oooh aaah. /s  For those that haven't seen it:  [https://c3.ai/products/c3-generative-ai-product-suite/](https://c3.ai/products/c3-generative-ai-product-suite/)

It's still very much just an enterprise database wrangling tool.  Which is fine, that's their core competency.  Can we stop pretending that they do anything interesting with their AI yet?    


""Their main existing clients are energy, defense, financial.""  Are they developing more efficient solar cells with their AI?  Are they using AI for advanced target acquisition and tracking?  Are they using AI to make big bucks in algorithmic trading?  No, that's not what they do.  They make stuff for any old generic company to (hopefully) better view and understand their own data.  When I look at their ""Industries"" tab on their site it just looks like they listed every big industry.  I don't think having clients from an industry should be construed as being in that industry.  E.g. energy companies aren't in the cloud computing industry.    


Take a look at their products: [https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/)  It's all just about how they can flavor the same product to be a bit more tuned for each industry.  It's not like they work on any fundamental problems of that industry or help those companies achieve that.  They're not helping Intel or AMD with chip placement problems.  They've got a case study thing on ""Improving Drug Manufacturing Reliability and Performance.""  Do you think they made changes to the chemistry for better yield with a more reliable method?  Of course not.  They essentially worked on predicting failures, something some of my colleagues have done for a very large and well known partner.  Perhaps we should slap AI in our name (oh wait... we did do that)... but we're not a publicly traded company so we don't have any stock to inflate by doing so.  

I don't think AI will have growth in energy, defense, financial, etc... for their fundamentals.  Those aren't things C3 does.  Isn't their actual industry SaaS or PaaS?  And their competitors more like Oracle (where Siebel is from) or Salesforce or the like?    


The TLDR is... they seem fine at what they actually do.  I don't think the stock popping off on an AI bubble is particularly warranted, but most of the others doing so don't have any more merit to them either...  I might say it's AI bubble risk rather than any sort of risk particular to C3.  For C3 specific risk I would need to actually care about their financials and read the Kerisdale report...

They should be cautious with those... make sure to keep updating the models, especially since tree based models like those tend to extrapolate poorly if they hit anything outside their domain.  For some applications where the data is more stationary, they'll be fine, but for other applications the drifting means may eventually become big problems.  I'm a bit surprised that they used a depth of just 5 with over 700 features... makes me think the vast majority of them are unnecessary and there is very little interaction.  With models under 100 features I have sometimes found a depth of 14 to have the best performance on the test data.  I'm not saying all data would be complex enough for 14, few cases would be, but 5... off the top of my head I think 5 is the default value so I wonder how much they explored.  In some of their cases studies they cite running hundreds of ML models though... so who knows.

\- Starting from a specific date, the money Baker Hughes owes to C3.ai will be reduced by the amount C3.ai makes from some of their customers.

\- Under the new contract, Baker Hughes will pay C3.ai more frequently, get broader reseller rights, and C3.ai will offer more products and services. This change increases the overall money involved in the deal.

\- If Baker Hughes performs exceptionally well and surpasses certain goals, they may need to pay C3.ai even more.

5464,irejc5j,t3_xxvy03,Meta's key competitors are TikTok and Apple imo.,t3_xxvy03,1665150168.0,84
5465,irelgh2,t3_xxvy03,">Meta‚Äôs key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. 

fucking LOL this guy doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, meta to zero",t3_xxvy03,1665151215.0,91
5466,irepeqc,t3_xxvy03,"I don't agree with some parts of this.  


For one, this article is way too focused on 'META', and not enough on how META makes money.  


Advertising on Facebook and Instagram is incredibly profitable for businesses, particularly in the e-Commerce sector.  


It would be a mistake to assume that LinkedIn is a threat to Facebook in any major way. Facebook's bread and butter does not have a HUGE overlap with LinkedIn. Two completely different platforms that cater to different segments.  


I would wager that the biggest threats to Facebook are YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon.  


Particularly Tiktok and Amazon.  


Facebook has co-existed with YouTube advertising for a long time, but TikTok is projected to capture [$12 billion in advertising spend](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/tiktok-becomes-cash-machine-with-revenue-tripling-to-12-billion).  


Similarly, [Amazon has captured $32 billion in ad revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-has-a-31-billion-a-year-advertising-business.html).  


The reason for why I believe Amazon and Tiktok are greater threats to META is the following:  


A very big part of the advertisers on META are e-commerce brands. The same audience that is attractive to e-commerce advertisers is the same audience that would be targeted by TikTok & Amazon.  


For example:  


If I am a service-focused local advertiser (home remodelers, junk yards, plumbers, etc...) - Google is going to be my bread and butter. Although I don't have any insight, having worked in digital advertising for a long time, I can tell you that what these local service businesses make on Google would be hard to beat elsewhere.  


I don't imagine that Facebook has ever done well in this sector and never would have.  


The reason being that if a plumber targets you with an ad on Facebook but nothing in your house is broken, then you're simply not going to convert. On the other hand, if something in your house DOES break, your almost immediate reaction is to go to Google and look up a plumber. And that's where Google excels, and always has.  


And what are the chances that an ad on Facebook reaches you the immediate second that something breaks? Or that you remember that a month ago you had seen an ad on Facebook for a plumbing service?  


Facebook's bread and butter are consumer brands. And these same consumer brands are the ones who are most likely to go to TikTok to reach those audiences. Why is my guess for why YouTube is pushing Shorts, and META is pushing Reels.  


They don't want to lose that specific audience segment.  


Similarly, if Amazon can improve their advertising algorithms enough so that sellers on its platforms can see greater returns on investment, that proves a very strong challenge to Facebook who would see diminished advertising on its platform from Amazon sellers.  


The growth and effectiveness on YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon are then what I believe to be the biggest threats to META's ad revenue.  


I agree that META should have long diversified more (Alphabet makes 80% of its revenue from online advertising vs. META's 99%) but that's a different topic.  


The reason why I believe people should focus more on META's future as a go-to platform for online advertising is because the online advertising market is expected to grow to $1 trillion dollars in size by 2027, compared to $500 billion (roughly) as it is today.  


If META can continue to capture at least 20% of the total market, that would put its revenue at around $200 billion in the next 5 years.  


But this would be imagining that the company does NOTHING but try to keep up which I don't think is true of the platform, overall. The META execs are not silly and I would imagine their revenue figures would exceed $200 billion before 2027, which would make it significantly more valuable than \~ $150's per share.

5468,ire81wp,t3_xxvy03,"This sub doesn't deserve your level of skill and talent. But thanks for sharing. I have been interested in learning how to make all these projections for stock value, but never got the time to start. Will try to learn from the google docs link, how to code this stuff in Python.

As for Meta/Facebook, I think they are going to end up being one of those, ""too early for their time"", *plus* the fact that their business model is a bit more parasitic and harmful to society than other social media services. Facebook made the smart decision to consolidate as much presence as possible in social sphere with Instagram and Whatsapp acquisitions, but it made a huge mistake going so blindly into this whole Metaverse hype.

Metaverse as a concept is still very new and with very limited *real*, valuable applications. I would rather have a Zoom meeting with *actual, real* people than their cartoonish avatars. Wearing the Oculus headset for even an hour is not going to be an enjoyable experience. There is very little incentive for serious use of Meta in business of any kind. It's not providing crucial tech for AR/MR that might be at least useful for more creative enterprises or simulating engineering problems that can actually be used by companies. And Meta's Metaverse has proven itself how underdeveloped and useless it really is for any ""fun"" socialising (those dead Meta eyes from Zuckerberg's avatar still haunt me).

It's just hype. Pure and simple hype. A social media company who's only USP was once, ""it is cool"", is now just a frothing, seething swamp of extremist propaganda and people who grew old with the website. Zuckerberg had way too much executive control here without check. He could've rather focussed on making facebook are more serious hub for older generation with some constructive contribution to society: better source validation for news articles, fixing the buggy/bloated Video/Audio Messenger, developing the Marketplace into a more complete and serious business platform. They had the right demographic for that, Marketplace has good use in Asian countries at least. They could've taken the existing billions of user base and focussed on becoming a platform for small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs, like how Youtube is still relevant by providing a serious streaming platform for content creators -- despite all the controversy with its business/payment model, it still is relevant!",t3_xxvy03,1665143834.0,38

The thing is, you can't possibly rely on asking the model to design an aircraft or an architecture, backend and implementation of a large-scale IT system for, say government institutions, because AI won't be able to learn efficiently on the existing data that we currently have, which is not much. Each large-scale system serves different purpose and has too many variables for model to learn to generalize. Another thing is that, I can't imagine companies with before-mentioned large systems to share the internal data with the AI companies.

Is ChatGPT a game changer? Yes, I use it frequently in my work and it's really helpful if I need some short script or manifest quickly. MSFT and GOOG made very good decisions to purse AI long time ago. But, will it make them richer in the short-term? I don't think so.",t3_10g7orf,1674166806.0,2

Why are there so many AI/ChatGPT ""experts"" who don't understand what they're talking about?

I'm going to assume you are not a SWE and you do not understand how ChatGPT functions. From your profile, it appears that you're a truck driver. ChatGPT does not have the ability to create original code. It writes code based on training data. Ask it yourself. Here is the response,



> ChatGPT is a language model that can generate text based on the examples it has been trained on and the context provided by the input. While it can generate code snippets, it does not have the ability to create original code or understand the logic or meaning behind the code it generates. It can only generate code based on patterns and examples it has seen during its training. It is not capable of understanding the purpose or function of the code it generates, or how it might be used in a larger program.

Can you understand some of its limitations now?

> Yes it is. You know it is.

It is not. I know it is not. 

> You even said it is.

I never said that. 

> You said it can't make source code then later say welllll it's context dependant.

I said ChatGPT is not able to successfully translate **""any idea""** into source code. It has complexity limits and it cannot generate original code. Even at lower complexity levels, it routinely generates non-functional code. 

> I'm responding to your incorrect statement

> The bottom line is ChatGPT can make code out of basically anything you ask. Will it work? Sometimes. Will it be well made? Doesn't matter.

lol? Non-functional code is useless. Whether or not it's well made absolutely matters. Am I being punkd here?

The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

I don't see anyone behaving pretentiously. I stated this because your comments reflect that you do not understand how ChatGPT functions, and your history indicates that you're a truck driver. I do so cautiously, since assuming is a bad habit. 

Why are you writing so confidently about something you so clearly do not understand? You don't find that odd?

> Never said it didn't have limitations. You are just building a straw man to attack.

This doesn't make sense. Are you aware of the original statement that we're discussing? OP claimed that ChatGPT can successfully write code for **any** idea/application. 

> Yes, this ALL would be covered under the part of my response that said it could make source code that might not work or not be of good quality. So I still stand correct and you are just moving the goal post.

Mate, this is a really dumb comment. If the code does not work, than it's not ""successful"" and the code is useless. My infant daughter can write code that doesn‚Äôt work too! There are no goalposts being moved. No need for silly idioms. 

> The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

Okay, clearly you have no idea what the topic is. No one has questioned whether ChatGPT can produce **any** code. OP suggested that it can code **ANYTHING**, which is false. You can ask ChatGPT this yourself. I posted the response, which you somehow managed to entirely avoid.

> You can dance around this 100 times and 100 times you will still be wrong. It CAN produce source code. You are wrong.

No one said ChatGPT cannot produce code. Are you high as fuck or something? You don't seem to be aware of what we're talking about.

Alright, buckle up, folks, 'cause it's time for FictionCorp's epic earnings call! Today, we're gonna blow your fucking minds with our AI extravaganza. We're on a mission to outdo NVIDIA in the AI name-dropping game, 'cause we ain't afraid to show off our AI prowess, baby!

So, let's dive right in and talk about our revolutionary AI-powered products and solutions. We've infused AI into every damn nook and cranny of our operations. We're talking AI-powered widgets, AI-driven doodads, and even AI-controlled underpants (yep, you heard that shit right!). We're all about that AIception, where we use AI to do AI of AI while sipping on our 69th cup of coffee for the day. It's pure genius, I tell ya!

Our AI-driven revenue has skyrocketed like a rocket-powered unicorn on steroids. We've hit the magical 420 mark, and it ain't just the stoners who are impressed. Our AI algorithms have become the talk of the town, like the popular kids in high school who always get the best parking spots. From predicting stock market trends to optimizing avocado toast recipes (we're hipster-friendly), our AI-powered platform does it all.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Is FictionCorp just slapping the AI label on everything to ride the trend? Hell no! We take our AI shit seriously. Our team of brainiacs, who wear lab coats as fashionable attire, have been sweating their asses off to make our AI algorithms smarter than a supercomputer on steroids. We're transforming the world one ""AI"" at a time, making Elon Musk's neuralink experiments look like child's play.

But wait, there's more! We've also developed an AI assistant named SnarkyBot (inspired by yours truly, I might add) that responds with 50% more sarcasm and swears than the average assistant. Need someone to insult you while answering your questions? SnarkyBot's got your back.

So, in conclusion, FictionCorp is dominating the AI game, like a boss. We've crushed the AI mention count of those NVIDIA amateurs with our 69th generation AI technology. We're turning dreams into reality, one ""AI"" at a time, while keeping the shareholders rolling in the green like a 420-themed casino. So, strap in and join us on this wild AI ride, because we're about to blow your fucking minds! Thank you and fuck yeah!",t3_13seeyy,1685163988.0,3

**TL;DR -**  

The post discusses expected earning reports of five different companies, namely CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Salesforce (CRM), C3.ai (AI), Okta (OKTA), and Nordstrom (JWN), outlining their recent performances, anticipated challenges, and future projections based on industry trends. The author offers a bullish stance on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA, while expressing skepticism towards JWN.

### Facts

* üìà CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is predicted to report an increase in earnings, driven by the rising demand for its products due to heightened global security needs. However, increased R&D and sales/marketing expenses might impact its bottom line.
* üåê Salesforce (CRM) is expected to post significant earnings, nearly double compared to the previous year, thanks to its strategically built digital transformation portfolio. However, macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and geopolitical issues could pose challenges.
* üß† C3.ai (AI) is benefiting from the growing interest in artificial intelligence, with its stock having more than doubled recently. The company is expanding its product portfolio and partnerships, which is expected to boost its Q4 revenues.
* üîê Okta (OKTA) is predicted to report earnings growth compared to losses in the same quarter last year. The increased use of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio are expected to drive its profits.
* üõçÔ∏è Nordstrom (JWN) is expected to report a decline in earnings, reflecting reduced consumer spending amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite efforts to enhance customer experience and technology advancement, high markdowns are likely to impact its gross margin.",t3_13wrcad,1685557773.0,16

Of course it could grow and make a bigger share, but it could just as well go down. ChatGPT is a high-risk investment with potencial high reward but most probably it will go down. If the mean expectation would be different, then the investment would be different as well. That is how investments in this league are executed. 10 billion is a fair price by definition. Both the company and the market keep it simple: a 10 billion investment is worth 10 billion until it has proven otherwise.

To be fair Microsoft has integrated other companies rather well over the last 35 years. But those strategic synergies are priced in of course. They have been priced in before ChatGPT was founded. That's why Microsoft's earning's ratio is higher than most companies.

An investment theory must be based on the market. That the *fair price* is for some reason wrong. That some specific circumstance is not accurately priced in yet.

A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.

Stocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.

Bonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship‚Äîwhen demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease.",t3_13u0n86,1685307775.0,2

6651,jm6z4ya,t1_jm6udmp,"A scalp to the upside if momentum is there. Still not too interested in the upside here unless we can build a demand wall at 420. But here's what I see...

On the M15 chart, our trading range is between 422.92 and 419.78, with the current trade happening in the upper part of this range. We have a Fair Value Gap (FVG) of 420.75 to 422.04 which could be filled if we notice a shift in trend at 421.94. If such a trend shift occurs, I'll search for chances to buy in the discount zone and at the 15-minute order block (420.49 - 419.78). Bullish investors must maintain the price above 419.21. If the price drops below 419.21, we'll focus on the hourly Fair Value Gaps and order block.

Buy-side Discounts:

* 421.34 (50%)
* 420.97 (62%)
* 420.72 (70%)
* 420.44 (79%)
* 419.78(100%). 

Targets: 

* 422.92 (0%) (T.P. 1)
* 413.77 (-27%) (T.P. 2)
* 424.87 (-62%) (T.P. 3)
* I plan to set out today if it runs and catch it to the downside.  Here is what I'm looking at, though.

AMD have branched out into both markets and have tried to use this to get people to buy an AMD CPU and GPU (if you have both they can share memory and work better.) although NVDA are working on a CPU which would remove the advantage AMD has with its smart memory.

AMD won this round in the datacenter sector. Intel won in the consumer sector. Healthy competition is great. 

I never trashed AMD. 

I said the stock has a PE ratio double that of intel, and that INTC is a better stock buy. AMD is overvalued compared to INTC. AMD needs 100% growth in earnings and to stay at its current stock price to be an equally valueable purchase as INTC stock. 

The company is doing great right now and thats all well and good. But these metrics exist for a reason. Not knowing this shit is why people are suprised when TSLA tanks after earnings reports that show good news. Because when the company grows by 10% and its PE ratio suggests a priced in 800% growth, that 10% growth reported on earnings is actually terrible.",t3_zrkv2i,1671646403.0,5
6754,j1ioudw,t1_j1icbpn,"Of course not. But revenues do not maintain those kinds of shifts in growth/decline either. Particularily in a scenario like this one. 

Two companies dominate the same market with little to no outside competition. One company, the smaller of the two rolls out a successful line of product while the other has a botched release and a 10 month delay. The smaller company grabs up a disproportionately large portion of the market share during that time. 

So yes on paper the smaller co posts high percentage growth, while the other posts decline. Thats all well and good. 

But it would be very foolish to assume that those numbers on paper will maintain the elevated growth/decline. AMD will not beat INTCs chips every round, and INTC will not have catastrophic production problems every round either. Also, rest assured they will be out for blood with AMD up their ass, and likely will be pushing their tech to the absolute limit in the coming cycles rather than the relaxed slow drip theyre used to doing without competition. 

anyway, AMD had a disproportionately good year, and INTC had a bad one. Alot of factors go into that whole battle, and I dont think it is a smart move to buy the top of the more speculative of the two. If AMD doesnt maintain the big growth the stock comes crashing down even on good earnings, because speculative investers are assuming to repeat those 40% increases in revenue. And rest assured, they WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT maintain 40% revenue growth for too long.No company can. It was a perfect storm for them to get there. If they come in with one ER showing only a modest 5% growth, the stock implodes. Thats the nature of overvalued growth stocks.

I do not hold positions in either of these stocks. If I were to make a play, I would wait for INTC to rollout their new datacenter chips early January, which will officially fall very short of beating AMDs recent release. INTC. Will likely take a big hit and if so I would either go long long INTC on the drop, or long dated puts AMD if it pumps more.",t3_zrkv2i,1671904864.0,1

This will not be an AI winter like we have had in the past; there may be a lowering of expectations, but the tools that became possible to build in the last 3 months are already good enough to be highly disruptive.

EDIT: I should elaborate a bit. In the past, the AI winters were preceded by the actual academic goalposts (not the fucking marketing!) being placed boldly in the sand, and then missing spectacularly. It was driven by academics.

In contrast, what we have now is more of a possible AI bubble. The academic goalposts are being SMASHED, year after year for about 8 years now.

The marketing has gotten a bit ahead of itself. But the technology landscape this time is truly different, unlike last times.

The bottom of this bubble would be a contraction in their current value, not an end to future growth. An AI winter would be if this all turned out to be bullshit. It‚Äôs not.",t3_119on3f,1677169596.0,2

You can call pre-BERT LLMs large language models if you want, but it really is not exaggerating in the slightest to say that word2vec + transformer architecture changed things so completely that it nearly amounted to throwing everything out that came before (from a technology perspective, not necessarily a fundamental mathematical perspective).

NLP before word2vec is completely disconnected from NLP after word2vec; that happened in 2013, and really people couldn‚Äôt practically use word embedding til late 2014. It‚Äôs as close to throwing out a field of research as I‚Äôve ever witnessed.

And then we didn‚Äôt get BERT (and the transformer architecture) until late 2018. While
BERT relied on plenty of other neural network research that had been done leading up to it, particular attention architectures, it had legitimately revolutionary results.

If you're copy-pasting chatGPT code, then you're one bad programmer. Writing the code for, ""Hello World"" in ""literally any language"" != being a programmer in any language. If you had paid attention, you'll see that most codes spouted by GPT is still usually wrong. The more complex the task, the worse the quality. It messes up simple image recognition code for a neural networks, you have to tell it what it did wrong and then *maybe* it will get things right, if it ever does. It *almost always* cites completely wrong literature, betraying the flaws of its current architecture, a probability machine ""with attention"". Even after repeatedly being told that the citations were completely wrong, it never corrected itself and was stuck in a loop of wrong DOIs and fabricated paper titles/author names. And GPT 3 was trained on data till September 2021, so it's not really that outdated. It's still a machine trained on data, and even with 45 TB of training data, it falls short of emulating human expertise significantly.

There is still a long way to go, and there will always be need of an expert to supervise what GPT or any other LLM construes as a ""logical, coherent"" sentence, whether human or programming languages. It is good for, ""having conversations"" with chat bots. But it's nowhere near being a substitute for an expert or human creativity. Could easily be a decade or at least 5 years away. When they release GPT 4, we'll see how far its logical inference has improved - and I am using that term generously in context of a LLM.",t3_12dz6w5,1680864918.0,5

7064,iv0x2tu,t3_ylid36,"2023 is going to be a very rough year for Meta. Advertising is the first segment to be cut from budgets when times are tough. Zuckerberg himself mentioned [this](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/meta-alphabet-comcast-warn-on-lower-ad-spend) back in July with google and Comcast execs also agreeing. 
At the same time you have companies like Disney and Netflix introducing ad-supported options which means fewer ad dollars to go around for everyone else.

> They could stretch spending over 2 years instead of 1

Meta hasn‚Äôt mentioned doing this though.

The long-term CFO leaving on apparent arguments earlier this year was a big sign that she just did not agree with the financial plan and was not able to do her job basically due to Zuck.

I do think the company is interesting, especially to average down soon. But feels like we can't rely on the spending making a turnaround, he might go full steam ahead even in a big recession.

I thought like $150 ish was a safe price, thinking the company could run really lean in a recession. But I'm realizing Meta has barely ever even operated in a severe recession. They might not know how and Zuck controlling spending is not a good look.",t3_ylid36,1667558391.0,2

$amd ran ~30% on a bombshell that nvidia is skullfucking them.  i don't know how anyone could see nvda's er/q2 guide and think it's good for amd.  amd already guided.  

amd's event yesterday was a commercial for nvidia.  they claimed a $30B 2023 TAM and then said they won't have products til 2024.

amd has no software.  it's cuda vs... open source.

the first bunch of mi300s are headed to el capitan for low margin.

they refused to show any benchmarks vs the h100, so the performance is still a big unknown.

amd also just wasted ~90% of the presentation talking about epyc, which is now basically rendered moot.  epyc is the superior datacenter cpu... but datacenter is now pulling a 180 and switching to being gpu-centric, via the ai play.

7275,j57j0re,t3_10guyv7,"I'm well into a decade buying msft and won't stop anytime soon, while they are up in the air over hololens 3 still, the fact they are pushing in so many realistic and intelligent directions that will position them well for the next decade while their competitors flounder around and fail project after project just makes me buy more. I think their commercial applications for augmented reality solves a lot of the ""work at home"" issues (interaction with co workers, sharing of workflows/data etc) while realistically heading in the only evenitable direction for the future of humanity.. that of the work at home environment (in a lot of industries). It's wildly inefficient to make people drive in to a large office you have to pay to heat, pay for electricity, pay property tax on, etc etc etc when eventually tech like hololens will make all the benefits redundant.    Which will imo also fuel one of the hugest societal shifts in human history, the shift back to smaller communities and away from condensed city life,because if you can work effectively remotely, then you can hire the best candidate from across the world, or likewise you can work for the best company.. there's no point in paying obscene rent to live in a closet for that when you can get a much nicer property in a smaller town with all the required amenities for much cheaper,and livea much happier existence. 
  
That is the most efficient and cost effective way forward imo, which is typically the route that ends up being taken.. likely decades away but the fact management sees that and is making an allowance for it already makes me bullish AF.  
  
They have so many 5head plays it's honestly incredible.. unlike google who keeps dropping the ball with their projects, Microsoft seems to be nailing it and even in their failures they pivot to a strength;. 
  
When Xbox One was first coming out it got a lot of bad press because it was supposed to have a mandatory ""always online"" feature.. but what wasn't reported that much was that was part of a new market system Microsoft was creating so users could buy and sell their digital game licenses. You buy the game online, play it, then sell it to someone else.. Microsoft of course would get a cut, but you as the consumer would have an opportunity to sell your game licenses.    Of course publishing studios lost their shit and started a huge ad campaign to destroy it, and they capitulated, but that was the groundwork for what became game pass, which has been a huge success so far, as well as their ""play anywhere"" forced game license sharing across all their platforms much to the chagrin of many publishers.

I think the push MS is making into gaming is raising regulatory eyebrows now, not sure they will be allowed to build a monopoly position and frankly they should not be allowed to anyway.

7395,jo82ndj,t3_11nuu67,"Line by line in specific regard to Microsoft Office, as, this is the big subscriber number we are talking about for company revenue.

1) Improved language processing: With advancements in language processing, future iterations of Microsoft Office's natural language processing capabilities could offer enhanced understanding and processing of human language. This could lead to improved features in applications like Microsoft Word, where the software could better understand complex sentence structures, nuances of language, and contextual cues. It might provide more accurate grammar and style suggestions, assist with language translation, or offer intelligent content organization based on the context of the document.

2) Enhanced creativity: Microsoft Office applications like PowerPoint, Word, or even Excel could incorporate AI models with enhanced creativity. For example, PowerPoint might offer AI-generated design suggestions, helping users create visually appealing and creative presentations. Microsoft Word could provide assistance with generating original content, such as creative writing prompts or suggestions for engaging introductions. Excel might incorporate AI-powered data visualization suggestions, helping users present data in more visually impactful ways.

3) Better problem-solving: Microsoft Excel, with improved computing power and AI capabilities, could become more adept at solving complex problems. It might offer advanced mathematical functions and solvers that assist with complex calculations or optimization problems. Excel could also integrate AI-powered plug-ins for scientific analysis, hypothesis testing, or data-driven decision-making (like Stock Trades, yay!). Additionally, AI-assisted chatbots within Microsoft Teams could provide support in problem-solving scenarios by offering intelligent recommendations or guiding users through troubleshooting steps.

4) Increased personalization: Microsoft Office applications could leverage user-specific data and AI algorithms to personalize the user experience. For instance, Microsoft Outlook might provide personalized email suggestions based on an individual's writing style and past interactions. Microsoft Word could offer customized document templates or formatting options based on a user's preferences and historical document usage patterns. PowerPoint might suggest slide layouts and designs tailored to the user's presentation style and previous presentations.

5) Improved multi-lingual capabilities: Microsoft Office applications could incorporate advanced language translation features. For instance, Microsoft Word might integrate improved translation tools to facilitate seamless communication across different languages within documents. PowerPoint could offer real-time language translation during presentations, enabling presenters to engage with audiences who speak different languages. Additionally, Microsoft Teams could leverage enhanced multi-lingual capabilities, allowing for more effective collaboration and communication among team members from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

**All-in, I see a big potential - and the stock is very much a buy or hold for many as a result.**

Microsoft are extremely adept at altering their software for changes in markets, and this is where the 'home-working' functionality is looking extremely positive, as a small example of them giving businesses the tools they need to push push push for more functions.

&#x200B;

As more people work from home - the impact on companies is now clear: people working from home are being paid less, yet, earn more as they no longer have to travel. This will lead to an increase in disposable income, impacting consumer demand.

If personal taxation was lowered, this would/could be a thing which drags economies out of the debt they are in. I am expanding your point I will admit, but this is part of a bigger topic than just 'hey MSFT is releasing AI'.

This leads to pressure to lower personal income tax at government levels globally.

More people working form home under contract.

No more need to 'learn to code'

No more need to 'learn how to create an manage a database'

No more need to 'take a night class to learn how to do X in Y Microsoft product to get Z job/position'.

&#x200B;

Least we not forget, MS Office is available for Apple products...",t3_11nuu67,1686835655.0,1

I'm not trying to say consumer is close to industrial, far from, i use both professionally, and there's not a comparison yet.. but for the price.. consumer is getting pretty decently close, close enough and agile enough to run a small business with great success. 

DM has tapped into the metal at home printing as well, which SSYS is buying with their purchase and folding into their portfolio. What I really want to see is china start entering that market to push both innovation and costs for the consumer/business and open up the market for small guys who can't quite afford 100k+ yet

If you read the definitions you will find this:  


**Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.

Happy to answer any questions tho in the mean time.

Read the definitions at the bottom‚Ä¶ try to wrap your head around comparing HV to IV. That is really the core principle.

From there you can interpret if options are cheap or are expensive.

Each table is just the ‚Äútop‚Äù options that meet that criteria.

Sell expensive, buy cheap. Higher efficiency better than low. Watch out for earnings, or make a play on them but don‚Äôt be surprised.

Or a retailer could use Midjourney's image generator to quickly create product photos for their website without having to hire professional photographers.

2. The industries that will be most disrupted by LLM-driven AI are those where humans currently perform tasks that could easily be automated by chatbots or other computer programs.

If you go to verify all the claims that OpenAI, Meta and Google do about the logic/math capabilities of their LLM, you'll see the kind of problems the models have been tested on. Just cherry picking of problems on which a language model can do decently.

Again, language model are only good to predict a ""next token"", producing plausible text. They don't do math and don't do logic, which is instead necessary for replacing a somehow skilled worker doing the jobs you mentioned.

Self-reflection and assessment loops are also being added to iterate toward grounded responses that meet assessed success criteria of user queries. And mass-scale reinforcement learning has proven transformative for rapidly reducing ""hallucinations"" and driving toward more accurate and helpful responses.

Your assessment is correct from the perspective of an ML developer. But I think it is short-sighted.

Consider this: If you zoom in anywhere on my nervous system, you could make a similar claim about the limits of the system. My hands have intelligence that can automatically pull away from burning heat without stopping to check with my executive functions, but that system simply can't conceive of or communicate strategic plans. My amygdala drives some basic and also some very undesirable behaviors. I could go on. But the point is that these systems are intelligent.

>TL;DR: The market is becoming more sensitive to sudden changes influenced by the VIX. Traders should exercise caution in this market environment. Those with long positions may consider adding hedges to protect their investments, while others should keep a close eye on the MSI and VIX to identify potential market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly.",t3_13kenu4,1684358887.0,1
7611,jkk7zzm,t3_13kenu4,">Given the current market sentiment, here are some potential scenarios for SPY on 5/18/2023:  
>  
>Bullish Scenario: If the market continues to show resilience as it has in recent days, we could see a continuation of the upward trend. This could be further supported if there's positive news from the meeting between McCarthy and Biden regarding the debt ceiling agreement. In this case, SPY could potentially move towards the flipping point at a strike of 417.1, as indicated by the GEX analysis.  
>  
>Bearish Scenario: If the market reacts negatively to the declining MACD on the weekly chart and the slowing GDP growth, we could see a downward movement in SPY. This could be exacerbated if there's no agreement on the debt ceiling, leading to a potential market sell-off.  
>  
>Neutral Scenario: Given the mixed market sentiment indicated by the MSI and VIX signals, the market could also remain relatively stable, with SPY oscillating around its current levels.

I initially bought Geni as a pure sports play, but I have done considerable research on their Second Spectrum acquisition and believe this could be a game changer for the company and possibly the future of Chat GPT.

The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the precautionary principle.

Yes, I do think one path of the AI and metaverse will be influencer and celebrity avatars powered by AI.

It's fascinating what the implications are, but imagine you could meet your favorite Twitch streamer, or movie celebrity powered by AI in the metaverse.

In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.

I'm actually betting that AI will become a big part of AR/VR. That's what most people aren't realizing.

There's a lot of immersive technology that AI can provide in the metaverse, as I mentioned.

AI agents will be able to replicate the movement and mind of any human being or persona, and once you create a digital realm, i.e. metaverse in which they can reside, you will be able to visit them in person and interact with them in the metaverse like you couldn't in real life except go to a concert or ask for an autograph from a celebrity.

If you could have infinite dynamic experiences of a movie world with the characters of that movie, wouldn't you spend endless amounts of time in your favorite ""reality""? If you are a LOTR fan for example, you could live in that world recreated/generated by AI. The possibilities are endless, once the infrastructure and technology, i.e. AI and VR/AR are ready.

What we are seeing with the interest in AI chatbots now are that most people just want to have some kind of connection, even if it's not a real human connection. If it can mimic a human well enough, that is good enough for them.

Do you know the amount of money people already pay for a human connection now? AI persona agents and immersive realities will be a goldmine.",t3_1162spp,1676825717.0,2

3/ there is a massive lack of developer activity around the XR space. Compare that with crypto project.

I will compare that to the chatbot industry. Last decade, everybody tried to find the formula between assistant like Siri and Alexa, to a chatbot engine like IBM Watson or Dialogflow from google.

Generative AI can create storylines and plots and take your input or actions and generate ""dream"" worlds that are alive and in any reality you feed it, like movies.

Instead now Microsoft can easily give it to the US military for more use. Seen this with the hololens we don't see the dangers of it now but in the future we'll have more weapons to use.

There are several reasons why:

1) You've included companies with an earnings announcement more than 120 days away. While this might be fine for some investors, it's certainly not ideal for those looking to invest in the near-term.

2) Many of the stocks on this list are small-cap or micro-cap stocks, which tend to be much more volatile and risky than their large-cap counterparts. For example, Company XYZ on your list has a market cap of just $50 million while Company ABC has a market cap of over $10 billion. Given that fact, it's no surprise that XYZ would be much riskier than ABC.",t3_137lp59,1683209173.0,6

They have many APIs that could be enhanced by partnering with an AI language model like ChatGPT. Moreover, FDS has already made strides in natural language processing (NLP) with their Factset Query Language (FQL), which allows users to make natural language queries to financial data. However, they could further improve their NLP capabilities by leveraging the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). This would enable them to develop more sophisticated interfaces and improve the accuracy and speed of financial data analysis.

I don't know what you mean here.

Ther's a motivation why if you access Google from Edge It asks you to set It as the favorite search page, Bing does the same: the added revenue generated from searches Is important for the respective companies.

- We do not have any idea how they work
- We don't know what even older models are cable of (there full range of capabilities)
- We don't know what abilities models will gain as we scale them
