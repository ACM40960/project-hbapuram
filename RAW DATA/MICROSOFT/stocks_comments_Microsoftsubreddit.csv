Chatgpt and similar is right now riding on the marketing train at the moment( and Msft is catapulting that marketing train even faster now) 

And because of the Marketing buzzz its gotten yet- its getting a massive influx of users( and data) into its systems, combine this with already available data out there.

And because openai is still relatively a small company, it can afford to fuck up and the negative press coverage is buried( or less prominent) than Google or other companies. 

MSFT doesnt even care about the negative shit because its a 3rd party service( and they are reaping  the benefits)

They are at the moment just keeping it safe because google 100% understands the power it holds.

I'm struggling to see this play out to be positive revenue for Microsoft (but can totally see the case for it causing revenue lost by Google). It seems that the path to disruption is easy, breaking someone else's business model. Building up your own at that point seems a bit more difficult.

Right now the big problem with these language learning models is that they're not yet reliable/trustworthy. Interfering with the results with premature monetization will jeopardize their position in a critical time for adoption.

The SEO cat and mouse game is going to get really, really weird in the coming years, as some kind of meta adversarial network where competing AIs try to outmaneuver the others, while simultaneously poisoning the well of language data that the models train from. 

So if Bing (or anyone else) starts prioritizing more profitable answers over more accurate answers, the quality of the service won't get to the point where it's actually people's first choice. If the serious searches still go to ""Google Classic,"" and Bing (or any LLM) can't generate enough revenue to cover the cost of a search.

Samsung and Microsoft already saw this play out with Bixby and Cortana. And Amazon is struggling to monetize Alexa. Merely having the default position on a popular physical device doesn't make the service actually competitive.

509,j3uuytm,t3_108b31n,"I really think that OpenAI's vision has serious flaws. In my opinion, they are operating under the assumption that they can achieve limitless potential by simply throwing more data and computing power at their system. But this is not considering the fact that it has no concept of truth.   
  
I'm no AI expert, but I do understand why Google's Waymo division isn't worried about Tesla FSD. They recognize that the approach being taken by Tesla is fundamentally flawed, and Google has been a leader in AI development for years so they know what they are talking about. It's clear to me that OpenAI won't disrupt Google anytime soon unless Sam Altman is willing to make some drastic changes.   
  
I believe there needs to be an understanding of where the limitations of OpenAI lie before any real progress can be made. If all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail and without knowing the limits of your hammer it becomes very difficult to create anything useful from it. And if OpenAI doesn't create something useful then it won't stand up against Google or any other tech giant for that matter.   
  
This brings me back to Sam Altman's vision for OpenAI which I fear may be overly optimistic at best, and misguided at worst. He must make adjustments to his original plan if he wants any chance of competing in this space. Otherwise, it'll likely just be another failed attempt at revolutionizing artificial intelligence as we know it today - when in reality all that was needed was a more realistic goal set from the beginning instead of grandiose dreams with little substance behind them.",t3_108b31n,1673414627.0,0

*Microsoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3*

**Microsoft's investment into ChatGPT's creator may be the smartest $1 billion ever spent**  
In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion into the nonprofit artificial intelligence research outfit OpenAI, cofounded by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and a group of others just over seven years ago. Financial details of the Microsoft deal weren't disclosed at the time, but MIT Tech Review reported in 2020 that the $1 billion was split between cash and credits for Azure, Microsoft's cloud business.  
Apart from the potential huge ROI, Microsoft's deal only looks smarter as more details emerge. The Information reported that the company would integrate ChatGPT into Bing. As Insider's Emilia David writes, that will potentially end Google's two decades search dominance. Gil Luria, director of research at DA Davidson, an investment bank, wrote in a note that ""Microsoft deserves a premium valuation relative to the market"" with its ""investment in OpenAI as a source of a potential huge upside.""  
""We believe Microsoft's investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside,"" Luria wrote. He added that  ""the unprecedented activity"" in ChatGPT is ""translating to incremental volumes for Azure."" OpenAI expects $1 billion in revenue by 2024, according to Reuters. DA Davidson expects those levels to increase significantly.  
In December 2015, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others announced the formation of non-profit venture OpenAI. The organization stated it would ""freely collaborate"" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. Musk resigned from the board in February 2018.   
In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit when Microsoft announced an investment package of US$1 billion into the company. The company distributed equity to its employees, and OpenAI then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.  
**Elon Musk slams Microsoft**  
Microsoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3, a natural language AI-powered tool made by OpenAI. Elon Musk voiced his discontent on Twitter that OpenAI — the AI research firm he helped found — is exclusively licensing its famous natural language software GPT-3 to Microsoft. Microsoft announcement was met with dismay on Twitter from users who had thought OpenAI's mission statement was to make technologies like GPT-3 widely available to the public. Elon Musk, who cofounded the company in 2015 as a non-profit AI research body, was among those who criticized the deal.  
  
""This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft,"" he said.

**Microsoft exclusively licenses OpenAI’s groundbreaking GPT-3**

***Sep 22, 2020***

Microsoft’s deal with San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research company OpenAI includes an exclusive license on the AI firm’s groundbreaking GPT-3 language model, an auto-generating text program that’s emerged as the most sophisticated of its kind in the industry.

Microsoft has been entwined for years with OpenAI through OpenAI’s use of the Azure cloud computing platform, with Azure being how OpenAI accesses the vast computing resources it needs to train many of its models. Last year, Microsoft made a major $1 billion investment in OpenAI, a deal which now involves being the exclusive licensee for GPT-3. Which raises some interesting questions about how exactly Microsoft has acquired this exclusive license. A Microsoft spokesperson tells The Verge that its exclusive license gives it unique access to the underlying code of GPT-3, which contains technical advancements it hopes to integrate into its products and services.

So, while other companies and researchers may be able to access GPT-3 through OpenAI’s API, only Microsoft will reap the profits of getting to make use of all the AI advancements that went into making it such a sophisticated program. It’s not clear what that will look like right now, but what is clear is that Microsoft sees immense value in OpenAI’s work and likely wants to be the first (and, in this case, only) company to take its largely experimental research work and translate it into real-world product advancements.",t3_108b31n,1673396225.0,1

They changed from their old ways hence why they started succeeding, which was my point.

I can continue my list as well, in detail because I'm not a corporate worshipper despite investing in MSFT for decades:

1. Visio(Cost $1.375 billion), failed as a standalone product and was eventually integrated into Office365

2. Great Plains Software($1.1 billion) and Navision($1.7 billion), both failed as standalone product after acquisition despite being 2 of the top 4 accounting apps on the market of their time. Both shut down and was combined into Microsoft Dynamics GP

3. aQuantive($6 billion), most well known failure outside of Skype. This is Microsoft's answer to Google Ads, I don't think I need to go into details about how it ended up being a complete write off as noted by MSFT.

I can also list down tons of game studios and other products/services that failed. All tech companies have their fair share of failure, my point is that MSFT's best success are acquisitions that they don't touch after purchase. Stop inferring the wrong points.",t3_108b31n,1673390591.0,-2

914,imgns3p,t3_x1fjlg,"I did this type of analysis on MF , but a long time ago, back in the early 2000s.  What I noticed is that all the stocks that made their lists had this nice run, about 20%-40% gain and then they would hit the list.  And at the end of the day, for all the work in following, purchasing, selling, ***and if you 'missed***' one of the picks that did well, you way under-performed the averages. (e.g. they often have 1-2 picks out of the entire port that do very very well and bring the entire average up).

I dropped them after they seemed to become 'corp shills' and it felt like they were just 'searching' for stocks to recommend vs. finding gems or doing any real research.

I'd really love to find a research firm that does deep dive research.  I've followed enough stocks and even been in enough companies that I see what the insiders are doing WAY before the public does.

961,imed771,t1_imdjp20,"At the risk of coming off as a Fool shill, let me make one comment. I was a member of their RuleBreakers group that picked 2 stocks a month. I was a member back in 2010 and blindly bought whatever they recommended. Results were ‘meh’ at best. So I dropped them. Restarted with the same RB service later around 2017. But this time I added some additional screens of my own on top of their picks. I did a huge deep dive analysis of all their picks going back 10 years. What I found is that there was a significant correlation in a stocks performance over time to the price of the stock at recommendation. 

I don’t have the spreadsheet around anymore, but I analyzed their returns based on the price at the time of recommendation.  I know, it seems illogical, but almost all of their picks that were under $40 at recommendation were phenomenal. Something like 15 of 18 were positive, 12 were up over 300%, 4 were over 1000%. I know what you are thinking, market cap should matter more than the stock price…but I’m only telling you what I found. 

So I started buying only stuff under $40 with rare exceptions I’d buy something above that price. I didn’t have a single loser after that, and two that went up over 1000%. The problem is that you might only get 1 out 2 recommendation a year that fall in that under $40 club.

1057,imjptse,t1_imjkdal,"I am looking for something similar to zacks research wizard. For example looking for various stocks based on fundamental screening and calculation. In zacks I can set criteria for screening, set the backtesting period, how long the stock should be held in portfolio and stop loss if desired. From what I have tested so far the individual trades seem to be consistent with what the stock was really doing at that point in time. So for example if a stock has met the desired criteria and Zacks was opening a trade and closing it a week later, it seemed to be consistent with the movement of that trade on other online sites.

But I do agree that it looks very very old and it is questionable if it gets updated in the future. Also it lacks many basic stock information for which it always has to open a website. Hence it is easier to use some web based backtesting right away.",t3_x1fjlg,1661966829.0,1

Stanovich argued that these beliefs have no valid evidence and thus might have been an example of dysrationalia.\[1\]: 503  Sternberg countered that ""No one has yet conclusively proven any of these beliefs to be false"", so endorsement of the beliefs should not be considered evidence of dysrationalia.\[5\] Stanovich's rebuttal to Sternberg explained that the purpose of the example was to question the epistemic rationality of the process by which people arrived at their unlikely conclusions, a process of evaluating the quality of arguments and evidence for and against each conclusion, not to assume irrationality based on the content of the conclusion alone.\[7\]""

The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms.  It's an extremely artificial definition.  It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors *in general* - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.  All of which should give you pause before making the *additional* conclusion, which the article *does not make*, which is that ""everyone should LSI"".

>And if your argument is that one outperforms the other but some people don't prefer to do it because of psychological reasons that is one hell of a goal post move.

No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that *more* of the people you tell to do this will *lose* than if you had just held your tongue.",t3_13rxgz6,1685139798.0,1

You've done nothing of the sort. You highlighted the one paragraph that had a downside and declared victory like a child. 

>The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms. It's an extremely artificial definition.

What definition wouldn't be extremely artificial? Should Moses walk down from a mountain with the definition carved into tablets by lighting? 

>It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors in general - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.

Again, this is irrelevant to the argument about performance. If your argument is that people shouldn't LSI because psychologically they can't handle then fine, but that is not what you said and it is a pretty obvious end run around the fact that ""statistically speaking"" LSI generates better returns. 

>No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is 

This is the type of argument that would lead you to invest in nothing but treasury bonds.

>the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that more of the people you tell to do this will lose than if you had just held your tongue.

Good point, let's tell them to put in under a mattress. That'll do them good. If your sole goal is minimization of nominal losses you shouldn't be investing into any stock... ever. Is that your proposal? 

>All of which should give you pause before making the additional conclusion, which the article does not make, which is that ""everyone should LSI"".

Generative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.

The whole point is that the race is already here. We're in it. But that's exactly where the danger is. 

If you look in popular fiction like Terminator you will see a General hook up Skynet to all military systems and cause the apocalypse. You think wow that's really dumb why would you do that... But what if AI managed flight plans save billions of dollars or dozens of lives? What if giving AI access to optimize your data center means you will save billions compared to your competitors? If you don't do it your competitor will.

There will always be people who are chasing efficiency and profit wanting to push the boundaries of AI.

The only way out of this arms race is to agree together to be careful. It's exactly like the nuclear non proliferation treaties... not that that has fully prevented countries like North Korea from developing more nukes.

AGI, the thing we are afraid of, is at least an order of magnitude out of reach. There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything ""live and organic and thinking"". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).

AI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain ""skilled labor positions"" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a ""regular"" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.

But if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a ""untrained"" AI.

Western governments will be outsourcing to Palantir based on this war? Wrong. They’ve been heavily involved in western governments from the get go, see above or below. Here is a rand study from 2007 ffs.

>Palantir intelligence analysis software is used by analysts across the intelligence community (IC) to analyze raw intelligence data collected across a variety of sources. Palantir software integrates information from multiple intelligence databases to help intelligence analysts investigate linkages, sort through data, and organize intelligence information. Palantir was privately developed by Palantir Technologies and was procured as a joint urgent operational need (JUON) for forces deployed to OEF. It is used to varying degrees by military members of the IC as an alternative to the Distributed Common Ground Sensor (DCGS) family of intelligence analysis programs, which are programs of record. See Appendix C: Palantir Case Study for details.

I don't feel that it's something that should be easily looked over or just as easily dismissed.

It's like a competition between a comparatively average someone sitting in US mid west eating chips netflix and chillin' vs the person about to make their second ascent on Everest.

While there's nothing really separating the two in terms of technology, the Everest climber would have put in the time, found the right investors, developed the connections, and gained the experience to get there.  

The moat is less technology than it is experience, connections, determination, and culture.

If you compare Palantir as the plucky elementary school kid saying they're going to be a defense contractor someday, 20 years later, they're on the field standing shoulder to shoulder Lockheed, Raytheon, et al.  Anduril is even crazier since they've only been around since Palmer Luckey left Meta/Facebook 7 years ago and benefitting from all the headwork the current leadership gained while working at Palantir.

Palantir braved the headwinds, but they also brought up other companies under their wing.  While I'll agree the SPAC investment problem like WEJO is a huge issue, potentially a job losing event for the finance director that made that call, Palantir is currently profitable, albeit at regular growth vs high growth expected of tech, it does still say that their way of doing business is working.

Data scientist here.  It depends on the customer scale.  When writing normal software, say Youtube, you need a new server process (or subprocess) for each user logging in.  A million users and you've got a million processes.  When you're developing it, you only need 1 process worth of computation.

LLMs are different.  They take tons of resources to train, a massive amount of resources, and this is for one scientist making the initial model.  Then when it's done it can run easily with 10,000x less resources.  But if you have 100k users, already you need 10x the resources.

Open source doesn't tend to host services like Youtube, they create software and the end user can run it on their own hardware.  Because of this, you need around 10,000x more hardware to build the thing than to have users run it.  

If open source wants to do anything LLM then the people doing that need to rent servers on AWS or similar just like the companies do.

Natural languages are polymorphic, meaning the meaning for a word changes based on its context, what it is referring to irl.  Then the only way to translate natural language well is to know the world, so Google set out a new kind of ML to pre-train on Wikipedia articles so it could learn language and then translate better.

It's a philosophical concept that can be argued that no idea is an original idea, since every idea is based on experience.

My examples were to counter your thoughts that AI couldn't replace high class dining which I refuted by saying that it could.

AI is very capable of creating original ideas given a seed generation to build on has enough noise to give it a starting point. This is no different than a human taking a random concept and then building on it.

For example, given the AI has enough input on the world, it could make connections and ""ideas"" beyond anything a human may. It could connect the properties of cake icing to causing cancer because of a chemical compound and reviewing the statistics it has to cake fatalities. Just like a human needs experience to come up with ideas it wouldn't so outlandish to first setup the AI to come up with medical research, and from there give it random words to see if it can link these words to medical research. It doesn't even have to be random either, it can be a helper AI feeding input and feeding instructions.

Human input is optional, human intervention won't be necessary within our lifetime.

Palantir has invested significant resources in automating things like data pipeline generation.  They've also worked on creating an independent user community so that customers can use the software with less or no help from Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) teams.

Engineers use a litany of tools already to optimize and generate new code for them.

Along these same lines, there are several ORMs that make mapping API models to databases easy as heck.

You still need to know what the code is doing when you use these tools; and that is where some of these ""AI gonna take devs jerbs"" people are sort of lacking in their knowledge. Software engineering is all about abstraction, and ChatGPT is another way to abstract out problems. Instead of focusing on dirty code level details, engineers can spend more time focusing on higher level design, documentation and conceptualization.

Or a very likely possibility is that the data could just leak one day as a huge database anyone could download.

Nova:

Yes, I can definitely help you create a business plan for an ice cream shop. A business plan is an important document that outlines your company's goals, strategies, and financial projections. Here's an outline of what your ice cream shop business plan should include:

1. Executive Summary: This section should give an overview of your ice cream shop, including the vision and mission statement, brief history, and key highlights.

2. Market Analysis: In this section, you should conduct market research to identify your target audience, competitive landscape, and industry trends. You should also discuss any unique selling points that set your ice cream shop apart from competitors.

3. Company Description: This section should provide a more detailed description of your ice cream shop, including the location, store design, and staffing.

4. Services and Products: In this section, you should outline your ice cream shop's products and services, including any unique flavors, toppings, or packaging options.

5. Marketing and Sales: This section should describe your marketing and sales strategy, including how you plan to attract customers, retain them, and increase sales.

6. Operations and Management: In this section, you should describe the daily operations of your ice cream shop, including staff roles, inventory management, and customer service.

7. Financial Projections: This section should provide detailed financial projections, including startup costs, revenue and expense forecasts, and break-even analysis.

8. Funding Request: If you are seeking funding for your ice cream shop, this section should outline the amount of funding you need, how it will be used, and your repayment plan.

Overall, a business plan for an ice cream shop should be comprehensive, detail-oriented, and well-researched to ensure the success of your business.

so it is lose-lose situation for them anyway.

first lose, they can't add the rival AI, because other company produced the product already.

second lose, they can't give the answer right away because they would drastically reduce visits to indexed pages, and business model is based on that that user will visit the pages !!!

2256,j7im0wz,t1_j7hv8s5,"I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but I think you're oversimplifying things because you're forgetting two key factors. 

1) Google brings in a huge chunk of it's revenue from running ads on Google Search. It's their biggest profit driver by far.

2) It's very easy to see how these AI's will start to cannibalize the search market in the medium to long term as their accuracy/etc. improves overtime and it becomes a better product.

So basically, even if Google wins the market and crushes ChatGPT and other competitors, they could still end up losing big overall. These factors are even worse when you consider a few other things: 

* It's been stated that each ChatGPT query consumes significantly more resources then a single search engine query (I've seen articles stating that it's as much 60 times the average search query), meaning it's much more expensive to run then a search engine. Odds are very good that anything Google creates will have this problem as well.

* There seem to be much more limited ways of monetizing this technology. Google Search can sell ads to appear at the top of the search results for certain queries, but ChatGPT type products can't really do that so well. And for as long as the market remains competitive the players are going to be especially limited in how many ads they can try to stuff into these AI's. Because if people feel that Bard or ChatGPT are just constantly shilling advertiser's products then they'll go elsewhere.

Bottom line, regardless of who wins in this AI battle, it DOESN'T mean that the winner will be a good investment. A lot of Dotcom bubble companies that won out were still terrible investments that you could have bought into far cheaper after the hype died down.",t3_10vikbb,1675733514.0,10

No, that's just some horseshit they have made up to justify why they haven't released anything. For example, they could have easily released it as a Google Labs thing or as an experimental beta.

The true reason why Google didn't release any AI service yet is because they could not monetize it to billions of dollars. So senior mgmt kept shooting it down as the ""business case"" is not powerful enough.

But now they got massively embarrassed by a startup and have to do damage control. So they went into all hands on deck scramble mode and quickly announced some of this stuff as damage control. That and the fact that ChatGpt is the first service that proves to be a real threat to their cash cow, which is search (and the advertising dollars that ride on it). And has Microsoft's backing and dollars.

So they have to quickly prove that they too can answer complex questions like ChatGpt can so they stay relevant and dominant in the eyes of users.

I've been following AI development and Big Data development for years - that's my line of work. Please read my post more carefully before jumping to wrong conclusions.

Google is undeniably a leader and pioneer in the AI space. And since you brought it up, so was Yahoo in the Big Data space.

Neither am I diminishing stuff like LaMDA.

My point was super simple but you're refusing to see it. I said that for some reason, Google has been unable to bring any breakthrough AI service to the masses the way ChatGpt did.

That's what they have to hide. Now you can argue that it was because their product managers could not make a sufficiently compelling business case to operationalize any of these ""AI as a service"" services, or the reason was something else or whatever.

That doesn't change the facts themselves. Which is that Google has not operationalized any AI As A Service that is highly visible to consumers and has the kind of mindshare as ChatGpt. You can make excuses like ""they wanted to verify the accuracy"" or ""they wanted to protect their reputation"" etc but those are just excuses. There are standard ways to caveat this kind of stuff - companies would normally call them experimental features or Alpha/Beta features or Google Labs features. And Jesus Christ, they've had a decade to figure this out!

Like i said, i honestly think the blunt truth is that Google makes such a boatload of money from ad sales, it has probably become super difficult for them to see commercial value in any of this stuff as it doesn't give them the same shovel loads of cash right away or even in the near future. So all those business cases usually get shot down and they all become internal skunkworks projects that get hidden away from the public and probably get used in some internal capability department that is used to do stuff like ""silently enhance quality of search results"" or stuff like that.",t3_10vikbb,1675794597.0,5

You'd be surprised at all the amazing feats the human brain alone can achieve, such as creating new neuron connections to compensate for brain damage/loss or being able to reason with language, arbitrary problem, or social dynamic.

Computers will never come close to even mimicking actual intelligence sadly.  To think that an intelligent being can artificially create a ""being"" nearly as smart as itself is already a paradox to begin with.  And to think that an animal as stupid as ""man"" (we are animals, or at least much closer to animal than programmer) can program intelligence is naive.

Humans already have this amazing ""AI ability"", its play.  Whenever you see puppies gnawing at things, or cats striking at string, they are building up a much more sophisticated database than whatever machine will ever achieve.

Nvidia has become a huge banana tree in the jungle (reached a $1 trillion market cap), joining an exclusive club of only a few other giant trees, mostly in the tech forest.  
  
Why has Nvidia grown so much? They've been growing a ton of shiny, attractive bananas (producing high-demand GPUs) that are important for both gaming and artificial intelligence platforms. As more monkeys (consumers) see the value of these bananas, they've been clamoring to get them.  
  
Plus, Nvidia's latest batch of bananas (earnings report) was even bigger and better than what most monkeys expected, which has made this tree even more attractive. Nvidia also predicted it'll grow even more bananas ($11 billion in sales) in the future.  
  
As a result, many other banana trees in the chipmaking part of the jungle have also grown bigger. However, not all trees have been so fortunate. Intel, for instance, has been facing some challenges and hasn't grown as much as others.

2671,jm7h5kh,t1_jm7fro6,"1.	Any sort of parallelized computation is an excellent application for GPUs simply because of their architecture. Neural networks involve a ton of matrix multiplication which is why GPUs are suitable for this task. Nvidia’s main product aside from GPUs is their toolkit that allows you to run code on the GPU. While AMD has a competing solution for their own GPUs it definitely has not picked up as much usage as compared to Nvidia. 
2.	We’re always going to need computer graphics so I don’t think the name will change. We might see more specialized accelerators for doing AI compute (such as TPU) but graphics will always be there.",t3_13vr1zd,1685457719.0,24
2672,jm9ecam,t1_jm7fro6,"> in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'?

The GPU is a parallel computing processor, the point is to give it large chunks of data and run the same (relatively straight forward) operation over each data point all at once instead of one at a time in order, which is how a CPU works. Graphics just happens to be the first major application they were used for, as you need to calculate the color of each individual pixel but the functions for doing so don't really need to worry about what the other pixels are doing.

There are a lot of applications of this kind of computing, and it's only going to get more prevalent as technology advances and gets more data hungry. You also missed physics simulations, which GPUs have been used for for quite a while as well.

> just like 'hard disks' are still names used for hard drives in general, even though SSD has no disks anymore.

I expect the GPU to retain their names, but more specialized parallel processing units to eventually become more common. Crypto mining already has some options that are more purpose built, and I'd expect eventually more focused cards that only support compute shaders and not really the rest of the graphics pipeline to become available, though that might largely just be a difference in firmware, so it might not be worth having multiple models.

Shaders is probably the legacy term that will stick around even if specialized cards get more common. And btw, hard drives is actually a bad example of this, because a ""hard disk drive"" specifically refers to a disk drive - if you're using ""hard disk"" over ""hard drive"" for an SSD, that's just the wrong terminology.",t3_13vr1zd,1685484603.0,1

Unfortunately, all three companies are WAY overvalued right now and buying into any of them is dangerous as F. Trust me, I'd love to buy into all three of them myself. 

I still own some Nvidia, but I'm looking for an exit really soon. I recently sold my AMD because the valuation is getting out of hand and I don't believe it's sustainable.

I don't have a position in MSFT, but I'd love to have one. Problem is, I'm not buying it near it's all-time high. It's gone on a tremendous run, and right now isn't a good time to buy imo.

I still think there's going to be some bad news coming to these markets soon enough. Multiple red days strung together. I'd rather consider buying one of these three then.

Of course, it's tough to sit on the sidelines watching these puppies pop 5 percent every day. But each day that it keeps happening, makes it more likely that it's going to crash in the other direction soon

2700,jm7y033,t1_jm7o863,"I find it ridiculous that you get downvoted lol - probably people don't like mentioning of ETFs in /r/stocks (yes, they exist).

Personally I'm in a very similar situation like yours, even my current profit magin is like yours. Only difference being that I own SMH but they are similar anyway.

After pondering a lot, I decide not to sell, for a few reasons:

1. We who own an ETF with NVDA in it, should have a totally different mindset from people owning NVDA directly. For people who own NVDA it's truly their once in a life time to profit a ton from selling it. If NVDA truly popped, there is a chance that they may never get the same price ever again. For you and I however, the semiconductor sector is here to stay. There is no rush for us to sell it now, as even if NVDA popped, we may still have some profit (although lower) caused by the other holdings.

2. If we sell the ETF, we are not only selling that 10% of Nvidia, but also selling the other 90% of non-Nvidia holdings. We don't know whether AMD or ASML or TSM will have a spike tomorrow or next year, but if you sell the ETF, you will lose the potential gains from the other holdings.

3. My own strategy is to passively DCA and own ETFs on a long term including sector ETFs (like a riskier boglehead), exploiting the strategy of 'time in the market' to the max. I also believe that semiconductor, however volitate the industry is, is a great long-term investment - I believe that even in the event that NVDA becomes the next Intel, the sector is still here to stay. If I decide to sell it now, it will create the first crack in my own strategy and belief, and may even tempt myself to go into riskier endavor. I prefer to have bit more principle and patience. 

4. I have no use of extra cash right now, nor any good idea where to invest the profit anyway.

Finally, in your case, you may have tax problems if you sell too. 

So that's my own thought. Also to consider: people are enthusiastic because they can sell them at 100~200% of profit, so it's way more important for them rather than our measly 25% of profit lol.",t3_13vr1zd,1685464317.0,14

Furthermore, who are Nvidia's customers? Big Tech. Who are the main consumers of Windows OS and Office? Consumers and smaller businesses. 

Now tell me which ones can negotiate better prices in large orders. And which ones cannot. Which ones tend to follow the same economic trends and cut back on investment all at once? Which tend to be much more stable consumers? 

Finally, remember that the PC Market is roughly $3 trillion of spending annually. What about data centers? Last year the entire spending on data centers including services was $70 billion. Furthermore, demand growth for Cloud Compute is down from ~33% to ~20%.

Sure you can, both AMD and Intel has datacenter GPUs.. I'm not sure they are very performant and thus cost effective for most use cases yet though.

You're betting that their earnings yield in years 6-30 make up for that guaranteed underperformance. If you bought a 30 year Treasury today at 4%, you'd then need Nvidia to outperform that yield (relative to volatility) over 30 years.

Even assuming a more forecastable future of the next 5 years, when Nvidia should absolutely boom, you would get 4% in a 5 year Treasury. Nvidia EPS yield won't surpass that even with maximum growth until the 5th year. So you're pricing in guaranteed higher EPS yield after 5 years than 4%

That’s not even technically accurate now. It’s very close though and Nvidia is pricing a lot of it’s products as it were a monopoly which leaves a lot of space e for disruption. What makes you think that won’t change in the next 5 years?

It’s a relatively new field so be 99% that the same player will keep dominating it forever seems strange. After all the barrier for entry is quite low nowadays compared to e.g. the datacenter CPU market back in the 00s or 10s

Trainium which is optimized to train machine learning models and Inferentia which is optimized for inferencing; basically, once your models are trained, inferencing is what allows the model to provide predictions to the client.  

One big issue right now with a lot of AI is that the information you submit is incorporated into their future data set.  This is not a big deal if you're a college kid asking ChatGPT to write your History 101 paper, but it's a disaster if you're a Siri engineer asking ChatGPT to optimize your code and now ChatGPT has the source code to Siri.

Far enough out that the gains on the options will grow exponentially as they get closer to the money.

When they bought DeepMind, Elon Musk started to get nervous about Google having a total AI monopoly, and then he co-founded OpenAI with the idea that at least it would give some sort of competition to Google.

OpenAI has a great public facing LLM with a good UI, but there's so much more to AI in general than just LLM's. Also, Google has plenty of LLM's, just not all of them are public facing, and this wasn't their top priority.

Said it multiple times before and I'll say it again, I think Google is basically trapped in an Innovator's Dilemma with AI when it comes to search engines. Google rakes in an absurd percentage of their profits from ads served via Google Search alone, and the problem for them is adding AI to search risks making it less monetizable (since if you're just asking a chatbot for an answer they can't really serve you ads without making the AI a lot less useful). Hence Google would have been perfectly content to keep their search engine the same and not add Bard or other AI to it if ChatGPT and Microsoft hadn't forced their hand.

3197,jjp2wcg,t1_jjot5b0,"Because Google's forgotten how to launch successful new products, I have so many more reasons but that's the main one. They can have all the AI research they want and it won't matter if they can't make a successful product out of it. We've seen what they do, they launch a new product, keep it on life support for 1-2 years, then shut it down or merge it into another business. The secret sauce, the DNA for successful product launches has just missing from this company and it's terrible to see during this time of rapid change where solid direction and ability to execute is so badly needed. That fiasco of a presentation they gave about their AI a while ago that wiped $100 billion off their market cap is just another demonstration of their organizational incompetence, unacceptable they let that happen to such an important event. Admittedly they haven't really needed to innovate because they've always has their trusty ad monopoly to fall back on, but I'm getting to that part next.

Google lives and dies by their online advertising business, of which search is a huge part. Anything that threatens to disrupt that model is a complete disaster for Google. So even if they do somehow launch a superior AI product and fend off the assault of OpenAi/Microsoft (they're currently far behind with ChatGPT rapidly becoming to AI what Google is to search) they still lose, they would be shooting themselves in the foot by cannibalizing their far more profitable online advertising business.

That's not the point though. OpenAI or even MSFT never intended to entirely take over search from Google. But that's the thing - they don't even need to. They just need to nibble away at a couple of specific use cases and take that away from Google and that itself is a massive issue for Google because it is so deeply invested in search and ad revenue and more importantly, it has a 1.4 trillion dollar marketcap and is still valued as a fairly high growth company.

For example, if even a decent fraction of the corporate world starts to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to create content, search for existing content, use it for analytics and market research - and they can do all that from other platforms like Office and Adobe/Tableau and other SaaS platforms, that's a big issue for Google.

Google invented the transformer that OpenAI based ChatGPT on. So yeah they're way ahead in the game, if not the PR battle. Google's LaMDA makes ChatGPT look like a Speak-n-Spell in comparison. There's two reasons why Google hasn't released this to the wider world:

1. This technology (which very much includes OpenAI's) is ludicrously expensive to train which you must continuously do. If Microsoft rolls this into Bing, they'd have to start charging for it almost immediately and it's not really worth paying for yet unless you're an SEO copywriter or a 9th grade english student. They're already burning through cash to keep it going as it is and it's only a viral curiosity at the moment. 

1. The bigger reason is Google has to figure out how to adapt their business model (providing users with links to info they are looking for in exchange for cash from advertisers) to this new paradigm. Hence the Code Red. All the engineers and business folks have dropped what they're doing and are actively working on implementation. In the meantime, they have a cash volcano to help them get there.

But not here for a variety of reasons.   One is access to infrastructure.  

But we can also see how you are incorrect looking at recent past history.

Take two of the biggest breakthroughs in the last couple of years.  GANs and Transformers.

Both came from Google.  Not some AI guy in his basement.

Can you name one major fundemental breakthrough in the last 5 years that did NOT come from a major company and really did not come from Google?

Just one example?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network

 is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow (Google) and his colleagues (Google) in June 2014.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)

""Transformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain[1] and are increasingly the model of choice for NLP problems""

I use to think like you do.  I had for years thought there would be some breakthrough from some nobody because they were able to just think about the problem differently.   But after watching things the last 10+ years it has become pretty obvious that is not how it is going to work.

Most likely it will come from Google.  If not then Meta or OpenAI would be the next 2 most likely.

I actually hope I am wrong.   I really hope some random person figures out the biggest breakthrough ever with AI.    That it just happens by accident or this person is able to truly think about things differently.   But I think now that is very unlikely.  

I just no longer think that is going to happen.  I give it less than a 10% chance.",t3_10at56y,1673620637.0,4

Google now has 9 different product/services with over a billion daily active users.  Nobody else has the same. 

They come into a new market and win it pretty quickly.   Look at how fast YouTube TV has gone from zero to being the most popular.

It is true that Google also tries a lot of things that do not work.  Stadia for example.

But Alphabet also has the most impressive technology thing I have seen in my lifetime and it is completely based on AI.

Employees without AI assistance will suffer relative to their peers over time.  This is the start of a new era and likely the beginning of the end of our human forms.  Hold onto your butts.",t3_10at56y,1673627922.0,3

That's my biggest problem with it as a search tool. It feels like you need to verify the answers. It could give you the websites it draws from, but in that case you're just back to scoring through them on your own. That makes it pretty useless for anything beyond screwing around with your friends. 

I guess humans also make mistakes, but you're able to rely on certain sources due to their authority. I know Wikipedia's editing process well enough that I can trust it in most circumstances, and I know, for example, that I can usually trust NY Times and other news publications with fact checkers and other verification mechanisms. But I feel like with ChatGPT you have to rely on a dumb algorithm that has been shown to be horribly wrong at times.

3535,j46e6w7,t1_j46bnt2,"There are so many problems with this response. 

1. You have no idea where the AI is getting its information. Half the time it makes things up that aren't even real. There are no citations, and no way to validate if what's it's saying is true (unless you google it)


2. chatGPT information is only as current as the dataset the model was last trained on. Google constantly crawls the web and updates results in realtime. Training a new model is incredibly expensive.


3. Google's responses are targeted based on an enormous amount of information about the searcher. Try asking chatGPT for ""emergency tow truck"", ""pizza delivery in my area"", or ""Xbox controller prices"". You realize pretty quickly that chatGPT and google dont even attempt to solve the same kinds of problems.


4. Google has been working on NL AI for over a decade, and is likely way more advanced than openAI technologically. In fact, a Google researcher recently made headlines when he became convinced that Google's chat bot ""became sentient"".  Even if their models need work, they have access to a much larger data set for training than any other company on earth.


5. Monetization is the key to introducing new tech products at scale. Google earns like $60 billion a year from selling ads,  and has a massive ecosystem of professionals that both advertise with and publish using Google's platform. If there is a business model that works, Google has an enormous advantage in bringing it to market.

You can filter and search and perhaps find your answer. But then you have a follow-up question and you have to start all over again.

1. on the fact chatgpt is built upon google's open source language model released in 2018. Chatgpt is trained on opensource data troves used for AI research while google's is training on that + their proprietary data horde.

The only actual slight success outside of search/ads has been their cloud business and even that only does about 30% what Microsoft's cloud business does... and they still lose money last I looked!  And how does one buy the top robotics companies in the world and then completely fail at it??  Wowzers...",t3_10at56y,1673646824.0,-1

3598,j49bjeh,t1_j48fg4q,"kind of silly to act like Google is a failure because they have failed side ventures. They have $17 Billion of operating profit PER QUARTER. They certainly have organizational issues, but their bread and butter is world-class and they can afford to fuck around a bit as long as they continue to dominate search. Google is the name brand search engine and they have a massive brand and network moat. Bing is a joke and OpenAI has yet to prove itself as a competitor. Could you really replace Google search with ChatGPT in its current form? Absolutely not. The question here is whether or not OpenAI will get people to switch to Bing or a new search engine. Theoretically Bing search could get so much better that people switch from Google en masse, but it's stiff competition. Anything Bing or OpenAI release that genuinely brings value will be copied by Google to satisfy their customers and keep them on their platform.

It's also funny that you mention Google buying Youtube as if there's something wrong with that when your whole position is about MSFT being genius for buying part of Open AI. Maybe a little consistency in your arguments could help?",t3_10at56y,1673660371.0,1
3599,j49tf0c,t1_j49bjeh,"I didn't say they are a blanket failure.  I said that they are a failure at creating anything commercially successful BEYOND their original search/ads business.  Even their cloud biz, which you would think a massive datacenter owning Google would excel at, only does like 1/3 what Microsoft's cloud business does.

The point with YouTube is that Google is incapable of creating it's own successes.  Microsoft has many, many times over.  Google's Stadia (failure) vs Microsoft's Xbox (highly profitable) for instance.  YouTube was one of the very few purchases they've even retained success with rather than destroying the original company's prospects as they usually do.

It's quite telling when Google couldn't even buy up all of the best robotic companies on Earth and turn them into a success... they totally set back our robotics future screwing that up so bad.  Just nuts.  Creating their own success beyond search?  They're like a 95%+ failure rate.  And since their only strength is search, they're in for some serious trouble once Microsoft integrates OpenAI capabilities, all while Google is incompetent at turning their own AI projects or all of their purchased companies (many of them AI related) into successes.",t3_10at56y,1673669023.0,0

Setting that aside, It’s worth acknowledging that Bing has been a massive failure and I just don’t see OpenAI as something that will bring people over from Google Search. ChatGPT can’t even get correct answers on basic math problems. It’s basically just a sophisticated version of the word recommendation engine in your phone’s keyboard. It looks at how people have talked in the past and writes things that look good based on how people have written in the past. It has no idea what it’s saying and consistently shows that it doesn’t understand the meaning of words, it just knows how people use words.",t3_10at56y,1673707490.0,1

Google has done very well with search, but I really think Microsoft has a good chance to catch up and very possibly even pass Google.  Even if they just get 1/3 of their business, that is a massive haul for Microsoft.

ChatGPT is far, far better than you describe, and it's only going to improve when GPT 4 comes out this year.  The shit it can do is absolutely mind blowing.  From simply answering questions to actually doing real work (coding, writing articles, tabulating data, creating a Web site, etc, etc, etc).

In terms of enterprise adoption, how many are still trying to switch over, and for the current adopters, are they trying to cut on cloud costs or will that spending increase. In the long term, I suspect there's a general trend where businesses will require more compute, and that would probably require increased dependency on the cloud. But I feel that at this point it's what everyone expects, and it's already priced into the stock. Plus, I feel that the switch to remote work and the pandemic turbocharged growth in both the cloud and Microsoft's productivity's segment in the past years.

You can blatantly tell that Page and Brin haven't been involved in the search side of Google lately. I have actually stopped Googling certain things, and started using other search engines because the quality of results is so poor. When I Google things now, the first 5 results are ads (making Google money, but not helping me with my search). SEO is so gamed these days that often the next 5 results are not of great quality. Mixed in with those results are often YouTube videos (again, making Google money) that don't necessarily get me what I need.

It might replace some niche use cases, but certainly not all. I think people need to keep in mind that majority of what people search on Google is basic stuff like, ""Facebook"", ""Walmart"", ""what's the weather like today?"". I'm not sure why ChatGPT would be any more useful at pulling a link to the Walmart website or looking up the latest weather forecast.

Whenever I hear someone talk about how ChatGPT is going to disrupt Google they're always focusing on how they couldn't find an answer to some extremely niche query on Google, but found the answer with ChatGPT. For example, the other day I was trying to work out how to do a certain kind of geospatial query in a specific version of MySQL and it was a nightmare trying to find exactly what I wanted from Google. It was there, but what I was looking for was distributed across multiple pages of docs and various Stack Overflow answers. ChatGPT on the other hand just spat out the answer right away after explaining the details of what I needed. I think for programmers or people who need answers to complex questions ChatGPT is a great tool, but for the average Google search ChatGPT isn't all that useful.

I think where Google should be investing is in using AI to detect low quality sites. If Google released some kind of generative AI product of there own that would be cool, but I'd imagine it's use would be limited.",t3_10i2ey2,1674341759.0,92

FB and Google duopoly in ad revenue will eventually come to an end.  A company can't just sit on its laurels forever.  Look at Apple, Amazon, or Tiktok ad revenue growth the past few years.

As a shareholder, its frustrating that Google hires so many ppl, invests in so much RD, but the company feels slow and bureaucratic.

I've used it for my use cases and it works perfectly for the things I've tried to generate.

As much as steps made towards developing AI algorithms, we still most probably use AWS or some form of cloud service to deploy their infra and the OpenAI API for the ""search results"". If we start getting traffic at the scale of Google, they cannot sustain this model because of the increased costs, in terms of infra and API costs. OpenAI, with limited traffic, goes down occasionally when the traffic is too high. When was the last time Google or even Bing returned ""Timed out due to too many requests""? Google already deploys a lot of models, and they have done a whole lot of cost-benefit analysis of training and deploying these models. As a consumer, we see the shiny rock in ChatGPT and think this is a competitor to Google Search. It is not even close to that, frankly.

Companies mentioned in the post such as [you.com](https://you.com) or [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) most probably use the API for search results. As the traffic to these platforms increases, it will not make monetary sense to keep using these APIs.

Let us say ChatGPT is integrated into Bing, how does Microsoft monetize that product? Where do you even insert the ad for the search to make sense? Any search engine today has 2-3 ads before the actual search results start showing up, where do you place these ads if you have a Q&A bot that answers to the questions?

I argue that chatGPT covers maybe 0.1% of search use cases.

And the biggest issue that people forget is cost. The cost of inference (generating an answer) is astronomically larger for chatGPT than it is for Google Search, and chatGPT just gives you one answer. The cost will come down over time, but it will never be as cheap as Google Search queries.

Lastly, chatGPT is generating responses that may or may not be correct and as of right now, there is no way to verify if they are correct (you would need a GOOGLE SEARCH) to verify. Google provides website links (100s of them) which can be cross-referenced and verified.

I'm a project manager with marketing responsibilities at an engineering firm. *I* know what my group does and how it benefits projects, but if I sit down and try to put that in marketing lingo, it's a 2-hour process for one page of copy and still lacks the loftiness that published copy for a website or RFP response needs. With ChatGPT, I can get 90% of the way there in 2-3 queries and then just tweak it a little. Some of the responses I got were so solid I would be happy to use them in client presentations as a brief but surgically-to-the-point introduction of our services to a prospective client.

Also had an annual company survey last week and had to give a grilling comment about something leadership fucked up. I gave my boss a heads-up on what I originally wrote and he completely agreed but suggested I smooth it out like a Harvard debate club linguistic style where you can stab someone in the face without being explicit. Dumped my draft into ChatGPT and asked it to make it more polite but still scathing. It got pretty close on the first try and then I just tweaked it.

Knowing the answer already definitely doesn't mean there isn't value here. I see lots of reasons it could be valuable when you know the answer but need to channel it through a different lens for a specific purpose. Especially for generalists like myself that have to flip between project work, client management, and marketing multiple times every day.

Hell, I asked it to write a script for a marketing video about our niche of engineering services and it gave me an excellent script with cuts and imagery for each scene.

Or sometimes it's a true startup coming out of nowhere while the older players struggle to adapt (Google's own success in taking over search and ads, Netflix and streaming, etc.).

Some industries have a mix of all of that (See Motorola leveraging its radio dominance and inventing the analog cell phone, then successfully transitioning to digital cell phones with hits like the StarTAC and RAZR, before struggling to find its footing a few years after smartphones took over, until it was carved up and its cell phone division sold to Google, then Lenovo).

First mover advantage is just one of many potential advantages, which is why sometimes the first mover doesn't actually win.

Google and OpenAI mostly worked in parallel, but since Transformers became really popular for NLP (and later images as well), and it makes sense for OpenAI to tap into the wider ecosystem. As such, they are indeed using technologies that originated from Google. 

But, what OpenAI is doing is really impressive. They really seem to be pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. ChatGPT is one example, but GPT and Dall-E are others. Perhaps what’s most important is that they’re gaining quite a bit of traction, due to the fact that everyone can use it. Google’s NLP models are a bit different in this regard.

The typical googling process is that you run a query, Google returns 10 pages, you scan the results visually, open a couple of them, and skim through them until you have a general idea of what you wanted to look up form in your head.

AI-powered searching will save you the trouble of searching for the result that has the information you're looking for.

You'll write your query as usual and it will provide an AI-generated response created by summarizing the related content on the Internet, using data collected from many pages. So if you write, I don't know, ""best selling video games in 2019"", it will print out the list directly, instead of just referring you to 3rd-party pages. This is an extremely simple example, but we've already seen that ChatGPL is very capable of responding to users who need inspiration for phrasing an email, CV, et cetera.

In most cases, you'll still need to manually process the result content, but I think if it works for 10% of the cases it's already a game changer.

You're right that there's been a lot of hype about AI in the past few months, but it makes sense from Microsoft's point of view.

ChatGPT doesn’t “get” anything. It “predicts” the next words in its response based on its training data and algorithms. 

Assuming most of the training data are not personal emails from 20 year olds, I would expect chatGPT’s “writing style” to be much more formal (like what you’re likely to see published and used in training data).

Edit: also, your example text of how to email a professor for help is absurd. Amazingly verbose and not at all how humans communicate. A simple “I’m having with x, do you have available office hours (/ TA office hours / additional reading recommendations / etc)” (with appropriate polite intro and outro) is sufficient for conveying the above message.

The advantage that the bot has over a typical student is that it will not make grammatical mistakes or other disorderly errors in communication.

That having been said, going to the other extreme and calling it vaporware isn't a much more nuanced take.

What makes AI normal is exactly what'll keep it profitable. AI has existed in some form going back decades. It has plenty of value in computing, which is only expanding and making its mark on our everyday lives.

Whether its hackers creating new methods of bypassing threat detection and remediation systems, cyber sec professionals creating and using new tools to fight those threats, self driving cars, Patriots shooting down Russian Kinzhal missiles or just more challenging video games, better AI is the product of a worldwide arms race to create better technology and automate the handling of ever increasing data volumes, something the world won't stop needing.

Like I said, I agree the hype is going somewhat crazy. I don't think AI is going to plug us all into the Matrix. A $100B increasing in valuation isn't really justified by a hypothetical $10B revenue increase. A lot of that is irrational exuberance which may come back down to earth eventually. New tech always drives a sort of inflated set of expectations that reality needs to temper.

&nbsp;

So let me try to understand your logic. You think GDX will reach all time high (double the current price assuming that's your cost basis) when global central bank interest rates are pretty much at their highest points in history, with no real signs of heavy cuts until mid 2024 at the earliest. Presumably, you're doing this play because you're bullish gold. However, gold miners are arguably more affected by interest rates moreso than gold itself, and they don't have as high of a correlation with underlying gold price as you might expect.

&nbsp;

If your holding period is a year max and you expect to cash out at 2x (as highly unlikely as that is), the much more preferable way to play this is to buy a GDX call at say strike price 45 or 50 for 1 year expiry.

GPT-3 was developed 3 years ago but only released to the public in the past 6 months. It's safe to assume similar levels of technology have been available to insiders for a bit longer than even that.

* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.
* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.
* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    

I don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen.",t3_13rj7b9,1685039674.0,4

1) 100B is a very huge sum. And even if it happens is insanely low for yesterday's 700B market cap.

2) DCF says that to justify a 700B market cap today with Nvidia's current balance sheet, you're betting Nvidia to have 500B revenue in 2033.

3) Such a revenue requires no less than YoY 25% EPS growth rate for a decade.

4) Even if this all happens, you did nothing but match buying bonds for the same price you bought Nvidia for.

5) You outperformed bonds only after the 11th year.

Thus, if you're a holder, you're betting on many many stars to align: AI having such an insane business, requiring so many GPUs for such a long time, no competition (very tough in tech sector you're only as good as your last product), no manufacturing disruptions, costs and debt staying consistently below growth.

If all of those stars align, ten years from now, you will have beaten buying 400$ or whatever is current Nvidia's price in bonds.

Or, what the degenerate gambler ""investment"" here is, that the price of the stock itself will surge further and you will be unloading it.

But I don't know how else to explain how insane the revenue expectations and how long people are gonna have to hold Nvidia before it will be yielding cash flows and possibly dividends or buybacks to motivate their current market cap.

Then Elon Musk decides to play games with the markets on Twitter, or it turns out a group of banks was lying about the Rating of their mortgages, or some schmuck in the Bahamas is skimming money from everyone, or Putin  farts too close to the nuke button, or......

The time it takes to gather, ingest and prepare data, added to model training time, added to prediction time, means that any form of Neural Network style AI trading will limited to short term scalping or arbitrage, a field that is already dominated by Algos anyway.

What they don't tell you is that the poll was executed on extra stupid German shepherds that regularly eat shit.  And the reference group of what nutritionally deficient means was dormant water bears found in the Arctic.

It's all just nonsense.  But it was all funded by the scat society of northeastern Idaho which is sick of their doctors telling them that eating shit is bad, so now they have data which they sold to click bait producers to recoup their investment while simultaneously getting their doctors off their back and now some other group cites that study and so on and so forth and that becomes the basis for so Artificial Intelligence that has effectively become neutered into artificial stupidity by the basis set under it.

\- Stay informed: Keep up to date on the latest developments in AI and how they may affect the financial industry. This will allow you to make more informed investment decisions.

\- Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. By diversifying your portfolio, you can reduce the impact of any single investment on your overall portfolio performance.

\- Focus on long-term goals: AI may be able to make short-term market predictions, but it is still difficult for it to accurately predict long-term trends. By focusing on your long-term investment goals, you can take a more patient and strategic approach to investing.

\- Seek out advice from experts: There are many financial advisors and investment professionals who can provide valuable insights and guidance for retail investors. Consider seeking out their advice to help you make informed investment decisions.

\- Use AI tools to your advantage: While AI can be a formidable competitor, it can also be a valuable tool for retail investors. There are many AI-powered investing platforms and tools that can help retail investors make more informed investment decisions. (Olive is a great example of AI meant to help retail investors)

People tend to talk about the market as a whole but there are plenty of stocks that did really well this year and there are also some that got delisted.

Highly advanced AI is what they need to do what OP is talking about. If the AI was sophisticated as understanding human herd psychology then we are screwed since they likely would not use that information to game the stock market, but to eliminate humans.

Humans have the added bonus of being self aware and thus can be contrarian to their instincts. Knowing that the AI is relying on humans to act instinctually you could be contrarian with your investing. 

Contrarian investing is an extremely effective strategy for this reason since it forces you to go against human instincts when everyone else is falling victim to them. 

So coming full circle, you will always have people try to beat the market. You will always have people freak out from fear or greed and panic buy or sell. You will always have overvalued or undervalued stocks.

It's everyone for themselves and you are trying to beat the market.

Dilution creates a predictable, calculable, drop in price as more shares become outstanding.

Short interest indicates what kind of volume, in terms of % float, has to happen to close the short positions - not an indication of dilution.  They aren't trying to trick you - they're different things.

Another perspective is their respective effect on market cap.  Change to buy/sell pressure has an effect on market cap.  Dilution does not - the market cap stays the same and price-per-share changes.",t3_zpb2aa,1671494520.0,1
5597,j0wv64u,t1_j0wqroc,"Short selling = price drop = bad, full stop.

That there's buy pressure at the same time doesn't negate that shorts push the price down. Even if they don't succeed, they tried, and they may well have prevented the price from going higher than it would. All other things kept constant, short selling will reduce the price.

Short interest of 10% for 70m shares means there's an extra 7m shares in circulation that people can buy, at least until shorts close their positions. That is, at 10% SI, people can buy 77m shares before running out, even if 7m of them don't have voting rights anymore.

The effect on price isn't as easily calculable as dilution, but it's the same direction.",t3_zpb2aa,1671496509.0,1
5598,j0x5cnj,t1_j0wv64u,"Ugh that's just plain old wrong.  If 7m shares are lent out - the people who lent them out cannot sell the shares they no longer hold, its not just loss of voting rights. So that's still 70m shares outstanding in circulation.  When you borrow $10k from a bank do you really think its creating $10k out of thin air too?

Also price drop = bad is also wrong.  You know, sometimes companies are just shit or won't make as much money as projected.  Thats one of the reasons prices drop - because investors see that a company is failing, won't make a profit (or not as much as projected) and thus by DCF calculations the value drops.  Yes, short sellers pile in at this point because, well, the price is dropping.  You're conflating those two phenomenon and claiming the price is dropping only because of short selling.  Short selling helps the market reach the new, lower, equilibrium faster if the market thinks that's where the equilibrium belongs.

I'm done responding after this because its clear you're going to continue to misunderstand everything just to justify your continued bagholding. I wish you luck that you don't lose too much. I really do.",t3_zpb2aa,1671501150.0,1

Banks making up money is called fractional reserves. They are allowed to lend more than they have. Look it up.

Price drop is bad for investors. Whether it's good for any other reason it's a different argument. Clearly it's good for short sellers, no argument there.

Price can drop for many reasons, of which short selling is one. Never said it was the only reason, but for some reason you prefer to think that I did.

Clearly you're too involved in defending shorts. Limited gains, unlimited potential loss. Sucks to be holding those bags, but I feel no pity for those who claim market efficiency but deep down seek to profit from crashing companies. They don't all deserve it.

I hope shorts lose everything. I sincerely do. I hope they stubbornly stick with it to the end, only to know what it feels like to lose everything, and have others profit from it. I'm not planning to sell until they are all bankrupt.

I will stick to buying, holding, and DRS, until that day. I look forward to buying more shares at a discount.

5616,jazq4pi,t3_11ih555,"It’s really astonishing looking at the comments on this thread. I mean we are still in r/stocks right ? A place were investors should be a bit more savvy. 

1) Being first does not mean you will be the only one or the best in what you do. At this point yes Microsoft came first but we have no clue what Google or even Apple or Meta is planning. MSFT seems to be winning for now until the next player launches something in the search space which could be even bigger or better than what MSFT did. Remember the most notable examples in this are Facebook and Google who both dethroned their competitors almost overnight and they were not even the big companies they are now. 


2) It’s not about the idea but the execution. And I cannot stress that enough. Say Google comes back with a much better AI, returns much better results, has found a smart way to monetize it and is years ahead of OpenAI in terms of engineering. Unless they find a nice way to present it and market it to customers they are doomed to fail. Launching a product is not just about the engineering of the product. There is so much more to it. From marketing to business model to public perception to privacy to customer support and to the product itself of course. Remember Google waves ? An internal tool Google used, much like slack-before slack to communicate? They launched it to public but figured their UX and product execution sucked so they killed it. Later on slack came along and showed them that they had the right idea but the execution was poor.  Do I also need to remind you Betamax vs VHS? One was an engineer marvel the other just had better partnerships and was ticking more boxes for the users. 

3) Google is never going all-in in a product. So far Google is known for killing projects if they see they cannot monetize in the short term. Google’s product cemetery is quite huge . They still work like a VC betting on 100 products to get 1 right so their successful product/cemetery ratio is not that promising. 


All in all, we don’t know how it’s going to end but it’s really weird looking comments like Google has already something or MSFT was there first. No Google does not have anything unless they decide to launch a proper product to the market and find a better product-market fit than the competition.  And yes  MSFT was there first but that does not mean anything as Google might have a very strong comeback.

Literally the main algorithm behind all of Googles search at least originally and definitely making up a large portion of it today is just a distributive indexing algorithm. I amazed at the amount of people thinking that ChatGPT and AI will change search and the function of sites like Bing and Google vastly when they don’t even use it in the first place. Why would you want an AI to process search queries in a similar way such as ChatGPT if you want to find sites with information as opposed to the information itself? I’m guessing Google is hesitant on introducing much AI because outside of advertisements which have already existed for the past 10 years, it is actually really slow and not efficient for the actual search function of bing and google",t3_11ih555,1678040286.0,2

Just because you were working for long doesn't mean you will be successful in the market. 

Google has been working on self-driving car tech since \~2010, it is Tesla that made most money from the self-driving fad.

Google is basically trapped in an Innovator's Dilemma, where they have no incentive to release a product that will cannibalize their highly profitable Search business. Or rather, they didn't have an incentive until OpenAI & Bing forced them to and they realized their search business was going to get disrupted either way no matter what they do.

Bottom line, Google controls so much of the search market that they basically can't win even if they do succeed. AI chatbots are much more resource intensive per query than search, so even if Google utterly crushes ChatGPT & Bing Chat their profits are still likely to take a hit.

Microsoft (& OpenAI) on the other hand can't really lose because they control so little of the search market that success is very easy. If Bing went from the 8% market share they have today to 20% of search & AI Chatbot queries then that would obviously be taken from Google's search market share, and hit Google's ad revenue.",t3_11ih555,1677994889.0,34

If CEOs cared about the long term there wouldn’t be so many layoffs during economic downturns. Companies invested a lot of money and resources in hiring and training those employees, and the moment the markets turn they start with layoffs. And what happens when the market starts going back up? They spend more money and resources to hire and train new people.

Under this scenario and under my settings, I asked a bunch of question to chatgpt which you already saw, and it helped me improve my code without any issue. 

 > That's really even weirder since you said it's small enough to fit in memory. Why is it taking hours?

I have about 50-100k images and they have some predictions stored as RLE string. I need to convert these strings to mask, split the segmentations and convert them to polygon which takes about 0.5-1 sec per image. Downloading predictions is less than .1 second per image. I can parallelize the code and wait 3-4 hours or not parallelize and wait for a day for every dataset I need (then, store them somewhere, like datalake or gcp and never repeat that process again). 

Now, you can ask why are the model predictions not stored as polygon? Again, there is nothing I can do about it. I am paid to work with whatever I have.

Why doesn't my Nest doorbell utilize Google Photos for image recognition? Why does my Nest Hub still mistake my wife when we know that Google has practically the best facial recognition capabilities? Their products are poorly integrated. The Nest Hub is still so slow and nearly unusable. Checking the weather is a hassle, and I won't even begin to talk about the calendar.

Larry and Sergey were no different, they just had the good fortune to be leading during a gold rush where no amount of mismanagement could negate overall positive impact achieved by the engineers. Everybody was excited for anything new they built. But things have been stagnant or even deteriorating rapidly.

Yes, Google, like Microsoft, can afford to throw practically infinite amounts of money at stuff and see what sticks. But while both go toilet diving quite often, I cannot help but wonder whether Google has any strategy beyond just that.

Say what you want, but Satya Nadella is an excellent strategic leader and charismatic speaker. Even with buzzword bingo, he has the crowd and the room. Even if things go wrong all the time, the overall direction remains clear and has been very stable. They are invested in all trends and can rapidly scale at any moment, as evidenced with OpenAI.

5822,jomltjj,t3_14cf062,"I think you are picking on a couple of random bad decisions but completely missing the big picture. I don’t think Pichai’s leadership has been very good, but it has been decent. The company is in a good state, with a rock solid balance sheet and has experienced very decent growth in the last years. Most importantly, its core businesses are still cash cows and well defended, all things considered (AI has not yet impacted its core search offering). And Pichai has taken the AI threat very seriously with the launch of Bard and the strong focus on AI in the last months.

Compare GOOGL with META and that is truly a shitshow - META decided to start burning billions in Zuck’s Metaverse project, exactly at a time when its core business was getting screwed by Apple’s new privacy policy on iOS and a recession was threatening Ad Revenue. Now as a cherry on top, Apple announces a VR set that makes anything Zuck’s has worked on look like it belongs to 10 years ago. I still own META because I think the market over reacted back then but I won’t add at these levels mostly because I don’t trust Zuck to be able to do anything other than copy pasting other social media’s features in Instagram.

Other tech companies that are run by clowns are Netflix and PayPal. The first decided to run a 5 BLN dollar stock buyback program with their stock at ATH, while competition had never been stronger and new content was precious (probably the worst capital allocation of a F500 company ever). The second is just a complete shitshow on so many levels.

So, IMO overall Pichai’s tenure isn’t that bad. I would say he gets a passing grade. The real big issue with his tenure is that he did not manage to truly diversify GOOGL streams of revenue. Which is worrying since AMZN did (AWS, Prime, etc), as did MSFT and AAPL. Google is promising they won’t be depending on Ads for long since 12+ years at this point (they even were the first tech company to talk about moonshots and all that stuff), but today they still are 90%+ dependent on Ads.",t3_14cf062,1687121434.0,2

And Playstation just announce a streaming only handheld.   


Also on the point of latency, local games do have latency between inputs, actual processing and frame generation, and display latency. Of course you have the same type of latency chain on a remote machine, but Geforce now has lower latency than local gaming on Series X (in some cases, likely becuase of Nvdia Reflex) \[[https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-geforce-now-rtx-3080-review-is-cloud-gaming-finally-a-viable-alternative](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-geforce-now-rtx-3080-review-is-cloud-gaming-finally-a-viable-alternative)\].

So I would disagree that it's not viable or has no potential. On the other hand it seems like a growing market. Which is why it surprised me they killed Stadia entirely. Seemed like they could have changed the business model and made it work. The biggest issue as a cloud gaming service I saw was having your license linked to the service, and not being able to bring your existing game library like with Xbox and Geforce.

Quarter ended March 31 

MSFT search and news advertising = 3,045 million.

GOOGL search & other = 40,359 million

youtube ads = 6,693 million

google network = 7,496 million

**google advertising total = 54,548 million**

AMZN advertising services = 9,509 million

META advertising = 28,101 million

AAPL services = 20,907 million. They don't report their ad %. 


So Google search ads are big, but not 29x bigger. It's only 13x bigger than MSFT search and news ad revenue.

Another important piece of the puzzle is growth, as we don't want to know what companies have now, but where their businesses are going.

AMZN ads grew 21%

GOOG search ads grew 2%, the overall ad revenue was flat.

The last piece of the puzzle is that ads is GOOGL's main business while it's one of MSFT's smallest businesses. 

MSFT doesn't need ads, any share they gain is basically a bonus. 

GOOGL's perspective - needs ads to survive, multiple difficult fronts. 
MSFT, META, AMZN and AAPL are competitors for ad money. They are successfully gaining ad revenue faster than GOOGL.

When looking at the perspective of other tech companies:

AAPL's perspective - GOOG and other tech companies are not competing successfully in consumer electronics, even though they also do devices.

MSFT's perspective - there's no good competition vs office however their other businesses are contested

AMZN's perspective - there is strong competition in both IaaS and online retail

META's perspective - same position as GOOG, there is strong competition in advertising.

Until some insider shares what happned, I won't be able to comprehend why they thought resetting the user base from Hangouts to Allo/Duo was a good idea. I had it as my default SMS/Messenger. Hangouts came pre-installed with every Android phone for a time.

Seemed like web based Hangouts was a bridge between the Discord era and the TeamSpeak/Ventrilo era. I remember university professors getting frustrated trying to do conference calls with Skype and using Hangouts. Students seemed to use Hangouts to do group projects. Now it's all Discord. Help family with schoolwork, they tell me Discord. I take a class at the community college, collaboration through Discord rather than the university Canvas.

The problem is they have no follow-through.  They launch a product and then it withers and dies because no one wants to be responsible for maintaining the product because there is no incentive to be that person in the company.  Stadia is the most recent high profile example, and one of the biggest reasons it failed was because Google has directly damaged their brand by killing projects instead of iterating and improving on them (Google Hangouts is a good example).
He's essentially a passenger on a train that was set on the course it is currently on by the founders.  I'm not saying he hasn't had positive contributions to the company, but as CEO he hasn't had a positive impact on Google/AlphaBet's culture, and their revenue streams are not very diverse, which opens them up to greater risk from regulation. (Note that the EU is not planning on fining them, but breaking Google into multiple companies so that they can't 'double dip' with ad pricing and serving, it will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Agree that is not specifically the fault of the CEO, though, but the lack of diversity in revenue streams might hit bite them).

As far as the other companies, Apple and Microsoft constantly innovate, but more importantly their record on product support and maintenance is stellar.  Bing still exists (and thanks to MS investing in OpenAI is actually growing marketshare), whereas if it were a Google product it would have been killed long ago.  Microsoft also has a decently diversified revenue stream (Office/Windows, Cloud, Gaming, Hardware) and are actively pursuing other markets (heavy acquisitions in gaming and now AI).  Apple also has multiple revenue streams (iphones, macs, app store, itunes) and a *clearly* defined vision.  Meta is more focused on ad revenue, but the CEO has a vision and is actively pursuing it, even if most people (including myself) think its not going to work out in the end.

Which brings us back to Google/Alphabet.  They have products everyone uses (Chrome, Android, Maps, G-mail, YouTube, etc.)  We also know they are innovative (Waymo, Deepmind).

For example, ChatGPT doesn't just create fluff; you can tell it to write concisely or summarize very technical information and it does a great job. If you tell it to make more clickbaitey content, then yeah, that's what you'll get.

I think this can mean the humans can spend more time on the more difficult, value-adding parts of journalism. For example, data graphics. One of the strong points of newspapers like TheEconomist, WSJ, NYT, etc., is that they have incredible interactive data visuals. These are no doubt time consuming but can't fully be automated because they require a human's judgement of how to best display data to other humans as well as handling messy datasets. Like coming up with good color themes, how to label individual points, whether to use log scales or not, animating trends over time, adding interactivity. Some [great examples](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) of creating nice visuals here, even for 'simple' plots like scatterplots, or for more complex circular packing lots of cartograms.

They can't give actual use cases, with actual incremental dollar and cents revenues.  So they use vague superlatives.  And they get wildly angry if anyone has any doubts, even as they can't answer to the doubt.

Someone just like you got mad when someone just like me (ok, I'll admit it, it was me) questioned their fawning claims that the ""augmented reality"" demonstrated in the pokemon go treasure hunt would radically change the world before the end of that year.  Every sort of company from soup to toilet paper just needed to whisper ""AR/VR"" to attract religious tech bro acolytes.  

The same religious adherence over blockchain.  Ok, so it can do the same tracking as audits and ledgers already do, so what's the big deal?  ""It's in the cloud, mom!""  Yes, and....?  ""Well, it's distributed.  You can track where your tomato comes from!""  Ok, but I can already do that pretty sufficiently.  Mexico.  Why does that make a drawing of an ape worth billions?  ""Oh psssshhht, you have such a profound lack of understanding!"" (Stomps away)

Same thing when they said to bet your life and life's savings on 5G.  Ok, I said, what is one exciting thing it can do that 4G can't and which will capture the imagination and transform humanity?

market cap was $644 billion

Today market cap is: $385 billion
The reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. 

Europe:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above €45K
source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/
I don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. 

USA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  

At the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  

Current market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.  Again this is a lot more palatable than what I wrote 2 months ago ($13 billion/quarter).",t3_zv1dxh,1671992337.0,68

It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).  
  
It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.

And if the so-called “EV revolution” really catches on and Tesla maintains the best product, even less of these people will factor this into the buying process.

Fauci ended up screwing over minorities and LGBT big time and ended up helping and being proponent of the evil pharma industry. How many people ended up suffering, dying from that ? Thousands ? Tens or hundreds of thousands ?

And that is without going into details what he has done later.

So i would say free speech and ''prosecute Fauci'' are very left leaning positions. Well the left as it used to be before they went far left and also became government mouthpieces.

Who is going to give a fuck about minorities, LGBT and be against evil pharma, the right wing ?",t3_zv1dxh,1672021205.0,-2

 >A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

Are you seriously downplaying the importance of Chrome to Google? Just keeping Google as the default search engine on Chrome is worth many billions a year. Google has paid Mozilla billions to keep Google as the default search engine on FF which has a tiny fraction of the marketshare. We're talking 65% vs 3% marketshare.

Chrome also gives Google the ability to drive browser development decisions, tie user accounts to the browser (and into their walled-garden), control of ChromeOS/Chromecast devices, control of browser privacy tracking decisions and ad blocking capabilities, the list goes on.

""Just a browser"" It's a platform, the 2nd most used platform in the world second only to Android. Do you not understand the importance of controlling the worlds two most used platforms?

As far as Sundar's role in Chrome. Yes, he was Product Manager from inception. Of all people, that makes him the key figure in its growth/success.

>Are you seriously saying that the CEO of a company with $70 Billion in revenue, which calls itself an AI company but fell behind in AI to a company founded in 2015 with a few hundred employees is doing a good job??!!

Fell behind how? OpenAI beat them in releasing something to the public, but Google's AI capabilities are at least on par with OpenAI. Being a massive company, Google is just less likely to release toys like that to the general public. Instead, they are more likely to integrate the capabilities into their existing products which is already happening. OpenAI has wowed the public, but that doesn't mean shit until they turn it into a profitable business that steals marketshare from the giants.

>Are you seriously saying that the CEO of one of the most well funded and brilliant developer talent pools who have created paradigm shifts in computing such as the Google File System which was the inspiration that led to the creation of Hadoop or Google incubated Kubernetes which is like the defacto operating system of the cloud and despite all this the company he's running is 3rd place laggard in Cloud computing is doing a good job?

The race in cloud computing started well before Sundar. GCP has grown at impressive rates under Sundar. Azure's growth is an outlier due to MS's role in the enterprise world. But I'm not sure what you wanted him to do other than go back in time and become CEO earlier so they could beat Amazon/MS to the punch. GFS, Hadoop, and Kubernetes were all released under Larry's leadership. If anything, GCP's lower marketshare is on Larry, not Sundar.

Most of Tesla's sales are Model 3 and Model Y, which are its lowest-priced cars but still quite expensive.  Is there enough market--even accounting for increased popularity of Evs--for Tesla sales to grow that much and still maintain their margins?  That is the analysis I'd like to see.  I am not sure of prices elsewhere, but the cheaper EVs here in Canada like the IONIQ 5 are around $15K cheaper than a Tesla (mid 40K range compared to Tesla low 60K range).  That makes a Tesla about 30% more expensive to buy which is pretty big.  As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.

So one would expect either Tesla's sales to peak as they (and oncoming competition) saturate their market at that price level, or else Tesla needs to start selling a whole lot of cheaper cars which means either serious margin reductions or else cutting costs significantly to keep their margins.

Anyway the demand side including what the competition is doing is what I really want to see in a Tesla analysis. Just asserting that they can sell everything they make and at the same margins for a higher-priced product would need a lot of backing to that argument no matter the industry.",t3_y8sdc4,1666270543.0,23

6696,it2shlx,t3_y8sdc4,RemindMe! 3 years,t3_y8sdc4,1666277893.0,3
6697,it3xpyf,t3_y8sdc4,"About 1 year ago: (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): I had written  “I believe 2023 will tell the tale”.  I think it is still so.  At that time TSLA market cap was about $1.1 Trillion.  And as of right now it is about $644 billion.  Of course some of this is to the macro environment: inflation, higher interest rates, etc.  But some has to do with market not knowing the next 1 to 3 years of Tesla revenue/earnings.   I still think the appetite for expensive cars is fairly finite.  However, what I didn’t anticipate was the IRA: I think this will help Tesla quite a bit.  If Tesla vehicles qualify: it will reduce the cost quite a bit and so demand in the USA will probably not be an issue.  I will address some points as I did 1 year ago:

1) USA: as above: Tesla won’t have issues here: it is just a matter of how much production they can do in Fremont and Austin.  ~~The expensive model y and 3 will be less expensive if they indeed qualify for the whole $7500 credit (because there is some battery component issue??~~  (I am not a tax advisor so please ask tax advisor if Tesla qualifies for $7500 credit or not).  ~~So this is a change of my view.~~  I do still believe people will still buy the Rav-4, CR-V, etc…Also, there is a little more competition with the Mach E and soon made in Tennessee ID4…however, this does kinda’ gets cancelled out by the Ioniq5/EV6 that won’t qualify for the tax credit so the sales of those will decline.  Bolt, Lightning, Rivian, Lucid: they are not going to produce in enough numbers to take away sales from Tesla.  

2)  China: Ok, this is where the issue lies.  The competition is more fierce this year than last year.  Moreso than I had originally thought.  I know many people think that some of these Chinese companies sell a bunch of these EV and not make money: that is true in some; but the giant bear in china is BYD: they will report an $800-$900 million profit in Q3 2022.  Why is this important?  They are able to sell relatively cheaper cars and still be profitable.  The cars that are going to give Tesla some headaches are: BYD Seal and the upcoming BYD sea lion.  The seal has good range, 0-100 km/hr time, and have a lower price than model 3.  Unlike in the USA: people in China have more choices and will cross shop. In the USA:  we can’t cross shop with model 3; and even with model y: the main competitors are: mach E, ID4, but they aren’t all produced in high numbers yet (EV6/ioniq 5 won’t qualify for tax credit right now so I don’t think it is going to compete much).  However in China: there is a lot of production from not just BYD, but also Xpeng, Nio, and many more others.  

3)  Europe: This is a mix bag. Berlin just started.  There is more competition here than before: moreso than USA, but less than China.  Cars such as Renault Megane didn’t exist 1 year ago.  VW, Stellantis, RMN, BMW are still steady with their EV sales.   For Tesla: UK and Germany is still selling Tesla quite well.  But for whatever reason France and Norway: there is some decline in sales Y-O-Y.  Berlin ramping up will answer the question to the demand in France and Norway.  Netherlands: still hasn’t recovered much.  So the biggest market right now for Europe is UK and Germany.   Electric car incentive will decrease in Germany in 2023: I don’t know how much effect it will have?? 

4) Cybertruck: still not out yet.  But this will be a North American vehicle. Too big for Europe

5) So if china demand slows down: tesla can certainly export to other markets: but the other markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (the richest countries in Asia-Australia):  I don’t think the market for Tesla will be as high as Europe.  

6) Market Cap of $644 billion today (was $1.1 trillion 1 year ago):  TSLA will have to gain 70% to get back to 1.1 trillion.  What is the difference then and now?  Then: a lot of low interest money: remember all those SPACS??  ARKK?  A lot of market exuberance and many companies didn’t trade on fundamentals.   So at today’s market cap: if tesla just grows 10% per year in market cap, TSLA be $1.3 trillion in 7 years. And in 7 years the PE will probably be 25.  That is net income of $52 billion per year.  For a car company: this is difficult.   I think all profits combined in all automotive sector ex-tesla is < $50 billion today (this is just a guess: Toyota + VW is about $30 billion)??  Last year I wrote: “at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap. To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???”---This year,  the question is will TSLA make $13 billion/quarter in 7 years????

7)  Again, I will reiterate that capitalism has a way for a product to find the lowest price with a given quality.  Competition creeps up slowly.  Feds have been tightening money supply with higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates and probable upcoming recession may have some effect on Tesla overall sales.  Time will tell.   

8)  I think 2023 will be the year that we will have a lot more answers to many questions: what is the intrinsic demand in Europe/is the demand really softened in France and Norway? Is the demand slowed down in China?  Also, will Tesla cut prices in China (this will affect margins)?  To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?   As of right now, there hasn’t been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory. 

9) My opinion: USA: demand won’t be an issue.  China: demand will soften. Europe: demand will soften but less so than China.  I am excited to see what 2023 brings to Tesla.

Edit: I am really unsure if tesla model y and 3 will qualify for tax credit or not (so I struck that out above).   Regardless, I don't think Tesla will have much demand problem in the USA: mainly due to not enough competitors.",t3_y8sdc4,1666293872.0,4

I am not just looking at the past and extrapolating to the future. Quite the contrary. I am basing all my future numbers on Tesla's factories, the economic environment, expected cost savings from new technologies, economies of scale, labour costs, etc., the upcoming tax incentives in the US, and more.

Comparing the cheapest IONIQ 5 with a Tesla is also very flawed comparison, as legacy OEMs have lots of options that increase the price of a car that are always included in the Tesla. Comparable models are only ~5K EUR apart (went with Euros because the Model Y Standard Range is closest in specs to the IONIQ 5, and it's not available in North-America yet since the Long Range and Performance already have too high demand), and the Tesla still has better specs. After all, there's a reason Tesla is selling 200K+ Model Ys in the US, while Hyundai is only selling 25K, yet wait times for both cars are comparable.

> As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.

Even if this happens, Tesla has pricing power to reduce prices by ~$15K and still make more money per sale than other automakers make from their EVs. And that's not even including the $10K in incentives, $2-3K in battery cost reductions, or further cost reduction from increased economies of scale. And we all know demand increases exponentially with linear price reductions.

There will indeed be some manufacturers that do well and scale production, nevertheless their margins are still vastly lower than Tesla and thus have less flexibility in moving prices. Even so, Tesla is competing with ICE cars, not EV's. There's sufficient amount of markets that still have barely any saturation.

Secondly, as mentioned on the earnings call yesterday, margins would be around 31% without accounting for Berlin and Austin ramping up, once those ramp up and economies of scale manifest Tesla will have enormous flexibility with pricing. This is only considering auto business, while energy has seen record growth this quarter.

I understand your arguments but there's enough prood that this company is recession and competition proof. Especially if FSD will truly be wide released in beta EOY and accepted by regulators next year.",t3_y8sdc4,1666271220.0,0

I don't see any real competition in US/Europe though, since EV demand here is starting to outstrip supply so much it's unreal. Most Western European countries are on course to hit 90% EV sales in 3-5 years. The only companies that can realistically produce that many EVs by then are Tesla and the Chinese companies. They'll own ~50% of the market if not more (6M+ sales per year).

The only point I really disagreed with is point 6. Seems to me like you're making some strange assumptions and reasoning by analogy, instead of simply looking at the net income Tesla will be able to generate and assign a PE to that to get to the market cap. Also, the comparison to car companies is always a silly one, since Tesla is a completely different company. They have way higher margins, make 60 part changes per day to each of their models where others struggle to do that much in a year, their entire factories run on AI powered self-management tools, they already earn ~5% of their automotive revenue from software sales and it's only increasing, and I could keep going on and on.

> To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory? As of right now, there hasn’t been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory.

Tesla can get to at least 5M cars a year with their current factories. Fremont is currently at 600K a year and expected to ramp to 800K over the next few years. Shanghai is at 1M and still expanding. Berlin and Texas are each larger than Shanghai and Fremont combined, and expected to do in the range of 1.5-2M cars when fully ramped.

A bit of both, but mostly the latter. ICE sales are plummeting. EV demand is increasing [(7% of consumers globally wanted to buy an EV in 2020, 12% in 2021, 20% in 2022)](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/cs_cz/topics/automotive-and-transportation/ey-mobility-consumer-index-2022-summary.pdf) exponentially. Most European countries and China are on track to hit 90%+ EVs within 3-5 years. It's a clear S-curve.

Also, there is very few real competition out there, basically just the Chinese and Korean brands. And Tesla and BYD seem to be the only two carmakers capable of scaling production sufficiently to capitalize on increased demand for EVs.

Then unfortunately you read wrong. All Model Ys will qualify (which are the most popular car), and the base Model 3 will too. Together that's 80%+ of all Teslas sold. Also, Tesla just guided all their batteries will qualify for the $45/kWh tax incentive, so that's another $2,250-4,000 cost saving for each car made depending on the model.

I think that's just reasoning by analogy and not based on data. Tesla will definitely sell every car they can make, and they're not growing slower because of economic conditions.

Annual SBC for tesla is suprisingly low, they only granted 3M split adjusted shares in options last year, and SBC has decreased significantly this year.  Stock price and ongoing employee SBC have not significantly affected dilution.

The increase in diluted share count over the last 3 quarters is primarily from the 2018 performance award that hit 3 tranches so far this year.  I don't want to go through all the math or dig through all the stock award plans, but ballpark 3/12\* 300M = 75M shares of dilution from the 3 2018 tranche awards, add 1-2M from employee compensation, subtract off a few million for falling stock price and you get roughly 60M diluted share increase from EOY 2021.",t3_y8sdc4,1666298811.0,6

Actually those were cut because they were leading to problems, and the data shows its become way more reliable since they removed them. They actually might be brining back an much more modern HD version of the radar soon, so it clearly had nothing to do with costs as this will be much more expensive.

> also tesla has no secret tech, the tech is out there in the open, other manufacturers are just slow to adopting it

This is true, but the wrong way of looking at it. Tesla open sourced their pattents because they're innovating so much faster that it doesn't matter. They're making 60 parts changes a day where other OEMs struggle to do that much in 2 years. As long as you're innovating faster than the rest, they can copy you all they like but they'll still be behind. Just the single-piece casting machines will take other OEMs at least 6 years to copy, and that's just their internal targets, which are usually overly optimistic.

> Also Elon himself acknowledged that Hyundai is doing well. Have you looked at Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6?

Yep, Hyundai is definitely doing well. Their only problem (outside of still being roughly as expensive as Tesla with slightly worse specs) is scale and cost. They're making so few cars, and at a cost that doesn't earn them any money on the EVs, that it's difficult to call them competition. Perhaps they can turn this around, but for now that remains to be seen.

Tesla isn’t attracting great talent too like it used to, most of their senior engineers have left for better paying startups with better work culture, which is why you don’t see great improvements in new iterations of their cars.

 >A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

ChatGPT would have to make leaps and bounds in terms looking up information fully and accurately to dethrone Google (maybe ChatGPT-4 will make that leap). 

ChatGPT is great for referencing programming and writing sophisticated descriptions (cover letters). It isn’t a reliable source for accurate information in its current form. 

Also worth noting that Google’s AI/ML team invented the concept of a transformer which is what ChatGPT is. We know Google has Lambda. It wouldn’t be that surprising if Google publicly releases their own version once it’s reliable. Similar to how Instagram could just copy Snapchat stories and maintain their moat.

The problem with financial companies is there is very little margin because there is hyper competition and low barrier to entry. 

When I bought PYPL over a year ago I viewed it as PayPal is the company that you use for online shopping when you don’t want to give your credit card out to every website. I did not see Apple Pay coming as a competitor in this aspect, today I see pay with credit card, pay with PayPal, pay with Apple Pay. Both will satisfy this security concern and I don’t see any advantage to paying with PayPal vs Apple Pay. 

The reason I still hold it is that I don’t think they will decline revenues/profit, they just won’t grow like they used to and a 14 P/FCF isn’t a bad price to pay for them. Plus from what I have heard PayPal charges a high payment processing fee, it’s a good position to be in where the buyer chooses the method and the seller pays the fee, if the seller gets a lot of purchases through PayPal they may be hesitant to switch to a cheaper option.

My best guess is that PayPal stock will go up in the long term. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and mobile payments. PayPal is also investing heavily in new growth areas, such as cryptocurrency and BNPL, which could help the company to maintain its competitive edge.
However, there are some risks that could affect PayPal's stock price in the short term. The company is facing increasing competition from other payment providers, and it is also seeing slower growth in its core e-commerce business. Additionally, PayPal is investing heavily in new growth areas, which could weigh on the company's profitability in the near term.

First and foremost, the growth has just slowed. You’re showing revenue and EPS numbers from 2018, but market is forward looking. 1% user growth and 6% revenue growth? That’s slow for a “growth” company. What’s actually happened is this stock is in limbo. It’s not growing fast enough for growth investors, not cheap enough for value investors. It’s maturing, and it’s usual investors don’t like that. 

The markets concern is that the business getting commoditized. Go to any online check out, you have a credit card option, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google pay, Amazon pay, Square, Afterpay, Zelle…etc etc. So many players (not to mention massive players) in this space offer the exact same thing, with no tangible advantage. In fact, Apple Pay is easiest and the one most people use now. Instead of logging into my PayPal account, I can pay by clicking my lock button twice and using FaceID.

My best guess is that the most likely company to acquire PayPal is Amazon. Amazon is a tech giant with a strong focus on e-commerce. PayPal's payment processing capabilities would allow Amazon to expand its e-commerce offerings and reach new customers. Additionally, PayPal's strong brand and customer base would give Amazon a competitive edge in the global payments market.

Here are some reasons why Amazon might be interested in acquiring PayPal:

* PayPal is a leading player in the global payments market, with over 392 million active accounts. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon a significant increase in market share.
* PayPal has a strong customer base of over 392 million active accounts. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon access to a large and loyal customer base.
* PayPal operates in over 200 countries and territories. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon a global reach.
* PayPal is a profitable company with a strong track record of growth. Acquiring PayPal would improve Amazon's financial performance.

Of course, there are also some risks associated with acquiring PayPal. These risks include:

* High price tag: PayPal is a valuable company, and its acquisition would likely be expensive.
* Integration challenges: Integrating PayPal's operations and systems could be challenging.
* Regulatory scrutiny: Acquiring PayPal could attract regulatory scrutiny.

Overall, the decision of whether or not to acquire PayPal is a complex one. There are both potential benefits and risks associated with the acquisition. Amazon should carefully consider all of these factors before making a decision.",t3_13fmsz4,1683962422.0,2

If you ask Chatbot about the best beaches in Mexico, the program is very good at scraping somebody's travel blog to spit out an answer that's more or less correct. It may even be able to write a Shakespeare-like play by scanning his corpus and ""predicting"" what might make sense within that context.

On one hand I was very impressed by the bot overall. It can already provide an alternative for people who just use Google for cursory information about a topic and it can generate custom boilerplate.  I was also able to get the bot to recommend a design pattern I should use based on a problem I put in the prompt.  The design pattern recommended was not applicable, but I was impressed nonetheless and provided feedback to help it improve.


However, the bot has a lot of filters and it provided very high level answers to my attempts to get it to break down a case study by basically telling me more research would need to be performed.  I agree with your point about critical thinking, an inherent limitation is that the bot can't ""choose"" a solution in an open-ended prompt.  It makes sense when you think about the technology in perspective, so I'm not sure where all the fervor came from.  I guess MBAs are still safe for now.

This is Chatgpt's answer: 

Yes, Warren Buffett is generally considered to be a better investor than Jim Cramer. Buffett is one of the most successful and well-known investors in the world, with a long track record of generating impressive returns for his investors. He is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that owns a diverse portfolio of companies, and has a net worth of over $100 billion.  
  
In contrast, Jim Cramer is a television host and financial analyst who is known for his energetic and sometimes controversial investment advice. While he has a strong following and has achieved some success as an investor, he is not on the same level as Buffett in terms of investment performance and net worth.  
  
Overall, while both Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer are well-known figures in the world of investing, Buffett is widely regarded as the better investor of the two.

That's not a very useful question though. I think it's value is in being an additional tool to help professionals when asking technical questions, not about opinions.

For instance, when I ask it to write me an example program in a badly documented library, it produces a fully buildable example that is much easier to understand than the snippets of code with no context that exist online. When asking it to solve specific novel tasks it has saved me a few hours of Googling and experimenting, which is well worth it.

Netflix offers online streaming and that's also extremely scalable at very little marginal cost per user but very high marginal profit
Amazon makes money through aws, not their retail business, and I think there was a recent Munger interview about Alibaba that summarises the situation well. He said something to the effect of despite all the hype, he forgot that at the end of the day, it's still retail which has terrible margins.

The past decade saw a different innovation, which is mainly compromised of platforms and software. Why? They figured it would be better to use the iPhone (and smartphones) to reach users.

Uber disrupted taxis and eventually the food industry with Uber Eats. Customers ride in decent vehicles and get food/supplies at home. Merchants supply food or items without physical customers. Drivers create their own schedule and work as much (or as little) as they want. 

Covid brought the economy to its knees and Uber played a significant role in minimizing the blow. They employed drivers, while merchants stayed in business and users were able to get food and supplies without exposing to Covid. 

Those are powerful intangibles. While the business model may not be profitable yet, they unlocked untapped value through smartphones. 

As they disrupt other industries, like fleet and logistics, more value will be unlocked. They’ll eventually become more profitable as margins improve and other industries are explored. Not to mention other tech advancements that will bring other sorts of possibilities.

Uber, Zillow were competing with the existing products which were doing relatively good.

Inevitably, there comes a time when they actually not just have to be a profitable business but also pay back the investors.

Doesn’t matter though because they first 50 guys through the door are already flush and the retail investors are bag holders. 

Yell however is slightly different - they’re trash because their business model is actually a negative for businesses and their reputation is in the toilet, both for the consumer and businesses.

It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).

Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

It's not a coincidence that was also a time of rapid adoption and accessible tech use in the office--with a computer on every single desk for the first time.

If Lotus 1-2-3 and Word Perfect can move the needle, then autogenerating reems of usable content, legal analysis and customer support chat conversations will move the needle even more, even if you need the same number of people to check everything over.

There are a lot of implications and concerns. I don't expect utopia. And more than unemployment and social upheaval I wonder what the world will be like in 10 years if large chunks of our very culture are auto-generated then edited by a human. We're already swimming in too much content--what happens when every idiot with a laptop can post reasonable sounding erudite essays about whatever crazy notion they have at 3am?

Human beings are incredibly adept at survival, adapting when it is absolutely necessary. 

The civil war originally started over the rise of industrialism and the war over agriculture. Slavery didn’t become an apparent part of the war (it was always hidden within the context of agriculture- one couldn’t imagine the other) until much later. 

When the manufacturing assembly line was created, everyone was afraid they would be out of jobs forever. The same with a dozen other inventions before and after the rise of mass manufacturing. 

Instead, human beings adapted. Their new reality gave rise to more creativity, which birthed new ideas. The free-time created by machines (computers included) led to more jobs, more inventions and a higher quality of life. 

The same will be true of AI. It will have it’s limitations, like all things. We just don’t know what those are yet. The newly recaptured income from deploying AI will increase development of new projects and ideas. Businesses will expand and with it, so will costs. 

While I think investing in companies that have a vision for their future is wise, an investment based mostly on the use of AI is a bit short-sighted. 

If you listen to Microsoft’s Q1 guidance call it is apparent that Satya had every hope that AI would save the day - but he wasn’t sure that it would. Eventually, the CFO had to cut him off before his doubt and uncertainty in the immediate financial future of the company became contagious. 

AI has a long ways to go before it’s utility can be fully realized, and along side it businesses will be growing and developing new ideas that will change the landscape of our everyday lives.

If there's no moat, then it will be widely available at a low cost which is good for stocks and the S&P 500. It seems like this is an argument for my original thesis.

(Turned out her intestines were twisting and she would have died from it had her mum not kept persisting something else was up) Eventually they take her mum seriously Lads procedure, sorted. 

Fast forward 20 years, she's getting violent sick episodes unable to keep food down, constant vomitting for hours. Multiple episodes. Multiple GP/doctor's visits... 

All stumped .. all stumped... Must be.... Period pains... Stomach bug... 

Not a single doctor or GP over a period of 3 years could even put 2 and 2 together even when we explicitly asked if it could be related ... GUESS WHAT MOTHAFUCKA! her intestines were twisting... like read her fucking notes. I'm an engineer and when something goes wrong do you know what I check first? All the shit that failed last time. 

Doctors are just like everyone else. It always amazes me how doctors put themselves on pedastals when in reality they go learn a bunch of shit, and end up using none of it, or they become a GP and become a glorified gatekeeper of medical care. Most doctors are doing the same as everyone else; looking at the clock waiting for the bell to ring so they can go home. 

I'd have taken any kind of diagnosis for my partner over the bullshit we were fed, it got to the point I just started doing the research myself. Becaus it was clear the trained doctors weren't capable of solving this one. 

I know that this seems very ranty, and I'm not implying this is your fault, but to act like glorified AIs (doctors) can't be replaced by better trained doctors (AIs) is hilarious. You went and learnt a bunch of info, regurgitated it in an exam, got a certificate that calls you a doctor and now you sit and gatekeep medical care by applying basic knowledge to a complex system (a body). Tell me what about that isn't replaceable by an AI? 

And finally, isn't people trying to diagnose their own issues actually what you want anyway? So you really think we can train enough GPs to actually provide decent medical care to a massively growing population? GPs jobs is to stop people going up to hospital with non real issues.

GPT models are not just searching for information in their training data to answer a query, they are generating new outputs based on representations that they've learned from the training process. This enables them to generalize to new tasks and solve new problems that they have not seen before. They can solve complex science problems, physics problems, chemistry problems, do step by step reasoning through complex tasks, generate and suggest new drugs, etcetera.

But to state we shouldn't do something because of a very wishy washy concern that we don't even know or understand to be true.... Vs. Accepting it is coming and begining to prepare for it.... Dunno. Just the way I am. If you think humans won't be involved in the new tech.... Then you have WAY more faith in AI than I do. AI will take way longer than your thinking to come to fruition, along the way it will have revolutionised so many other aspects of life. 

For example. Your just a brick layer, no qualifications, little prospects... Along comes a bit of tech that will optimise the growth of a home vegetable patch, it will produce high quality food without the chance you as a human are going to fuck it up through misuse/management. Now how complex do you think that tech is? It's not. It's a camera, it's probably some servos, a CPU and an internet connection. It really isn't all that AI, it's not wildly expensive and it's not wildly complex. Yet, now with a small garden, maybe even some vertical wall growing spots your able to produce almost all of your own veg for consumption. All of a sudden the need to work a 9-5 is reduced because your basic needs are better serviced than today. 

Point being; there have been many many instances of the exact thing your fear mongering about throughout history. To think this is the only thing that is 'multi-industry *changing*' imo is naive. 

I do think AI replacing basic work roles is a potential problem. I'm just not enough to think that AI will progress so fast that entire workforces are laid off en masse. Society has, and never will operate that rapidly. Look at anything and everything humans have ever made and I think that's enough evidence to back that claim. 

It will start with basic services, service chats, the routine scheduling of 'things'. It will begin to take over Q&A more than it already does it, and humans will forever be fearful of it fucking up and will train and retain people to manage these new systems. The people growing up will begin to work with systems from a younger age and we will have humans that are far more capable of complex interactions with AI related industries while losing more simplistic knowledge of things the AIs now control. The advent of more and more mechanical and electrical systems will require more and more maintenance, instead of an expendible employee (because why does a company care if you die? Other tha profit loss) you'll have machines that require servicing, commissioning and maintaining. All of that could eventually also be done by AIs right? Sure. But that too will take huge amounts of time and resources; even if AIs do half the work.

TLDR: the workforce your worried about being laid off in some short timeframe are far more likely to laid off over a much longer period of time, the working lifetime of a human is like 40-50 years. If it takes 20 years to integrate AI that's half the working life of a singular person. In that timeframe younger generations will already have much different career paths and will be choosing those.

My only issue with Shopify is that I don't know where there target market is really.  As I see it, as someone whose worked in ecommerce for 10 years,  Shopify have 3 types of customer

1. Startup types dropshipping from their bedrooms. Shopify did very well out of this type of customer during the pandemic. My concern with this type is that 90% will fail and then cancel their shopify. The ones that are very successful may want to migrate to a different platform, as even Shopifys top tier plan isn't as cheap as some alternatives. 

2. Small mom n pop companies who want an online presence. I believe many of these will discover that selling online is extremely expensive when you try marketing. So they'll either sell very little or will give up online entirely 

3. Medium size or established small businesses. Many of these won't want to migrate to another platform to save $, but some will.  Shopifys continued success depends on these type of companies not wanting to switch

So, in summary,  my worry about shopify targeting small companies is that most of those companies will fail as they discover that the biggest impediment to selling online isn't having a nice looking store, but nstead huge marketing costs.

I would add free trade agreements to deflationary drivers. The pendulum has swung back the other way, however.  So I would add protectionism, sanctions, and export restrictions to inflationary drivers going forward. Lots of stuff made in Mexico used to be made in the U.S. (NAFTA), for example.

Also a deflationary driver was the drop in the cost of transportation.  Container ships, the rise of cheap air express services, etc.  It facilitated just in time inventory, fresh berries in January, fresh salmon from Alaska, fast fashion from China, etc.  That trend was reversed a year or two ago, but the freight costs and other shipping costs have returned to normal.

There will be a backlash, because people do not like getting poorer. Governments will respond as they always have. Inflation will take off and wipe out all the debt. We will start the cycle over. 

I question your assertion that we have been in a "" deflationary regime from the last 4 decades"".

The real story here is about battery innovation and production.  Suffice to say it's a need that's not going away.  This has been clear for some time.  Industry understands this and massive  investments in  production capacity are under construction right now.  

As that capacity comes online, the cost to produce battery electric vehicles becomes significantly less that traditional vehicles.  The cost to fuel EV's is already significantly less.  The maintenance costs are already significantly less.  

Add to this mix the Russian invasion and Europe will now be paying the early adopter price tag to become energy independent.

Coming to your point about more goods and services being produced - more being produced doesn't equate to inflation. The increase in prices leads to inflation.

But I don't agree with it, because you aren't considering the whole ecosystem.

Scaling battery productions and EV production doesn't happen in isolation from the rest of the world. The raw materials for producing them do not fall from heaven, they are dug out from the earth.

You can make it as efficient as possible, but it still doesn't become a tech company. A tech company can make one product or service only once and sell it many times. If every time you need to make another unit of your product or service, you need to buy raw material, then you aren't a tech company. Your costs go up if the cost of the raw material goes up.

And honestly, if battery and EV production is actually so low cost then governments wouldn't be offering tax breaks/carbon credits to consumers to buy or to companies to produce. Governments when they are doing this, means they are taking on debt in some form or other, you can call it whatever you want.

Then coming to the electricity to charge the EV vehicles. If you truly want it to be green, and be at scale, then definitely current sources of electricity generation cannot be used. So are governments or private investors going to invest in new infrastructure to generate green electricity? And if you use existing sources of electricity, but EV vehicles go at scale, do we have enough infrastructure? And if we don't have enough infrastructure but have a lot of EV vehicles, which would increase demand, don't you think the price of charging your EV goes up?

There's more than meets the eye and it's important to think from where the raw material for batteries would come and from where the electricity to charge the EV's will come once everything is at scale.

Yes.  That is happening now.  They are digging them out.  The battery factories that are being built have already signed contracts for raw materials.

>You can make it as efficient as possible, but it still doesn't become a tech company. A tech company can make one product or service only once and sell it many times. If every time you need to make another unit of your product or service, you need to buy raw material, then you aren't a tech company. Your costs go up if the cost of the raw material goes up.

Ok, so is Apple a tech company?  Or Intel?  They have to buy raw material to produce their products.  The market values Tesla like a high growth tech company, not like Ford and GM.  Markets are forward looking and are usually right about things like this. 

>And honestly, if battery and EV production is actually so low cost then governments wouldn't be offering tax breaks/carbon credits to consumers to buy or to companies to produce. Governments when they are doing this, means they are taking on debt in some form or other, you can call it whatever you want.

I didn't say it was low cost.  I said it would become much lower cost over a relatively short time frame, and if you look at the cost per KWH to produce batteries over the last 10 years, you can see what I mean.  Governments have various reasons for subsidizing EV's, but many EV's are now able to compete on their own without subsidies like Hyundai.  As they get cheaper and cheaper to produce this will accelerate adoption.

And if we don't have enough infrastructure but have a lot of EV vehicles, which would increase demand, don't you think the price of charging your EV goes up?

I don't ""want it to be green"".  I'm trying to look at trends to see what is likely to occur.  Ultimately natural gas will be with us for quite some time.   All we really need for the EV push to be ""green"" is just to continue replacing coal plants with natural gas ones as economics has been doing for some time already.  Long term though we're probably looking at a future of mostly offshore wind / solar/ batteries / nuclear.  

In some areas infrastructure will need upgrading as the market shifts, but we're not talking major changes.  EV charging takes a little more juice than running a big AC system, but it overwhelmingly happens at night when other usage is much lower.  

There's actually quite a huge potential in smart grids communicating with EV's on the local level to shift around charging for the benefit of the grid.",t3_12cmumr,1680766242.0,1

Scalability is important, however.  When Tesla designs a car, they make more money when they sell ten million of those than when they sell 1 million because the design costs can be spread out among ten million vehicles.

Apart from MSFT, all of the others you mentioned will have lower valuations in an inflationary environment, even if they make more money, because scalability will become the issue. For 20 million EV's to sell every year, which is about 30% of global automobile sales, we will have some real problems because the infrastructure isn't available, as yet. The infrastructure spreads across digging out lithium all the way to the electricity generation for charging the EV vehicles. For the infrastructure to scale, more investment a.k.a debt will need to be taken on.

Google have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording ""their precious"".

Though its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.

NVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. 

Same with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. 

my view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.

BTW, I think it is now pretty obvious that Fortune 500 companies are going to adopt LLMs.  They take massive resources to train and to run in production.   Google was so smart to develop the TPUs 8 years ago.  Now with the fourth generation in production and soon to release the fifth.   The TPUs allows Google to have higher margins in the training and running the LLM models.   They are not dependent on Nvidia like all their competitors.

The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.

Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.

Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.

 This is the answer:

There are several industries that stand to benefit significantly from cost savings due to AI advancements. Here are some of the most promising:

1. Healthcare: AI can help reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and predicting patient outcomes.

2. Manufacturing: AI can optimize manufacturing processes by predicting maintenance needs, reducing downtime, and increasing production efficiency.

3. Retail: AI can help retailers optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and personalize customer experiences, leading to increased sales and cost savings.

4. Banking and finance: AI can help banks and financial institutions automate routine tasks, detect fraudulent activity, and optimize investment strategies.

5. Transportation: AI can optimize transportation networks, reduce fuel consumption, and improve logistics, leading to significant cost savings for both shippers and carriers.

Overall, the potential cost savings from AI are significant and span across many industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more industries benefiting from its advancements.",t3_12ua2t5,1682114214.0,2

From a stock picking standpoint, I think we want to concentrate on the very first industries that will be completely transformed by this. I think until speech recognition has been completely solved, this will delay your hypothesis.

Just because something is the future or obvious doesn't mean you will make money investing in it. Companies exposed to AI had an incredible run the last few months already. 

Airlines were no doubt the future since 1930, but they have produced a net negative return for shareholders. After the railway mania in the 1860s, it took 115 years until the net return turned positive for them. 

That doesn't mean that you can't profit from clear trends, but you either have to be very early - or buy companies that will benefit from the trend, but are not the clear picks and shovels.

So they jumped on this ChatGPT for Bing but did not really think through the consequences.

Ultimately search is all about trust.   Nobody is going to use a search engine they can not trust.

Microsoft already had bad branding with Bing.  Now having it return made up answers is only going to further hurt the brand down the road.  Not immediately as there is still a lot of hype with ChatGPT.

But the positive is the fact Bing has almost no market share.  So there is very little to loose.  Google has over 30X more market share

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

BTW, I am a shareholder of MSFT and have been for a very long time.

But what bugs me the most about Microsoft is that they are not inventing or innovating anything.

Browsers they had IE and failed.  They had Edge and failed.  So they just give up and now using Google.   This strategy will never enable you to win!

Phones it is the same story.  They had a phone but gave up and now using Google for their phone.   But not only Android but also Google Play Services!!!   Is that insane?

When Google invested into the TPUs 8 years ago, Microsoft did an FPGA instead of an ASIC.  Again what a short term view.  Now Google has their fourth generation TPUs and working on the fifth and have a HUGE advantage over Microsoft.

""Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records — And We Aren't Surprised""

https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-records

Google got it 8 years ago and Microsoft just did not.  Since Microsoft can't do it themselves like Google they need to buy something.  But what can they buy?

Here is a great article that is dated but so much more true today.

https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/

It is the same story with AI.   Google invents transformers.   Microsoft invests into a company that is using Google fundamental breakthrough.   So Microsoft is two folds away from the actual innovation.

But Alphabet/Google is also producing the most impressive technology thing I have seen and even trumps the rockets landing on the ground.

The department that will suffer the most is R&D, hence, most of these companies are gonna be run like they are on survival mode. They need a sustainable business model to keep afloat, while their cash flows remain positive and a steady increase in revenue to keep their consistent earning growth. 

With AI, it’s not about monetization at this point, it’s about getting in first and taking market share. So picture Facebook in 04, the social media market was in its infancy and Facebook was able to corner the market before it started making a profit through business ads and data sales.

In addition, I think people are not that interested in technology that mimics natural interaction with people - when they search for something they want results that are as accurate and relevant as possible (ideally while also safeguarding their privacy), not a wall of text that tries to mimic what an actual person might write. If ChatGPT can provide that, it might make Microsoft's search engine perform better for most people and this might impct Microsoft's bottom line. If all they can show is some fancy chat like feature's I think people will quickly lose interest - just like with pseudo-AI assistants like Siri.
