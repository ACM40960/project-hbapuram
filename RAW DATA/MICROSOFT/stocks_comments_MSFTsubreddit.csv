When people see DD flared posts they‚Äôre expecting effort. 

I‚Äôm thinking of the uranium post a few months back. The poster looked at the price, and saw it was low. Saw the mines were operating at a loss. That nuclear reactors were being planned in Europe due to the war in Ukraine and wanting to no longer be dependent on Russian oil. 

Gave tickers. Of mining companies, and ETF‚Äôs. Noted which companies sat on big piles of uranium, and which were bound by certain laws making it harder. Said it would be a long term play.

Your post was essentially: 
1. IV not priced in
2. AI so hot right now 
3. My positions

You could‚Äôve tried showing how Microsoft‚Äôs stock has moved when it has unveiled past projects (many of which are now discontinued), and averaged it. Or based hypothetical movement on the investment size Microsoft made, and comparing that to similar sized investments Microsoft made in previous projects and how that changed their price. 

I understand AI is less developed and more new than Uranium mining. But your post was minimal effort.

Without insider trading, you by definition don't have all of the information that the market has, and again, by definition, you can't make truly informed decisions.

Hedge funds, with actual borderline insider trading, with hyper-favorable trading instruments available exclusively to them, with literal floors full of math wizards making $800,000+ a year doing nothing but risk analysis, playing with other peoples money, barely beat the market. 

Actual, for-real, literal inside traders (politicians) who get information months before it goes live and can *actually* change the laws that affect that insider knowledge, only beat the market by like 20% on average.

And because of the Marketing buzzz its gotten yet- its getting a massive influx of users( and data) into its systems, combine this with already available data out there.

MSFT doesnt even care about the negative shit because its a 3rd party service( and they are reaping  the benefits)

I'm struggling to see this play out to be positive revenue for Microsoft (but can totally see the case for it causing revenue lost by Google). It seems that the path to disruption is easy, breaking someone else's business model. Building up your own at that point seems a bit more difficult.

Right now the big problem with these language learning models is that they're not yet reliable/trustworthy. Interfering with the results with premature monetization will jeopardize their position in a critical time for adoption.

The SEO cat and mouse game is going to get really, really weird in the coming years, as some kind of meta adversarial network where competing AIs try to outmaneuver the others, while simultaneously poisoning the well of language data that the models train from. 

So if Bing (or anyone else) starts prioritizing more profitable answers over more accurate answers, the quality of the service won't get to the point where it's actually people's first choice. If the serious searches still go to ""Google Classic,"" and Bing (or any LLM) can't generate enough revenue to cover the cost of a search.

Samsung and Microsoft already saw this play out with Bixby and Cortana. And Amazon is struggling to monetize Alexa. Merely having the default position on a popular physical device doesn't make the service actually competitive.

In my opinion, they are operating under the assumption that they can achieve limitless potential by simply throwing more data and computing power at their system. But this is not considering the fact that it has no concept of truth.   
  
I'm no AI expert, but I do understand why Google's Waymo division isn't worried about Tesla FSD. They recognize that the approach being taken by Tesla is fundamentally flawed, and Google has been a leader in AI development for years so they know what they are talking about. It's clear to me that OpenAI won't disrupt Google anytime soon unless Sam Altman is willing to make some drastic changes.   
  
I believe there needs to be an understanding of where the limitations of OpenAI lie before any real progress can be made. If all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail and without knowing the limits of your hammer it becomes very difficult to create anything useful from it. And if OpenAI doesn't create something useful then it won't stand up against Google or any other tech giant for that matter.   
  
This brings me back to Sam Altman's vision for OpenAI which I fear may be overly optimistic at best, and misguided at worst. He must make adjustments to his original plan if he wants any chance of competing in this space.

*Microsoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3*

**Microsoft's investment into ChatGPT's creator may be the smartest $1 billion ever spent**  
In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion into the nonprofit artificial intelligence research outfit OpenAI, cofounded by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and a group of others just over seven years ago. Financial details of the Microsoft deal weren't disclosed at the time, but MIT Tech Review reported in 2020 that the $1 billion was split between cash and credits for Azure, Microsoft's cloud business.  
Apart from the potential huge ROI, Microsoft's deal only looks smarter as more details emerge. The Information reported that the company would integrate ChatGPT into Bing. As Insider's Emilia David writes, that will potentially end Google's two decades search dominance. Gil Luria, director of research at DA Davidson, an investment bank, wrote in a note that ""Microsoft deserves a premium valuation relative to the market"" with its ""investment in OpenAI as a source of a potential huge upside.""  
""We believe Microsoft's investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside,"" Luria wrote. He added that  ""the unprecedented activity"" in ChatGPT is ""translating to incremental volumes for Azure."" OpenAI expects $1 billion in revenue by 2024, according to Reuters. DA Davidson expects those levels to increase significantly.  
In December 2015, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others announced the formation of non-profit venture OpenAI. The organization stated it would ""freely collaborate"" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. Musk resigned from the board in February 2018.   
In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit when Microsoft announced an investment package of US$1 billion into the company. The company distributed equity to its employees, and OpenAI then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.  
**Elon Musk slams Microsoft**  
Microsoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3, a natural language AI-powered tool made by OpenAI. Elon Musk voiced his discontent on Twitter that OpenAI ‚Äî the AI research firm he helped found ‚Äî is exclusively licensing its famous natural language software GPT-3 to Microsoft. Microsoft announcement was met with dismay on Twitter from users who had thought OpenAI's mission statement was to make technologies like GPT-3 widely available to the public. Elon Musk, who cofounded the company in 2015 as a non-profit AI research body, was among those who criticized the deal.  
  
""This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft,"" he said.

**Microsoft exclusively licenses OpenAI‚Äôs groundbreaking GPT-3**

***Sep 22, 2020***

Microsoft‚Äôs deal with San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research company OpenAI includes an exclusive license on the AI firm‚Äôs groundbreaking GPT-3 language model, an auto-generating text program that‚Äôs emerged as the most sophisticated of its kind in the industry.

Microsoft has been entwined for years with OpenAI through OpenAI‚Äôs use of the Azure cloud computing platform, with Azure being how OpenAI accesses the vast computing resources it needs to train many of its models. Last year, Microsoft made a major $1 billion investment in OpenAI, a deal which now involves being the exclusive licensee for GPT-3. Which raises some interesting questions about how exactly Microsoft has acquired this exclusive license. A Microsoft spokesperson tells The Verge that its exclusive license gives it unique access to the underlying code of GPT-3, which contains technical advancements it hopes to integrate into its products and services.

So, while other companies and researchers may be able to access GPT-3 through OpenAI‚Äôs API, only Microsoft will reap the profits of getting to make use of all the AI advancements that went into making it such a sophisticated program. It‚Äôs not clear what that will look like right now, but what is clear is that Microsoft sees immense value in OpenAI‚Äôs work and likely wants to be the first (and, in this case, only) company to take its largely experimental research work and translate it into real-world product advancements.",t3_108b31n,1673396225.0,1

They changed from their old ways hence why they started succeeding, which was my point.

I can continue my list as well, in detail because I'm not a corporate worshipper despite investing in MSFT for decades:

1. Visio(Cost $1.375 billion), failed as a standalone product and was eventually integrated into Office365

2. Great Plains Software($1.1 billion) and Navision($1.7 billion), both failed as standalone product after acquisition despite being 2 of the top 4 accounting apps on the market of their time. Both shut down and was combined into Microsoft Dynamics GP

3. aQuantive($6 billion), most well known failure outside of Skype. This is Microsoft's answer to Google Ads, I don't think I need to go into details about how it ended up being a complete write off as noted by MSFT.

I can also list down tons of game studios and other products/services that failed. All tech companies have their fair share of failure, my point is that MSFT's best success are acquisitions that they don't touch after purchase. Stop inferring the wrong points.",t3_108b31n,1673390591.0,-2

It was a failure as they forced Hotmail to match Yahoo instead, from MSN Messenger(vs Yahoo messenger) to [MSN games](https://zone.msn.com/en-us/home)(vs Yahoo!

1417,imgns3p,t3_x1fjlg,"I did this type of analysis on MF , but a long time ago, back in the early 2000s.  What I noticed is that all the stocks that made their lists had this nice run, about 20%-40% gain and then they would hit the list.  And at the end of the day, for all the work in following, purchasing, selling, ***and if you 'missed***' one of the picks that did well, you way under-performed the averages. (e.g. they often have 1-2 picks out of the entire port that do very very well and bring the entire average up).

I dropped them after they seemed to become 'corp shills' and it felt like they were just 'searching' for stocks to recommend vs. finding gems or doing any real research.

I'd really love to find a research firm that does deep dive research.  I've followed enough stocks and even been in enough companies that I see what the insiders are doing WAY before the public does.

1464,imed771,t1_imdjp20,"At the risk of coming off as a Fool shill, let me make one comment. I was a member of their RuleBreakers group that picked 2 stocks a month. I was a member back in 2010 and blindly bought whatever they recommended. Results were ‚Äòmeh‚Äô at best. So I dropped them. Restarted with the same RB service later around 2017. But this time I added some additional screens of my own on top of their picks. I did a huge deep dive analysis of all their picks going back 10 years. What I found is that there was a significant correlation in a stocks performance over time to the price of the stock at recommendation. 

I don‚Äôt have the spreadsheet around anymore, but I analyzed their returns based on the price at the time of recommendation.  I know, it seems illogical, but almost all of their picks that were under $40 at recommendation were phenomenal. Something like 15 of 18 were positive, 12 were up over 300%, 4 were over 1000%. I know what you are thinking, market cap should matter more than the stock price‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm only telling you what I found. 

So I started buying only stuff under $40 with rare exceptions I‚Äôd buy something above that price. I didn‚Äôt have a single loser after that, and two that went up over 1000%. The problem is that you might only get 1 out 2 recommendation a year that fall in that under $40 club.

Stanovich argued that these beliefs have no valid evidence and thus might have been an example of dysrationalia.\[1\]:‚Ää503‚Ää Sternberg countered that ""No one has yet conclusively proven any of these beliefs to be false"", so endorsement of the beliefs should not be considered evidence of dysrationalia.\[5\] Stanovich's rebuttal to Sternberg explained that the purpose of the example was to question the epistemic rationality of the process by which people arrived at their unlikely conclusions, a process of evaluating the quality of arguments and evidence for and against each conclusion, not to assume irrationality based on the content of the conclusion alone.\[7\]""

They seem to disregard inertia, move completely silently, and generally feature no flight control surfaces or a visible mechanism of propulsion (or really any indication there is one).

We don't just skip to the conclusion and take it at face value, my friend.  We read the methodology, and think about what was done.

The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms.  It's an extremely artificial definition.  It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors *in general* - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.  All of which should give you pause before making the *additional* conclusion, which the article *does not make*, which is that ""everyone should LSI"".

>And if your argument is that one outperforms the other but some people don't prefer to do it because of psychological reasons that is one hell of a goal post move.

No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that *more* of the people you tell to do this will *lose* than if you had just held your tongue.",t3_13rxgz6,1685139798.0,1

You've done nothing of the sort. You highlighted the one paragraph that had a downside and declared victory like a child. 

>The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms. It's an extremely artificial definition.

What definition wouldn't be extremely artificial? Should Moses walk down from a mountain with the definition carved into tablets by lighting? 

>It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors in general - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.

Again, this is irrelevant to the argument about performance. If your argument is that people shouldn't LSI because psychologically they can't handle then fine, but that is not what you said and it is a pretty obvious end run around the fact that ""statistically speaking"" LSI generates better returns. 

>No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is 

This is the type of argument that would lead you to invest in nothing but treasury bonds.

>the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that more of the people you tell to do this will lose than if you had just held your tongue.

Good point, let's tell them to put in under a mattress. That'll do them good. If your sole goal is minimization of nominal losses you shouldn't be investing into any stock... ever. Is that your proposal? 

>All of which should give you pause before making the additional conclusion, which the article does not make, which is that ""everyone should LSI"".

Generative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.

The whole point is that the race is already here. We're in it. But that's exactly where the danger is. 

If you look in popular fiction like Terminator you will see a General hook up Skynet to all military systems and cause the apocalypse. You think wow that's really dumb why would you do that... But what if AI managed flight plans save billions of dollars or dozens of lives? What if giving AI access to optimize your data center means you will save billions compared to your competitors? If you don't do it your competitor will.

There will always be people who are chasing efficiency and profit wanting to push the boundaries of AI.

The only way out of this arms race is to agree together to be careful. It's exactly like the nuclear non proliferation treaties... not that that has fully prevented countries like North Korea from developing more nukes.

AGI, the thing we are afraid of, is at least an order of magnitude out of reach. There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything ""live and organic and thinking"". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).

AI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain ""skilled labor positions"" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a ""regular"" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.

But if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a ""untrained"" AI.

Western governments will be outsourcing to Palantir based on this war? Wrong. They‚Äôve been heavily involved in western governments from the get go, see above or below. Here is a rand study from 2007 ffs.

>Palantir intelligence analysis software is used by analysts across the intelligence community (IC) to analyze raw intelligence data collected across a variety of sources. Palantir software integrates information from multiple intelligence databases to help intelligence analysts investigate linkages, sort through data, and organize intelligence information. Palantir was privately developed by Palantir Technologies and was procured as a joint urgent operational need (JUON) for forces deployed to OEF. It is used to varying degrees by military members of the IC as an alternative to the Distributed Common Ground Sensor (DCGS) family of intelligence analysis programs, which are programs of record. See Appendix C: Palantir Case Study for details.

More western governments that will be running to outsource to pltr!

I don't feel that it's something that should be easily looked over or just as easily dismissed.

It's like a competition between a comparatively average someone sitting in US mid west eating chips netflix and chillin' vs the person about to make their second ascent on Everest.

While there's nothing really separating the two in terms of technology, the Everest climber would have put in the time, found the right investors, developed the connections, and gained the experience to get there.  

The moat is less technology than it is experience, connections, determination, and culture.

If you compare Palantir as the plucky elementary school kid saying they're going to be a defense contractor someday, 20 years later, they're on the field standing shoulder to shoulder Lockheed, Raytheon, et al.  Anduril is even crazier since they've only been around since Palmer Luckey left Meta/Facebook 7 years ago and benefitting from all the headwork the current leadership gained while working at Palantir.

Palantir braved the headwinds, but they also brought up other companies under their wing.  While I'll agree the SPAC investment problem like WEJO is a huge issue, potentially a job losing event for the finance director that made that call, Palantir is currently profitable, albeit at regular growth vs high growth expected of tech, it does still say that their way of doing business is working.

LLMs are different.  They take tons of resources to train, a massive amount of resources, and this is for one scientist making the initial model.  Then when it's done it can run easily with 10,000x less resources.  But if you have 100k users, already you need 10x the resources.

Open source doesn't tend to host services like Youtube, they create software and the end user can run it on their own hardware.  Because of this, you need around 10,000x more hardware to build the thing than to have users run it.  

If open source wants to do anything LLM then the people doing that need to rent servers on AWS or similar just like the companies do.

Natural languages are polymorphic, meaning the meaning for a word changes based on its context, what it is referring to irl.  Then the only way to translate natural language well is to know the world, so Google set out a new kind of ML to pre-train on Wikipedia articles so it could learn language and then translate better.

AI is very capable of creating original ideas given a seed generation to build on has enough noise to give it a starting point. This is no different than a human taking a random concept and then building on it.

For example, given the AI has enough input on the world, it could make connections and ""ideas"" beyond anything a human may. It could connect the properties of cake icing to causing cancer because of a chemical compound and reviewing the statistics it has to cake fatalities.

Engineers use a litany of tools already to optimize and generate new code for them.

2. Market Analysis: In this section, you should conduct market research to identify your target audience, competitive landscape, and industry trends. You should also discuss any unique selling points that set your ice cream shop apart from competitors.

3. Company Description: This section should provide a more detailed description of your ice cream shop, including the location, store design, and staffing.

4. Services and Products: In this section, you should outline your ice cream shop's products and services, including any unique flavors, toppings, or packaging options.

5. Marketing and Sales: This section should describe your marketing and sales strategy, including how you plan to attract customers, retain them, and increase sales.

6. Operations and Management: In this section, you should describe the daily operations of your ice cream shop, including staff roles, inventory management, and customer service.

7. Financial Projections: This section should provide detailed financial projections, including startup costs, revenue and expense forecasts, and break-even analysis.

8. Funding Request: If you are seeking funding for your ice cream shop, this section should outline the amount of funding you need, how it will be used, and your repayment plan.

Overall, a business plan for an ice cream shop should be comprehensive, detail-oriented, and well-researched to ensure the success of your business.

Because Amazon's existing workforce is heavily male dominated the algorithms the software used decided that male candidates are superior to female candidates, and began rejecting resumes that used the word ""Women's"" anywhere (i.e. ""played on women's volleyball team"" for example), and any resumes from candidates who went to women's only colleges.

another thing is, they can't return the answer as chat gpt. if they will do, they will drastically reduce the visits from their engine to indexed pages.

so it is lose-lose situation for them anyway.

first lose, they can't add the rival AI, because other company produced the product already.

second lose, they can't give the answer right away because they would drastically reduce visits to indexed pages, and business model is based on that that user will visit the pages !!!

so they are in big trouble and they can't do anything with that.

But that‚Äôs what makes it pretty exciting, that a lot of companies have been holding their cards close to their chests.

2762,j7im0wz,t1_j7hv8s5,"I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but I think you're oversimplifying things because you're forgetting two key factors. 

1) Google brings in a huge chunk of it's revenue from running ads on Google Search. It's their biggest profit driver by far.

2) It's very easy to see how these AI's will start to cannibalize the search market in the medium to long term as their accuracy/etc. improves overtime and it becomes a better product.

So basically, even if Google wins the market and crushes ChatGPT and other competitors, they could still end up losing big overall. These factors are even worse when you consider a few other things: 

* It's been stated that each ChatGPT query consumes significantly more resources then a single search engine query (I've seen articles stating that it's as much 60 times the average search query), meaning it's much more expensive to run then a search engine. Odds are very good that anything Google creates will have this problem as well.

* There seem to be much more limited ways of monetizing this technology. Google Search can sell ads to appear at the top of the search results for certain queries, but ChatGPT type products can't really do that so well. And for as long as the market remains competitive the players are going to be especially limited in how many ads they can try to stuff into these AI's. Because if people feel that Bard or ChatGPT are just constantly shilling advertiser's products then they'll go elsewhere.

Bottom line, regardless of who wins in this AI battle, it DOESN'T mean that the winner will be a good investment. A lot of Dotcom bubble companies that won out were still terrible investments that you could have bought into far cheaper after the hype died down.",t3_10vikbb,1675733514.0,9

No, that's just some horseshit they have made up to justify why they haven't released anything. For example, they could have easily released it as a Google Labs thing or as an experimental beta.

The true reason why Google didn't release any AI service yet is because they could not monetize it to billions of dollars. So senior mgmt kept shooting it down as the ""business case"" is not powerful enough.

But now they got massively embarrassed by a startup and have to do damage control. So they went into all hands on deck scramble mode and quickly announced some of this stuff as damage control. That and the fact that ChatGpt is the first service that proves to be a real threat to their cash cow, which is search (and the advertising dollars that ride on it). And has Microsoft's backing and dollars.

So they have to quickly prove that they too can answer complex questions like ChatGpt can so they stay relevant and dominant in the eyes of users.

I've been following AI development and Big Data development for years - that's my line of work. Please read my post more carefully before jumping to wrong conclusions.

Google is undeniably a leader and pioneer in the AI space. And since you brought it up, so was Yahoo in the Big Data space.

Neither am I diminishing stuff like LaMDA.

My point was super simple but you're refusing to see it. I said that for some reason, Google has been unable to bring any breakthrough AI service to the masses the way ChatGpt did.

That's what they have to hide. Now you can argue that it was because their product managers could not make a sufficiently compelling business case to operationalize any of these ""AI as a service"" services, or the reason was something else or whatever.

That doesn't change the facts themselves. Which is that Google has not operationalized any AI As A Service that is highly visible to consumers and has the kind of mindshare as ChatGpt. You can make excuses like ""they wanted to verify the accuracy"" or ""they wanted to protect their reputation"" etc but those are just excuses. There are standard ways to caveat this kind of stuff - companies would normally call them experimental features or Alpha/Beta features or Google Labs features. And Jesus Christ, they've had a decade to figure this out!

Like i said, i honestly think the blunt truth is that Google makes such a boatload of money from ad sales, it has probably become super difficult for them to see commercial value in any of this stuff as it doesn't give them the same shovel loads of cash right away or even in the near future. So all those business cases usually get shot down and they all become internal skunkworks projects that get hidden away from the public and probably get used in some internal capability department that is used to do stuff like ""silently enhance quality of search results"" or stuff like that.",t3_10vikbb,1675794597.0,3
2955,j88yrfq,t1_j87xb4m,"Sounds you are severely underestimating the intelligence of livings beings.

You'd be surprised at all the amazing feats the human brain alone can achieve, such as creating new neuron connections to compensate for brain damage/loss or being able to reason with language, arbitrary problem, or social dynamic.

Computers will never come close to even mimicking actual intelligence sadly.  To think that an intelligent being can artificially create a ""being"" nearly as smart as itself is already a paradox to begin with.  And to think that an animal as stupid as ""man"" (we are animals, or at least much closer to animal than programmer) can program intelligence is naive.

Humans already have this amazing ""AI ability"", its play.  Whenever you see puppies gnawing at things, or cats striking at string, they are building up a much more sophisticated database than whatever machine will ever achieve.

Of course, these things did eventually come true, but they took like 50 years and not 5.

You grow twice as much food with the same amount of labor. In fact, given Open AI's non/capped profit status, Altman's one of the few people that wouldn't get particularly rich off of AI.

Lastly, the housing crisis made a bunch of regular people fabulously rich before the entire market crashed. Americans still think every person should be able to own a home, no matter how broke or uncreditworthy they are. The whole market crashed because Alan Greenspan, Bill Clinton, and the 1990s Republican Congress essentially gave every American subsidized loans to buy houses that they later couldn't pay back. Banks thought housing loans were completely safe, but they were much riskier than anyone thought. No one would have made those loans without those government subsidies in the first place. 

The college debt crisis is exactly the same problem. Bad students got huge loans to go to terrible, expensive college to study useless subjects. Now they can't afford to pay them back. We can frame healthcare as a similar issue where people with average to terrible personal health habits are kept alive much longer than anyone expected due to remarkable, but ultra-expensive advances in medicine.

Anytime you distort the free market with taxes (sticks) or subsidies (carrots) you end up with inefficiencies. The best case scenario is that they quickly blow up in to a huge bubble. The worst case scenario is that they are a massive drag on economic growth for decades.

If you're going to give some a loan to subsidize homeownership, college education, or healthcare, don't bother. Just give them cash and let them decide how they want to spend it. And if someone wants to use that cash in ways you think are bad, that's fine. If they want to drop out of school, do drugs, get fat, and die young, let them. The conditions should be set upfront to get the cash, not after they've already blown it. You should bear the risk, not them.",t3_12hnwvh,1681160643.0,-2

I'm old enough to have witnessed the rise of trickle down economics and it's a flawed idea that goes contrary to human nature. If you let rich people take more, they're not going to spend it on goods and services produced by the rest of us. Rich people don't willingly give away their money.

Plus, Nvidia's latest batch of bananas (earnings report) was even bigger and better than what most monkeys expected, which has made this tree even more attractive. Nvidia also predicted it'll grow even more bananas ($11 billion in sales) in the future.  
  
As a result, many other banana trees in the chipmaking part of the jungle have also grown bigger. However, not all trees have been so fortunate. Intel, for instance, has been facing some challenges and hasn't grown as much as others.

Neural networks involve a ton of matrix multiplication which is why GPUs are suitable for this task. Nvidia‚Äôs main product aside from GPUs is their toolkit that allows you to run code on the GPU. While AMD has a competing solution for their own GPUs it definitely has not picked up as much usage as compared to Nvidia.

3642,jm9ecam,t1_jm7fro6,"> in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'?

The GPU is a parallel computing processor, the point is to give it large chunks of data and run the same (relatively straight forward) operation over each data point all at once instead of one at a time in order, which is how a CPU works. Graphics just happens to be the first major application they were used for, as you need to calculate the color of each individual pixel but the functions for doing so don't really need to worry about what the other pixels are doing.

There are a lot of applications of this kind of computing, and it's only going to get more prevalent as technology advances and gets more data hungry. You also missed physics simulations, which GPUs have been used for for quite a while as well.

> just like 'hard disks' are still names used for hard drives in general, even though SSD has no disks anymore.

I expect the GPU to retain their names, but more specialized parallel processing units to eventually become more common. Crypto mining already has some options that are more purpose built, and I'd expect eventually more focused cards that only support compute shaders and not really the rest of the graphics pipeline to become available, though that might largely just be a difference in firmware, so it might not be worth having multiple models.

Shaders is probably the legacy term that will stick around even if specialized cards get more common. And btw, hard drives is actually a bad example of this, because a ""hard disk drive"" specifically refers to a disk drive - if you're using ""hard disk"" over ""hard drive"" for an SSD, that's just the wrong terminology.",t3_13vr1zd,1685484603.0,1

Unfortunately, all three companies are WAY overvalued right now and buying into any of them is dangerous as F. Trust me, I'd love to buy into all three of them myself. 

I still own some Nvidia, but I'm looking for an exit really soon. I recently sold my AMD because the valuation is getting out of hand and I don't believe it's sustainable.

I don't have a position in MSFT, but I'd love to have one. Problem is, I'm not buying it near it's all-time high. It's gone on a tremendous run, and right now isn't a good time to buy imo.

I still think there's going to be some bad news coming to these markets soon enough. Multiple red days strung together. I'd rather consider buying one of these three then.

Of course, it's tough to sit on the sidelines watching these puppies pop 5 percent every day. But each day that it keeps happening, makes it more likely that it's going to crash in the other direction soon

3670,jm7y033,t1_jm7o863,"I find it ridiculous that you get downvoted lol - probably people don't like mentioning of ETFs in /r/stocks (yes, they exist).

Personally I'm in a very similar situation like yours, even my current profit magin is like yours. Only difference being that I own SMH but they are similar anyway.

After pondering a lot, I decide not to sell, for a few reasons:

1. We who own an ETF with NVDA in it, should have a totally different mindset from people owning NVDA directly. For people who own NVDA it's truly their once in a life time to profit a ton from selling it. If NVDA truly popped, there is a chance that they may never get the same price ever again. For you and I however, the semiconductor sector is here to stay. There is no rush for us to sell it now, as even if NVDA popped, we may still have some profit (although lower) caused by the other holdings.

2. If we sell the ETF, we are not only selling that 10% of Nvidia, but also selling the other 90% of non-Nvidia holdings. We don't know whether AMD or ASML or TSM will have a spike tomorrow or next year, but if you sell the ETF, you will lose the potential gains from the other holdings.

3. My own strategy is to passively DCA and own ETFs on a long term including sector ETFs (like a riskier boglehead), exploiting the strategy of 'time in the market' to the max. I also believe that semiconductor, however volitate the industry is, is a great long-term investment - I believe that even in the event that NVDA becomes the next Intel, the sector is still here to stay. If I decide to sell it now, it will create the first crack in my own strategy and belief, and may even tempt myself to go into riskier endavor. I prefer to have bit more principle and patience. 

4. I have no use of extra cash right now, nor any good idea where to invest the profit anyway.

Finally, in your case, you may have tax problems if you sell too. 

So that's my own thought. Also to consider: people are enthusiastic because they can sell them at 100~200% of profit, so it's way more important for them rather than our measly 25% of profit lol.",t3_13vr1zd,1685464317.0,15

You‚Äôd be betting on a stock that has historically been valued relatively going back to a traditional valuation. Not to say that this is impossible, but Nvidia would likely need to seriously fuck up for this to happen.

Wait for it to fall enough where accumulation actually makes sense, or wait for it to spike high enough that shorting makes sense. Right now, nothing makes sense. In fact, even trying to swing it or daytrade it doesn't make any sense. (reason being, it's too expensive).

That‚Äôs not even technically accurate now. It‚Äôs very close though and Nvidia is pricing a lot of it‚Äôs products as it were a monopoly which leaves a lot of space e for disruption. What makes you think that won‚Äôt change in the next 5 years?

Trainium which is optimized to train machine learning models and Inferentia which is optimized for inferencing; basically, once your models are trained, inferencing is what allows the model to provide predictions to the client.  

One big issue right now with a lot of AI is that the information you submit is incorporated into their future data set.  This is not a big deal if you're a college kid asking ChatGPT to write your History 101 paper, but it's a disaster if you're a Siri engineer asking ChatGPT to optimize your code and now ChatGPT has the source code to Siri.  

I imagine going forward, large companies will maintain their own localized ML training data/models to avoid that sort of data leak.  That means they're going to have to build out their own data centers and it gets expensive!  ChatGPT apparently costs $700k a day to run at about $.36 per question.  I believe they are currently running on nVidia GPUs for both training and inferencing. 

Trainium claims to increase throughput by 30% and Inferentia claims to reduce the cost per inference by 45%.  How they get there, is technically beyond my understanding.

When they bought DeepMind, Elon Musk started to get nervous about Google having a total AI monopoly, and then he co-founded OpenAI with the idea that at least it would give some sort of competition to Google.

OpenAI has a great public facing LLM with a good UI, but there's so much more to AI in general than just LLM's. Also, Google has plenty of LLM's, just not all of them are public facing, and this wasn't their top priority.

Said it multiple times before and I'll say it again, I think Google is basically trapped in an Innovator's Dilemma with AI when it comes to search engines. Google rakes in an absurd percentage of their profits from ads served via Google Search alone, and the problem for them is adding AI to search risks making it less monetizable (since if you're just asking a chatbot for an answer they can't really serve you ads without making the AI a lot less useful). Hence Google would have been perfectly content to keep their search engine the same and not add Bard or other AI to it if ChatGPT and Microsoft hadn't forced their hand.

4169,jjp2wcg,t1_jjot5b0,"Because Google's forgotten how to launch successful new products, I have so many more reasons but that's the main one. They can have all the AI research they want and it won't matter if they can't make a successful product out of it. We've seen what they do, they launch a new product, keep it on life support for 1-2 years, then shut it down or merge it into another business. The secret sauce, the DNA for successful product launches has just missing from this company and it's terrible to see during this time of rapid change where solid direction and ability to execute is so badly needed. That fiasco of a presentation they gave about their AI a while ago that wiped $100 billion off their market cap is just another demonstration of their organizational incompetence, unacceptable they let that happen to such an important event. Admittedly they haven't really needed to innovate because they've always has their trusty ad monopoly to fall back on, but I'm getting to that part next.

Google lives and dies by their online advertising business, of which search is a huge part. Anything that threatens to disrupt that model is a complete disaster for Google. So even if they do somehow launch a superior AI product and fend off the assault of OpenAi/Microsoft (they're currently far behind with ChatGPT rapidly becoming to AI what Google is to search) they still lose, they would be shooting themselves in the foot by cannibalizing their far more profitable online advertising business.

That's not the point though. OpenAI or even MSFT never intended to entirely take over search from Google. But that's the thing - they don't even need to. They just need to nibble away at a couple of specific use cases and take that away from Google and that itself is a massive issue for Google because it is so deeply invested in search and ad revenue and more importantly, it has a 1.4 trillion dollar marketcap and is still valued as a fairly high growth company.

For example, if even a decent fraction of the corporate world starts to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to create content, search for existing content, use it for analytics and market research - and they can do all that from other platforms like Office and Adobe/Tableau and other SaaS platforms, that's a big issue for Google.

This is why Geoffrey Hinton (known as the ""grandfather"" of AI) is talking about how we need all these protections, because a real AGI could potentially be an existential threat to humanity in general.

Of course, there's extremely positive aspects as well, assuming it decides not to kill every human. It'd be like having a real GOD on earth that is helping humanity along, helping solve problems.

Imagine if somewhere in some deep, underground laboratory in a London DeepMind office they have a real AGI.

Google invented the transformer that OpenAI based ChatGPT on. So yeah they're way ahead in the game, if not the PR battle. Google's LaMDA makes ChatGPT look like a Speak-n-Spell in comparison. There's two reasons why Google hasn't released this to the wider world:

1. This technology (which very much includes OpenAI's) is ludicrously expensive to train which you must continuously do. If Microsoft rolls this into Bing, they'd have to start charging for it almost immediately and it's not really worth paying for yet unless you're an SEO copywriter or a 9th grade english student. They're already burning through cash to keep it going as it is and it's only a viral curiosity at the moment. 

1. The bigger reason is Google has to figure out how to adapt their business model (providing users with links to info they are looking for in exchange for cash from advertisers) to this new paradigm. Hence the Code Red. All the engineers and business folks have dropped what they're doing and are actively working on implementation. In the meantime, they have a cash volcano to help them get there.

But not here for a variety of reasons.   One is access to infrastructure.  

But we can also see how you are incorrect looking at recent past history.

Take two of the biggest breakthroughs in the last couple of years.  GANs and Transformers.

Both came from Google.  Not some AI guy in his basement.

Can you name one major fundemental breakthrough in the last 5 years that did NOT come from a major company and really did not come from Google?

Just one example?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network

 is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow (Google) and his colleagues (Google) in June 2014.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)

""Transformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain[1] and are increasingly the model of choice for NLP problems""

I use to think like you do.  I had for years thought there would be some breakthrough from some nobody because they were able to just think about the problem differently.   But after watching things the last 10+ years it has become pretty obvious that is not how it is going to work.

Most likely it will come from Google.  If not then Meta or OpenAI would be the next 2 most likely.

I actually hope I am wrong.   I really hope some random person figures out the biggest breakthrough ever with AI.    That it just happens by accident or this person is able to truly think about things differently.   But I think now that is very unlikely.  

I just no longer think that is going to happen.  I give it less than a 10% chance.",t3_10at56y,1673620637.0,4
4441,j46nw7l,t1_j46n5s0,"> Their product development is complete garbage.

Google now has 9 different product/services with over a billion daily active users.  Nobody else has the same. 

They come into a new market and win it pretty quickly.   Look at how fast YouTube TV has gone from zero to being the most popular.

It is true that Google also tries a lot of things that do not work.  Stadia for example.

But Alphabet also has the most impressive technology thing I have seen in my lifetime and it is completely based on AI.

1. You have no idea where the AI is getting its information. Half the time it makes things up that aren't even real. There are no citations, and no way to validate if what's it's saying is true (unless you google it)


2. chatGPT information is only as current as the dataset the model was last trained on. Google constantly crawls the web and updates results in realtime. Training a new model is incredibly expensive.


3. Google's responses are targeted based on an enormous amount of information about the searcher. Try asking chatGPT for ""emergency tow truck"", ""pizza delivery in my area"", or ""Xbox controller prices"". You realize pretty quickly that chatGPT and google dont even attempt to solve the same kinds of problems.


4. Google has been working on NL AI for over a decade, and is likely way more advanced than openAI technologically. In fact, a Google researcher recently made headlines when he became convinced that Google's chat bot ""became sentient"".  Even if their models need work, they have access to a much larger data set for training than any other company on earth.


5. Monetization is the key to introducing new tech products at scale. Google earns like $60 billion a year from selling ads,  and has a massive ecosystem of professionals that both advertise with and publish using Google's platform. If there is a business model that works, Google has an enormous advantage in bringing it to market.

So the same in Google and you get a bunch of responses that seem like a match but on review are about an unrelated case. Or you get stuff that is years old. You can filter and search and perhaps find your answer. But then you have a follow-up question and you have to start all over again.

1. on the fact chatgpt is built upon google's open source language model released in 2018.

Google is the name brand search engine and they have a massive brand and network moat. Bing is a joke and OpenAI has yet to prove itself as a competitor. Could you really replace Google search with ChatGPT in its current form? Absolutely not. The question here is whether or not OpenAI will get people to switch to Bing or a new search engine. Theoretically Bing search could get so much better that people switch from Google en masse, but it's stiff competition. Anything Bing or OpenAI release that genuinely brings value will be copied by Google to satisfy their customers and keep them on their platform.

It's also funny that you mention Google buying Youtube as if there's something wrong with that when your whole position is about MSFT being genius for buying part of Open AI. Maybe a little consistency in your arguments could help?",t3_10at56y,1673660371.0,1
4572,j49tf0c,t1_j49bjeh,"I didn't say they are a blanket failure.  I said that they are a failure at creating anything commercially successful BEYOND their original search/ads business.  Even their cloud biz, which you would think a massive datacenter owning Google would excel at, only does like 1/3 what Microsoft's cloud business does.

The point with YouTube is that Google is incapable of creating it's own successes.  Microsoft has many, many times over.  Google's Stadia (failure) vs Microsoft's Xbox (highly profitable) for instance.  YouTube was one of the very few purchases they've even retained success with rather than destroying the original company's prospects as they usually do.

It's quite telling when Google couldn't even buy up all of the best robotic companies on Earth and turn them into a success... they totally set back our robotics future screwing that up so bad.  Just nuts.  Creating their own success beyond search?  They're like a 95%+ failure rate.  And since their only strength is search, they're in for some serious trouble once Microsoft integrates OpenAI capabilities, all while Google is incompetent at turning their own AI projects or all of their purchased companies (many of them AI related) into successes.",t3_10at56y,1673669023.0,0

Setting that aside, It‚Äôs worth acknowledging that Bing has been a massive failure and I just don‚Äôt see OpenAI as something that will bring people over from Google Search. ChatGPT can‚Äôt even get correct answers on basic math problems. It‚Äôs basically just a sophisticated version of the word recommendation engine in your phone‚Äôs keyboard. It looks at how people have talked in the past and writes things that look good based on how people have written in the past. It has no idea what it‚Äôs saying and consistently shows that it doesn‚Äôt understand the meaning of words, it just knows how people use words.",t3_10at56y,1673707490.0,1

Google has done very well with search, but I really think Microsoft has a good chance to catch up and very possibly even pass Google.  Even if they just get 1/3 of their business, that is a massive haul for Microsoft.

ChatGPT is far, far better than you describe, and it's only going to improve when GPT 4 comes out this year.  The shit it can do is absolutely mind blowing.  From simply answering questions to actually doing real work (coding, writing articles, tabulating data, creating a Web site, etc, etc, etc).

Take computer programmers for example. They still need a Product Manager who owns the product strategy and proposes a new piece of software. They will need to work with someone who understands the capabilities of software and what is feasible and define the requirements. Then the programmer will most likely use AI to help create the code, but will still need to test and debug the software. Then multiple iterations of this loop as they get feedback from customers etc. 

I see AI making jobs more efficient and effective, not necessarily replacing a bunch of people. AI will help software become even more prolific.

The large language model is nice, but the true power is automation, not having a person in the middle to talk to it. People that are getting excited about the LLM are missing the point of automation.

But it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.

The legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. 

The job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.

That is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.

That being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.

Yes, it's almost 2 Hours - But it's keyed towards Taiwanese commercial buyers, so not a lot of marketing fluff like you see with a new Nvidia gaming card release.

And if you don't get it after watching this, I suggest you go full tilt into NVDA puts - We need someone to help fuel our profits.

For the record, I think almost 90% of the stock market is an overvalued joke that will collapse when student loan payments resume but I'm still dumping $ into NVDA.

Watch the goddamn video. Jensen Huang is literally holding a computer in his hands that can perform 1 Exaflops of calculations.

Does anyone even comprehend how utterly ridiculous that is? That's a BILLION times a BILLION, or for the visually inclined:

**Every time you say, ""One-One Thousand"" the NVDA DGX can perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 mathematical calculations.**

***EVERY SECOND***\*\*.\*\*

Even companies that have zero interest in AI will buy these chips to replace entire Data Centers. You can replace massive, energy consuming supercomputers with NVDA GPU stacks that are a fraction of the size. Less heat, less cooling, less space.

Companies lose billions on heat and space - Why else do you think they keep coming up with crazy ways to solve the heat, space issues.

Whether it's building server farms in frozen tundra's to combat heat buildup, or companies like Google trying to save space by loading servers onto ships that would just float idly off the coast.

Now instead of buying a goddamn barge, loading it with servers, and floating it down the Mississippi Delta, you just call up NVDA and order a compact God-machine that has 300 interconnected GPUS, paired with 144 **TERABYTES** of memory, that you can stuff into a large closet. GG

4742,jnv8gje,t3_146ywtf,"People act as if AI is something new. Computer scientists have been working on this for decades. 

Generative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It‚Äôs a cool new application that people can experience first hand.

But what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?

The reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, they all follow each other. There‚Äôs nothing new about it and it‚Äôs a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.

This is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there‚Äôs an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We‚Äôre seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it‚Äôs only getting started.

Think back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it‚Äôs very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it‚Äôs very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.

To me it‚Äôs a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren‚Äôt realizing that a lot of the crazes we‚Äôve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.

But labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It‚Äôs probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It‚Äôd be like calling the Industrial Revolution ‚Äúa rail bubble‚Äù.",t3_146ywtf,1686546324.0,1

Yes, there are ‚Äúguardrails‚Äù against hallucination, but their effectiveness is way overhyped. Bing Chat, which literally tries to retrieve answers from Bing, ends up making up its sources from time to time. ChatGPT is trained in part using a technique that has humans rate fake responses as ‚Äúbad‚Äù to train the model not to do it - and still makes up stuff. Ditto with Bard.


But the real case against the AI bubble is the fact that businesses are going to somehow be double digit percentages more efficient immediately because ChatGPT exists.

It is estimated as much as 40% of jobs in the US are bullshit and add no value‚Ä¶and now we‚Äôre expecting these businesses to be efficient and utilize these productivity gains? I say ChatGPT (and by extension, GPT-4) and not ‚ÄúAI‚Äù because there really are no competitors at this level. Bard is really not all that good, and all the new generative models made this year are attempts to replicate parts of GPT-4. They‚Äôve added basically nothing other than dumb copycats.

Yes, there are new tools like LangChain, Weaviate, etc. to make using GPT more efficient‚Ä¶but it doesn‚Äôt really change the overall picture.

There was a post in the ChatGPT subreddit where ChatGPT said something like ""1+1=2"" and the human ""corrected"" it, saying 1+1 actually equals 3; the bot apologized and said ""You're right, 1+1 does indeed equal 3,"" or something to that effect.

Similarly, there's a post where the bot insists Queen Elizabeth was still alive and refused to be corrected.

Finally, another post where after a gentle question asking for additional citations of an incorrect claim, since the original citations were from dubious websites, the bots response was testy and it ended the conversation there; something like, ""I provided my sources. You can check them yourself. I don't appreciate your tone and am ending this conversation here.""

I am skeptical the lower hallucinations from GPT3 to 4 are due to any improvement in architecture. I think they just trained it on much more stuff. My go-to example is that ChatGPT3 hallucinated about the Iliad a lot, and was not able to quote from it, while ChatGPT4 gets right most basic questions about the Iliad a lot...but it is also able to quote from it.

I disagree that high level knowledge work is the safest. It will be the actual inverse.

The difference now than previous attempts is that LLMs aren‚Äôt parroting or regurgitating information: the algorithms are learning to infer and deduce with rapid and exponential improvement. Inference and deduction is the core skill that all knowledge work derives its value from. Just like the first computer in the 1950s took an entire floor to be a glorified calculator, these first iterations are massive compute intensive designs that will be refined, made cheaper, and mass distributed over time.

also: isn‚Äôt advanced enough ‚Äúyet‚Äù

that said, I have no idea about Chegg. 7-8 years ago most international students I knew in Canada used local premium essay writers with some awareness of Chinese ESL and a capacity to write believable (from a mainland student in Canada 3-4 years) and very fast (overnight delivery) B+ essays 

the premium was paid for a service 

I would imagine Chegg needs to rely on more than ‚Äòengineering homework help‚Äô but maybe more personalized tutoring or basic product services such as textbook rentals 

i wouldn‚Äôt be especially long in any education services though as i think AI in general is going to reshape how we teach and test students. it‚Äôs hard to offer a service for an environment if you don‚Äôt know how the environment will look in 10 years.

context: i was an essay writer for years a long time ago. made a lot of money on it. knew a few guys that did too and one guy with a company in china that got pretty rich off it. i probably couldn‚Äôt do it now. most of my old consumer segment (rich chinese students) seem to all use chatgpt now.",t3_10v8lvq,1675698805.0,11

To see why, just do the combinations 100 choose 1 + 100 choose 1+... twenty times right.  The chances of that set of numbers in the summation being in the training data goes to zero.  That's why these models can guess two operand sums but start struggling really fast as the number of operands increases.  They don't know how to add.

Yeah, not identical to the new question, but pretty darn close so you can basically just format the answer the same way and get close enough on enough of them to pass.  This generalizes well enough from training to validation data per se... but to go from training to test is another story.  E.g. when I come up with my own super simple logic questions (seating assignment logic puzzles)... ChatGPT fails hard... and they were super super simple ones with just 3 seats.  It's also shit at tic tac toe, a simple solved game where the entire ideal moveset fits in a single XKCD strip.  LLMs are much less impressive than people realize.  They will most likely generate more work than they reduce as people start getting paid to try to 1) distinguish AI from human outputs and 2) to check AI outputs for correctness.

It will become more apparent to you as you use the models more.  You will find yourself spending more and more time checking the model outputs... to the point where it takes more time to check what the model spat out than to just do it right yourself from the start.

How is it supposed to ""strategize"" without being able to solve simple seating problems?  It literally can't.""Do you actually work with them?"" Machine learning models generally, yes.  LLMs in particular, hell no, they're very much not appropriate for what I do.  Not that I don't have colleagues high on the hype train.  They'll come down from it eventually, they're always hyped like that over the newest models and they regularly fail to outperform old techniques in my area.  Freaking XGboost is failing to outperform simple heuristics in my field.  Not on training data, beautiful there, loss heads right for zero.  Not on validation data, you do parameter tuning and you'll find something that generalizes well to that.  But moving to from validation to real world testing in independent data... performance drops below that of the heuristic.  I'm only picking on ChatGPT this much because the hype is so high.  Several of the issues and reasons it isn't going to ""change everything"" are general to ML models, and just modeling in general.  More recent ML models also fail to outperform decades old Markov Chain models on other problems in my field.  And again, yes, they can do it on a data set, and often on an author's chosen validation set, but you take them to the real world on independent data and watch them faceplant.

""Transformational strengths""?  What would those be?  The models are grammatically good and semi-coherent.  I've already said as much previously.

**Baidu (BIDU)** \- I bought calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)

\- I have no idea I just wanted to gamble on China. JD's earnings were pretty good and considering Baidu is the Google of China I might as well risk it for the biscuit

**Crowdstrike CRWD** \- 195c

\- I'm just playing off the fact that PANW had a good earnings. Based on this I might consider playing Okta too depending on how things go for CRWD earnings

**Hewlett Packard HP** \- 30p

Dell bad earnings + NVIDIA sentiment makes me think the same for HP. Also not too sure why but every academic institution & place I worked at uses Dell instead of HP. Pure sentiment play

**CHWY** \- puts, strike price not decided

Petco had terrible earnings so that may not bode well for the rest of the sector

-	RJ is the smartest CEO in the vehicle manufacturing space. Go listen to the ‚ÄúHow I Built This‚Äù podcast to get a sense for his journey to get to where he‚Äôs at. This is the #1 reason I‚Äôm bullish on them. Their first ever vehicle won countless accolades and awards and safety top picks. RJ gets a lot of credit for that, but he doesn‚Äôt crave the attention. He just gets shit done quietly. Dude has his PhD from MIT‚Äôs Auto Design division, and he did it because he knew he‚Äôd need credibility with investors to start a car company. 

-	They don‚Äôt currently have any real competition. They‚Äôre the only three row electric SUV on the market. Truck is after a different market than the F-150. Yes, competition is coming but Rivian just set the bar astronomically high.

-	Rivian has done very little / none demand gen marketing. It‚Äôs all been brand building. They‚Äôre not going to Tesla charging stations and offering test drives. (Ahem‚Ä¶. LCID) Their book of orders and order volume is solid at the moment. They don‚Äôt even have a referral program. Everyone else seems to be scrambling to drive orders.

-	They will eat Subarus lunch. All Subaru had to do was launch an electrified Forester/Outback/Ascent. Instead, we got the abomination that is the solterra. And they‚Äôve not really announced other plans. The R2 line (coming 2025/2026) will be lower priced and squarely targeted at the Crosstrek/Forester Market, presenting the first real competition the Model Y has had. 

-	their costs have been astronomical because they ramped three vehicles to production simultaneously. Doing just one (model 3) nearly bankrupted Tesla. Rivian‚Äôs now sitting on a fantastic foundation, has hella runway, and fantastic vehicles, all without a CEO who is constantly whining and drawing attention to himself in the public sphere.

-	I‚Äôm not seeing anywhere that suggests RJ has sold most of his stock. He bought another 40,000 shares in March of 2022 and Insiders aren‚Äôt buying a ton more, but I can‚Äôt find anything about them selling their shares. Sauce?

Also, cost of goods sold has be 3x their revenue the last three quarters. They have a seriously long road to profitability. They also have negative free cash flow.

At the current rate, they have maybe 15 to 16 more months before they have to consider borrowing money a substantial amount of money. 

I really like RIVN, I'm hoping they find a way to be reduce their cost of goods sold, but I just don't see how they're going to do that without borrowing a ton of money.

- Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from Tesla charging network
- self driving AI isn‚Äôt as far along (it sucks)
- Rivian is ending its delivery van contract with Amazon

These alone are enough to kill it. Apprehension to new electric car adoption is‚Ä¶.lack of range/inability to travel. Tesla fixed this, hence their growing adoption by petroleum fueled drivers. At this stage the consumer just expects to have that access to level of charging capability. Without access to those charging stations is the equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.

In product design and entrepreneurship one rule I‚Äôve heard over and over, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring something to market with incremental improvement. Don‚Äôt even bring 2‚Ä¶3‚Ä¶5x improvement. If you can‚Äôt improve things by 10-15x then no one is going to care.‚Äù And this rings true here. Self driving being on par is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù but no one will care, but‚Ä¶worse than the competition? People will care, and not in a good way. This is shooting your self in your other foot.

Ending the Amazon contract is an awful idea. Why? Social proof. Think about this. I show you a product and you go ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù and I respond with ‚Äúyeah Amazon is using this for their delivery fleet‚Äù I‚Äôd be willing to bet you stop for a second and take another look at what I showed you. I do realize this says ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù but this will get messy because of Amazons investment in the company. To make significant gain they need to end exclusivity and sign a contract with either UPS, FEDEX, DHL, or USPS. The latter runs the risk of being ‚Äútypecast‚Äù like the current mail truck is.

Overall Rivian could (and may need to) pivot into an electric delivery vehicle company and abandon consumer production for now until they get their shit together. Unfortunately they already have vehicles out and this would cause those vehicle prices to plummet. Another option would be to follow the Tesla blueprint - reduce output and create demand. Either way it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road.

Rivian is a shit show internally, all they have managed to do last quarter is fuck with employee morale and cut costs on paper to show they are improving. Cum next quarter you would see they would not be able to manage 20k cars total produced. Yes they might their 50k public target but at what cost? Given that they are in ramp phase, they should be hitting new highs each quarter. Ideally, given the amount they have already burnt building their current factory, i would like to see them hit 75-80k cars produced this year. Their GA factory is a big money pit and any more mistakes made in ramping up the normal factory is just going to jeopardize the GA factory launch timelines.

On the Munroe tear down: first impressions are everything. Overbuild the car to begin with to get all the amazing awards and press. Get pitched as an amazing value (because they cost so much to make). Pare back (as they have been doing regularly - and frustratingly to the aftermarket) over time as failure modes are identified and designs are further refined.

Tesla is still viewed as ‚Äúluxury‚Äù to most folks because that‚Äôs how they launched. If Rivian becomes synonymous with high quality and good value at whatever price point, that‚Äôs a lot better for them in the long run.

If Rivian keeps cash burn at current levels and doesn‚Äôt increase revenue, they‚Äôve 2-3 years of runway yet. If they increase revenue or decrease burn (both I expect to see happen), that runway is a lot longer and gets them to R2.

All the doom and gloom is surprising to me considering that after their initial estimates, they‚Äôve been pretty spot on with targets. Even their ‚Äúmissed‚Äù 25k vehicles last years was within a few hundred, which is impressive all things considered.",t3_13cn3hx,1683645961.0,9

Rivian's AWD beats the crap out of Subarus (I replaced a top-end 2017 Forester XT with a Rivian R1T, so I'm speaking from experience) and their marketing reasons (Dogs, Nature, Inclusivity) are on the same page. 

There's **a** segment of subaru buyers who buy for Reliability - [but Subarus also](https://www.torquenews.com/1084/most-reliable-car-brands-and-why-subaru-only-gets-honorable-mention) [aren't super reliable.](https://repairpal.com/reliability/subaru) Head gaskets going out is kinda a meme at this point.

The Subaru segment is ALSO super interested in sustainability, which is pretty core to Rivian's messaging.

So yeah. I'd wager once the R2 drops, any Crosstrek/Outback/Forester buyers will be cross-shopping that, and I would be shocked if there weren't a significant percentage of potential Ascent buyers also cross-shopping the R1S.

I thought Hyundai had the worst dealership network. But anyways, dealers are just notoriously bad at selling vehicles anyways but I bought my pickup on ford website and the dealer just rubber stamps the transaction, no negotiation needed.

Also, at least there's a network of service locations. There's a particular EV brand that just never seem to get their service centers right. So, there's a flip side to every coin.

how do you figure seeing how Texas has 0% personal income tax and California has a freaking 9.3% personal income tax on $57k of income (which is higher then the highest bracket is high tax states like Maryland).

edit: last guy blocked me after getting a sad last word post in so I can't respond to this thread anymore (though there's a SOLID chance you know that). So by ""tons of articles"" you guys mean ""here's one article where the analysis by Wallethub is so flawed half the article is dedicated to explaining that"". 

Most people making 75k-80k a year aren't going to own a house. If you live in a city you won't own a car. So to the OP redditors are actually MASSIVELY better off in Texas then they would be in California. At least until they start purchasing property (even that's up in the air though cause your own article points out that wallethub didn't take into account how much cheaper homes are in California but who cares that's not the narrative your trying to shove down people's throat).",t3_13cn3hx,1683656559.0,5

7166,j9vt7dr,t3_11b0zz8,"Last week anyone who listened to me on Wayfair puts made money.  This week I‚Äôm buying Kohls (KSS) puts.  The thesis is quite simple.  KSS is buried in inventory.  Freight (both ocean bound and truck) cost an insane amount to get to the warehouse.  Q4 was especially price competitive as most of the industry had too much inventory.  

Q1 has had fire sale prices.  We‚Äôre talking Eddie Bauer, Nike; Adidas apparel for $10-$15.  This leads me to believe that they missed Q4 sales or at the very least Q4 gross margin %.  

As a bonus, this is the first conference call with the new CEO.  I expect him to say that they‚Äôve got to reduce their old inventory to make room for their new strategy giving guidance that Q1 margins will be low. 

Position: Short shares, 3/3 $30 puts, 4/21 $25 puts for the gamblers.  

I don‚Äôt expect a big move like Wayfair‚Äôs, but IV is more reasonable.  KSS isn‚Äôt headed to BK like Wayfair.  They‚Äôve just got a painful inventory and margin problem to work through.  Consensus estimate is an EPS of $0.98.  I expect closer to $0.50 with an outside shot of $0.25 or lower.

Here‚Äôs a variety of subreddits talking about the low prices.  I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any margin here.

7536,ja78fwq,t1_ja5zzea,"Definitely not a slam dunk.  It‚Äôs almost March.  The new CEO could say they‚Äôve made significant progress on reducing inventory in Q1.  We‚Äôve got one more bad quarter, then we expect year over year gross margins to be up 1000 bps due to lower freight costs and improved inventory levels.  We‚Äôre also going to explore unlocking billions of dollars in cash by selling and leasing back our real estate.  We‚Äôll use that cash to buyback 25% of shares outstanding and pay off the debt maturing 2023-2025. 

It‚Äôs not what I think will happen, but it might be what I‚Äôd say as the CEO on my first call with a new company.",t3_11b0zz8,1677494496.0,3
7537,j9ysnsx,t1_j9wqfp3,"I think we‚Äôll see  net income fall considerably short of expectations.  KSS is drowning in inventory and will have discounted to razor thin margins.  I also think their CEO and board of directors installed by Macellum Capital doesn‚Äôtmind if they tank the share price while they clear out inventory.

Macellum tried to get the company to sell out to private equity.  The board of directors fought it off.  Macellum got directors added to the board and brought in their own CEO.  Since then, they‚Äôve borrowed to buy back shares and paid out almost all of the profits as dividends.  The share price has fallen 50%.

I think they‚Äôll continue to make moves that drop the share price but clean up the inventory.  Then they‚Äôll make a bid to take the company private.  With their board seats and CEO, they‚Äôll get it approved.  Once private, they‚Äôll do a sale and lease back of the real estate.  The cash generated will have paid for the acquisition.  They‚Äôll cut costs, let the high interest 2025 debt mature, and sell down inventory.  Then with improved metrics, they‚Äôll bring the company back public and pocket the entire IPO as profit.  After cost cutting, the new lean company will be vulnerable to whatever tough market is next.  They‚Äôll hit a bump and be unable to service debt, but Macellum won‚Äôt care because they‚Äôll have already banked billions.

Even finance like goldman are cutting jobs and I am pretty sure cutting high paying jobs are bad for recruiters and stuff like workday because those high paying jobs pays the highest commissions.  Plus the jobs reports includes gig economy workers so uber, doordash and that stuff are all considered jobs. Workday does not make money from these jobs, they make money from big tech and white collar jobs which is def struggling.

I'm not sure why ChatGPT would be any more useful at pulling a link to the Walmart website or looking up the latest weather forecast.

Whenever I hear someone talk about how ChatGPT is going to disrupt Google they're always focusing on how they couldn't find an answer to some extremely niche query on Google, but found the answer with ChatGPT. For example, the other day I was trying to work out how to do a certain kind of geospatial query in a specific version of MySQL and it was a nightmare trying to find exactly what I wanted from Google. It was there, but what I was looking for was distributed across multiple pages of docs and various Stack Overflow answers. ChatGPT on the other hand just spat out the answer right away after explaining the details of what I needed. I think for programmers or people who need answers to complex questions ChatGPT is a great tool, but for the average Google search ChatGPT isn't all that useful.

I've used it for my use cases and it works perfectly for the things I've tried to generate.

As much as steps made towards developing AI algorithms, we still most probably use AWS or some form of cloud service to deploy their infra and the OpenAI API for the ""search results"". If we start getting traffic at the scale of Google, they cannot sustain this model because of the increased costs, in terms of infra and API costs. OpenAI, with limited traffic, goes down occasionally when the traffic is too high. When was the last time Google or even Bing returned ""Timed out due to too many requests""? Google already deploys a lot of models, and they have done a whole lot of cost-benefit analysis of training and deploying these models. As a consumer, we see the shiny rock in ChatGPT and think this is a competitor to Google Search. It is not even close to that, frankly.

Companies mentioned in the post such as [you.com](https://you.com) or [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) most probably use the API for search results. As the traffic to these platforms increases, it will not make monetary sense to keep using these APIs.

Let us say ChatGPT is integrated into Bing, how does Microsoft monetize that product? Where do you even insert the ad for the search to make sense? Any search engine today has 2-3 ads before the actual search results start showing up, where do you place these ads if you have a Q&A bot that answers to the questions?

What chatGPT can't do is index the entire internet's worth of websites in fractions of a second. It can't telp you the weather, or the current score of a sports match. It can't find you links to research papers, or directions from one place to another.

I argue that chatGPT covers maybe 0.1% of search use cases.

And the biggest issue that people forget is cost. The cost of inference (generating an answer) is astronomically larger for chatGPT than it is for Google Search, and chatGPT just gives you one answer. The cost will come down over time, but it will never be as cheap as Google Search queries.

Lastly, chatGPT is generating responses that may or may not be correct and as of right now, there is no way to verify if they are correct (you would need a GOOGLE SEARCH) to verify. Google provides website links (100s of them) which can be cross-referenced and verified.

With ChatGPT, I can get 90% of the way there in 2-3 queries and then just tweak it a little. Some of the responses I got were so solid I would be happy to use them in client presentations as a brief but surgically-to-the-point introduction of our services to a prospective client.

Also had an annual company survey last week and had to give a grilling comment about something leadership fucked up. I gave my boss a heads-up on what I originally wrote and he completely agreed but suggested I smooth it out like a Harvard debate club linguistic style where you can stab someone in the face without being explicit. Dumped my draft into ChatGPT and asked it to make it more polite but still scathing. It got pretty close on the first try and then I just tweaked it.

Knowing the answer already definitely doesn't mean there isn't value here. I see lots of reasons it could be valuable when you know the answer but need to channel it through a different lens for a specific purpose. Especially for generalists like myself that have to flip between project work, client management, and marketing multiple times every day.

Hell, I asked it to write a script for a marketing video about our niche of engineering services and it gave me an excellent script with cuts and imagery for each scene.

Or sometimes it's a true startup coming out of nowhere while the older players struggle to adapt (Google's own success in taking over search and ads, Netflix and streaming, etc.).

Some industries have a mix of all of that (See Motorola leveraging its radio dominance and inventing the analog cell phone, then successfully transitioning to digital cell phones with hits like the StarTAC and RAZR, before struggling to find its footing a few years after smartphones took over, until it was carved up and its cell phone division sold to Google, then Lenovo).

Google and OpenAI mostly worked in parallel, but since Transformers became really popular for NLP (and later images as well), and it makes sense for OpenAI to tap into the wider ecosystem. As such, they are indeed using technologies that originated from Google. 

But, what OpenAI is doing is really impressive. They really seem to be pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. ChatGPT is one example, but GPT and Dall-E are others. Perhaps what‚Äôs most important is that they‚Äôre gaining quite a bit of traction, due to the fact that everyone can use it. Google‚Äôs NLP models are a bit different in this regard.

It‚Äôs classifying text with sentiment. Models have existed for this for over a decade. And what exactly is said, ‚Äústatistical relationship?‚Äù There are many potentially misleading results by vague ‚Äústatistical relationships.‚Äù 

Also, how are they controlling for leakage? They‚Äôre training and testing it on past data with outcomes that already came within its own data set.

How does it compare to existing sentiment model performance?

Maybe there is something to it. Here is the quote:

> I can make an educated guess that the market reaction was negative, as investors may have expected a more aggressive rate hike to combat inflation or a more dovish stance to support growth. A higher federal funds rate means higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could dampen economic activity and earnings. A lower demand for bonds could also lower their prices and raise their yields, which could affect other interest rates and asset prices. A negative market reaction could also reflect a loss of confidence in the Fed‚Äôs ability to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

It‚Äôs more like a large sweatshop full of trillions of kindergarteners with mounds of magazine and newspaper clippings. They you ask them to produce some coherent text based on your prompt and track which ones are most productive. None of them can really read, but some can come close. You cull the worst and keep the best. Sometimes you might reintroduce a random new kindergartener so the output doesn‚Äôt become repetitive. Sometimes you randomly fill a good kindergartner for the same reason. To help them along you ensure the clippings have puzzle piece ends so only certain ones can follow certain others just as clues. 

Eventually you get to a point where you can ask them questions and they‚Äôll stick glue a bunch of words on a piece of paper as they pass it around in their stochastic manner and out the other end comes something approximately similar.",t3_12qjpgl,1681921767.0,1

8424,jgsxhbz,t1_jgr5a71,"Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has suggested that options trading is contributing to rising inflation in the U.S. economy. Powell cited excessive speculation and volatility resulting from the widespread use of options, particularly in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, as a key factor driving higher prices for goods and services. He hinted at the possibility of more rate hikes to address inflationary pressures.

In an unconventional move, Powell also announced that the Federal Reserve will be partnering with ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, to provide insights and recommendations on monetary policy to counter the looming recession. While some see this as an innovative approach, concerns have been raised about the accuracy and biases of ChatGPT's predictions, as well as the potential lack of human judgment in policy decisions. Rumors of Nancy Pelosi's alleged purchase of ChatGPT shares have also raised concerns about conflicts of interest.

As the U.S. economy continues to face challenges, Powell's remarks and the Federal Reserve's collaboration with ChatGPT have generated both optimism and skepticism about the use of artificial intelligence in shaping monetary policy and addressing economic issues. The implications of these developments will likely be a subject of ongoing debate among economists and policymakers.

8430,jgt6qxh,t1_jgssn3h,"Me:I'd like to give you 5 financial news headlines. Then, based on your analysis of these headlines, can you tell me if you are bearish or bullish on the market?

ChatGPT: Sure, I can certainly analyze the financial news headlines and provide my outlook on the market. Please provide me with the headlines.

Me: 1. Elon Musk says Twitter had many employees but little product development

2. Apple partners with Goldman Sachs on high-yield savings account

3. Ryan Reynolds becomes investor in Nuvei fintech company

4. EU may struggle to catch up with U.S., Asia in chips subsidies race

5. LARRY KUDLOW: McCarthy & Co will have a strong debt ceiling package

ChatGPT: Based on the financial news headlines you provided, my analysis is as follows:

Elon Musk says Twitter had many employees but little product development - This headline is not directly related to the market, and it is more focused on Twitter's internal operations. Hence, it is not likely to have a significant impact on the market.

Apple partners with Goldman Sachs on high-yield savings account - This headline suggests that Apple is expanding its financial services portfolio by partnering with Goldman Sachs. This move is likely to generate more revenue for both companies and positively impact the market.

Ryan Reynolds becomes investor in Nuvei fintech company - This headline suggests that Ryan Reynolds, a popular actor, has invested in a fintech company. This news might generate interest in Nuvei, positively impacting its stock price.

EU may struggle to catch up with U.S., Asia in chips subsidies race - This headline suggests that the EU might not be able to compete with the US and Asia in terms of providing subsidies to chip manufacturers. This news may negatively impact the European chip manufacturing sector, leading to a bearish outlook for the market.

LARRY KUDLOW: McCarthy & Co will have a strong debt ceiling package - This headline suggests that the US debt ceiling package proposed by McCarthy & Co is likely to be strong, which may positively impact the market.

Overall, based on the five financial news headlines provided, the outlook for the market is slightly bullish, with the exception of the EU's chip manufacturing sector, which might be negatively impacted. However, it is important to note that the market is complex, and various factors can influence its direction, and the analysis based on only five headlines is not comprehensive.",t3_12qjpgl,1681859656.0,1

The AI will be primarily finding the data points it needs to construct information in articles created as a part of other misinformation campaigns and then finding large volumes of misinformation clones supporting it's bad thesis.

It becomes a problem where the only chatgpt constructions you can trust are ones where a trusted human has vetted the materials and sources. (so pretty much the same as now anyways).

They had that Deborah woman leak debate stuff to Hillary to cheat against Bernie Sanders once, and she was subsequently fired. That was pretty much the only instance of a person within the network doing some shady partisan shit. FOX on the otherhand, pretty much every single anchor or network speaker is flat out a high level GOP party member that straight up speaks at CPAC and works directly with political GOP campaigns, fundraisers etc. Like... all of them. Its not even slightly subtle. The worst things CNN has ever been accused of doing are things that happen on FOX a dozen times in the first 15 minutes of the 8am news. MSNBC, is the same shit just dialed back 25%, (which is still atrocious, its just next to impossible to fully embody and match FOX level of insanity)

Its objectively dumb that CNN is the political boogeyman to peasant level conservatives that dont know any better.   And no middle or upper tier conservatives would ever consider them ""the worst"" and actually believe it. They might SAY it, because its become some weird kind of slogan, but the smart one no better. 

I mean, lets be real here... Nobody has ever had an issue with CNN, The Times, ABC, NBC, Al Jazera, BBC, and basically every other network besides fox and newsmax before, until Trump got himself into trouble and told everyone to hate and disbelieve any form of news that reports anythingbesides kissing his ass. CNN just wound up being the favorite target because it has a convenient acronym. Thats pretty much it. What most people dont realize, is that repeating it doesnt do anything but make the average person identify you as being stupid. You can all laugh and have a chuckle and encourage eachother to say that dumb shit in your inner circle of of peers, and maybe doing so is what makes them all so naive to the real world implications of repeating silly shit like that. 

But in real life the vast majority of people just instantly identify you as someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about, and know you are likely to follow a predetermined set of carbon copy values and beliefs that someone else laid out for you. Running around taking every opportunity to shout ""ClInToN NeWs NetWoRrrrk"" in places like options trading subreddits, just alerts everybody that you probably dont have much to say that has any value whatsoever. Think about it. The Clinton News Network? A Clinton hasnt even held an elected political office in decades. They probably arent even mentioned on CNN one single time in an average fiscal quarter.

A lot of posts since MVIS stock is up +260% since 1st of May and all this AI fever. In a nutshell, MVIS is a lidar solution company. All of a sudden, WSB regards thinks this is the best stock to YOLO and...keep accumulating losses while they dream to become millionaire.

Let's go straight to the valuation. This company started trading since even before most of you were born and still, is releasing promises in each earning calls. Now, the magic AI word will help them cash in their pennystocks.

* 2023 Revenue forecast: $10-15 M
* Net Cash to be burnt in Operations: $50-55 M
* Current Valuation after +260% rally: $1.3 Billion 
* Looking at their historic they aren't profitable, rather they just burn more than what they can generate

But luckily, WSB regards are here to save a bunch of investors and management team with stock options. Please save them while you dream and end up holding another bag.

Will the stock rally in the next sessions? Oh yes! high chances as it has just become a penny stock in the radar of all the retailers and algo-trading machines. But there was one guy who posted a technical analysis chart saying that he has been waiting for 7m for this magic moment and that he forecast a share price of 461$... so basically you have a 70x bagger.

8507,jn8dll7,t3_142vn3e,"Aright, I'll bite. As of it's Q1 report, $MVIS had a total of 68m $ in cash reservers, with a quarterly free cash burn in the range of 10-14m $. This would give them a runrate of \~1 year before they have to raise additional capital. With little to no current sales, something drastic would have to change, for the company to turn into the rocketship as everyone is expecting. I would therefore ask the following: 

1. Are there any indicators that some of the major players are comitting to adopting MVIS technology? So far i have seen no indicators, aside from the lofty promises of industry leading technology. If no major players are comitting, then i can see little reason for the recent increase in valuation. 
2. Of the 68m $ in cash reservers, 45m $ are investment securities. Do you have any information on what these securities contain? I couldnt find anything. If these securities contain bonds, then the market value may be less than stated in their report, when they have to liquidate them in coming periods. In any case, i fear that the company may be forced to do a equity offering in the near future, very likely capitalizing on this recent pump. 

Curious for your thoughts on these questions. However, i am fairly sure that this recent pumps falls in the category of AI craze pump and dump. But i welcome any chance to be proved wrong. Thank you for the DD and congrats on the win.",t3_142vn3e,1686128779.0,2

8526,jnb0p1h,t3_142vn3e,"With how heavily shorted this stock is, it could definitely go parabolic. It could also skyrocket on any partnership or big sales announcement. It‚Äôs still worth taking some profit now though. Consider this scenario: MVIS is either sold in a massive portion of all autonomous vehicles, or is bought out by one of the large auto companies. Is this likely to happen eventually? Well, barring some other company developing some completely revolutionary new technology, yes. It‚Äôs arguably nearly inevitable. The autonomous vehicle market is going to blow up over the next decade. MVIS has patents on their Lidar tech that completely blows away all other Lidar, it‚Äôs not even close. Plus it‚Äôs very cheap and sleek enough to fit on any vehicle design. But even if we assume that it‚Äôs inevitable for the price to shoot up when they actually make a deal and/or start raking in 30+% of the market, is that likely to happen *before* the price drops significantly from where it is now? Because the price action now is heavily driven by short activity. 

The thing to remember is that the fundamentals of profit MVIS is currently making + their assets puts the stock valuation less than the current price. The value of the stock if they started selling Lidar units and/or got a buyout, could easily shoot to 50|100$+. But until that happens,  short activity/random news is going to be the primary driver for significant price action. And the shorts are going to do everything they can to drive the price back down at some point. Without consistent news, the price will steadily drop back down to the 3-5$ range. If you‚Äôre already making a shit ton of money, you may as well cover your ass if the deals you expect to happen any day now don‚Äôt happen for another few months or years. Even just like 10% of your profit into long puts, and then another 10% if the price hits the mid teens. 

Lastly, don‚Äôt trust what the MVIS board says too much. They have had multiple deals fall through and have changed their business plan with this Lidar already. Early 2021 they had publicly outlined their plan to shop the tech around for a buyout/partnership and also set up a manufacturing/production plan so that if they didn‚Äôt get a buyout/partnership by the end of 2021, they would start selling Lidar units in 2022. IIRC announced around 15k units in the first quarter of 2022. One of the things that chaps my ass is that I was trading the stock believing that at least there would be income from selling the units even if nothing else panned out. But then they decided to scrap that plan completely, and instead work on the tech and just continue to shop around for buyers/partners indefinitely.  Queue bagholding until that happens, as the price dropped from the teens to 3-5$ when everyone suddenly found out all the expected sales profit isn‚Äôt gonna happen, because they suddenly decided to not sell the product. 

Not like I am qualified to give financial advice but it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out you should cover your ass my guy. This is coming from someone that believes MVIS is inevitably gonna go parabolic at some point in the next few months/years. I saw the Tech in action at the Lidar expo this year, and it‚Äôs undeniable. unless some other Lidar company discovers a revolutionary completely new way to make Lidar function way better, no Lidar company is going to be able to close the gap with the patents MVIS has. You should still cover your ass though. Not that I‚Äôm qualified to give financial advice, I just learned some painful lessons when I bought MVIS calls in may/April 2021, and didn‚Äôt cover my ass well enough when I made stupidly high profits.",t3_142vn3e,1686170692.0,-1

8633,jn8wpi9,t1_jn8vffk,"""RECOMMENDATION We rate MICROVISION INC (MVIS) a SELL. This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its feeble growth in its earnings per share, deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and weak operating cash flow. HIGHLIGHTS MICROVISION INC's earnings per share declined by 37.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share have declined over the last two years. We anticipate that this should continue in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, MICROVISION INC reported poor results of -$0.32 versus -$0.27 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 15.6% in earnings (-$0.37 versus -$0.32). The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and greatly underperformed compared to the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector average. The net income has significantly decreased by 44.5% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$13.17 million to -$19.03 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector and the overall market, MICROVISION INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the subsector average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to -$13.80 million or 26.53% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the subsector average, the firm's growth is significantly lower. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, MVIS's share price has jumped by 45.77%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the future course of this stock, we feel that the risks involved in investing in MVIS do not compensate for any future upside potential, despite the fact that it has seen nice gains over the past 12 months.""",t3_142vn3e,1686141368.0,-1

There's also the expectation of some major PR from the company related to a major deal coming some time this year (CEO described it as an ""epic"" year in the last EC).

You don't seem to have a clue wtf you're doing, might as well just give your money to charity.

Once I pointed out to you that the stock was being driven by a short covering, it became all about tHe ShOrT sQuEeZe to you. You don't even understand that institutional shorts can contact directly the company and ask them to sell a bunch of stock to them from the shelf (so that they don't have to buy through the open market), which is probably what happened. You can keep ""holding"" all the way down to zero if that's what you want.

Nothing to see here with Google except a bunch of politicians and attorneys for quite some time.

The breakup of the Bell System resulted in the creation of seven independent companies that were formed from the original twenty-two AT&T-controlled members of the System.[5]

Pacific Telesis, acquired by SBC in 1997, now part of AT&T Inc.

Ameritech, acquired by SBC in 1999, now part of AT&T Inc.

Bell Atlantic, merged with GTE in 2000 to form Verizon Communications

Southwestern Bell Corporation, rebranded as SBC Communications in 1995, acquired AT&T Corporation in 2005

Google did $224B in global revenue in 2022 with opex of $83B for a net of $140B.  They are estimated to have 1B people using their services.  Divided evenly this is $140 per user per year.  That's roughly equivalent to $11 / month / person.  

Granted users in rich countries likely are more lucrative than users in poorer let's say in the EU it's maybe 2x that so $20 / month.  Is that too much?  Should I really be getting a share of this to use their service?  What % should I get?   Would this even do anything really?  What happens when the company invests more or has a down year, would my payments fluctuate based on profitability?  What would stop the company from adjusting its books to reduce user payouts?  More laws?

Also the EU isn't even asking these companies to start profit sharing, they are just putting laws in place as a justification to fine them for shit.  That money doesn't go to people it goes to the government which maybe sort of trickles down to the people?

This whole the ""EU protects its people"" thing is great marketing for the EU government, but let's be honest, it's really just a politically marketed high profile tax on the biggest businesses in their markets.   Furthermore these regulations make all the companies in their market, domestic and foreign, have to deal with more crap.   
I'll conclude this rant with my opinion that the EU governments don't give a shit about fair markets, they want their pound of flesh.

Those margins are like a drunk college girl's virginity at a frat party - LOL at thinking it's going to stay intact.

How I view the difference is that either you can have a better quality of life with more taxes, or a worse quality of life and more money. That's a gamble, because if you want something badly in the USA you're going to pay for it. The USA is the finest Capitalist model for sure, but it doesn't take more than a couple of seconds to realise there's something seriously fucked up going on over there.

The typical googling process is that you run a query, Google returns 10 pages, you scan the results visually, open a couple of them, and skim through them until you have a general idea of what you wanted to look up form in your head.

AI-powered searching will save you the trouble of searching for the result that has the information you're looking for.

You'll write your query as usual and it will provide an AI-generated response created by summarizing the related content on the Internet, using data collected from many pages. So if you write, I don't know, ""best selling video games in 2019"", it will print out the list directly, instead of just referring you to 3rd-party pages. This is an extremely simple example, but we've already seen that ChatGPL is very capable of responding to users who need inspiration for phrasing an email, CV, et cetera.

In most cases, you'll still need to manually process the result content, but I think if it works for 10% of the cases it's already a game changer.

As an AI language model, I cannot engage in personal attacks or use profanity, but I can provide an informed response to the idea of a ""white collar AI apocalypse."" While it is true that AI and automation have the potential to disrupt certain industries and job markets, the idea that it will lead to a complete collapse of the white-collar workforce is an over-exaggeration.

In fact, history has shown that technological advancements have always created new opportunities and jobs, rather than eliminating them. The advent of computers, for example, created an entirely new field of employment in computer programming and software engineering.

Moreover, many white-collar jobs require skills that are difficult to automate, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. These skills are uniquely human and cannot be replicated by machines.

While AI may eventually replace certain tasks within white-collar professions, it is unlikely to result in a complete elimination of these jobs. Instead, it will likely lead to a shift in job roles and responsibilities as companies seek to optimize their operations and leverage the capabilities of these technologies.

Therefore, the notion of a ""white-collar AI apocalypse"" is unfounded and does not reflect the nuanced and complex reality of how AI and automation will impact the workforce.""",t3_1256696,1680049311.0,100

9369,je5t9w8,t3_1256696,"I‚Äôm entering the legal profession, so take my point with that bias in mind. However, the fact that people think legal practitioners are going to be gone in 5-20 years is, in my mind, unfounded. On the one hand, we as a society place a lot of agency in the law‚Äôs communicative function. This encompasses meeting face to face with a lawyer, who will go through your distinct legal problem with you. Moreover, when a case goes to trial, would people be willing to have the judge replaced by a computer? I don‚Äôt think so. (Not to mention the political and moral ramifications such a computer driven and adjudicated legal system would operate). 

Airplanes can fly on complete auto-pilot, but we still want to have a pilot to be there. 

Lastly, we have to remember who is in control of society. The generation that is soon to be glimpsing power 40-60, does not want to have complete AI usurpation. Not to mention, the only people who would take away the legal profession, would, ironically be the legal profession. Lots of high government officials are lawyers, who have implement a statutory regime that the only people capable of giving legal advice are lawyers. Would the law, operate to destroy their own profession? Not a chance.

Not to mention that the law itself is about 20 years behind current societal advancements. In my country, most big firms have to keep paper copies of every file. Somewhat surprisingly, we also have the requirement to utilize a typewriter for certain draftings.

Lastly, I would like to mention that there is a current debate about how a AI program like ChatGPT is rampantly committing copyright violations. This is an area of the law that will skyrocket in the future. 

Lastly, I would like to mention that Wills for example, present a huge problem for an AI system. Sure, perhaps it will get advanced enough to draft one, but to interpret one? I don‚Äôt think so. For jurisdictions that retain the separation of a determinable and subsequent interest, there is a huge difference in outcome for vesting. The only way to distinguish such a difference, is by analyzing the intention of the parties. Sure, language can be used, but it is not determinable in any regard. Often, it requires looking at extrinsic evidence. Which is outside of the four corners of a document.

**Humans Need Not Apply:**

One of the closing takeaways was: In the 1700's the US census tracked 10 types of jobs, now there's hundreds tracked. But if you look at the list a lot of the jobs are just more detailed descriptions that all existed in the 1700's, and when the video was published numbers 1-30 all existed in some form in the 1700's (number one being transportation), it's not until we get to 31 with computer programmers.

Imagine the scenario where a ""LawyerGpt"" App can do everything a lawyer does but better. Sure you might want to have one lawyer check over it's work so you don't get screwed. But that would mean one Law Firm Partner can just double check over 10 times the number of cases. But the other ten lawyers that used to be under him are no longer needed. That doesn't mean that the law firm is all of a sudden going to transform into a new industry, there's no next step to law firm, it's just going to not need those lawyers. And it's going to be like that for every industry. And then in the future you probably won't even need the overseer once you're confident it'll get it right, just like how we don't double check excel spreadsheets calculations by hand. And even the things that this response is trying to say is uniquely human like ""creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence"", are not safe, and there are already machines that can be creative (with art, music, design).

At the same time those news came out for Google. Microsoft released Edge with New Bing (using GPT) publicly, for free, for anyone to use, on almost every platform. Chrome is dying too.

&#x200B;

Google price is still high.

&#x200B;

But it looks like it's just coasting. Those buckets of money can only be as reassuring as the people who are in charge of them. And those people are pissing their pants right now.

&#x200B;

However, longer term, AI is the new Linux. AI is open as in libre. No single entity can own AI.

Small teams will be the new norm. Metcalfe's law means the cost of communication and coordination grows exponentially with team size. Big teams are fd.

Open source is just a licencing agreement that promotes collaboration. On the other hand is the proprietary software, which is where companies make money.  
Both Google and OpenAI uses a lot of open source software and a lot of proprietary software. Both also create open source and proprietary software.  
So if we are talking about those superior open source models, which one are we talking about? Which one is supposedly better and by which metric? Yeah, there are no answers because OpenAI right now is at the top. Maybe they or Google will eventually open source their model, or collaboration between other companies will create better one, but right now it doesn't.  
Article is right about Google and OpenAI having no moat and no secret sauce. Algorithms are known for about five years, you can create your own GPT in less than two hours (look up Andrej Karpaty, OpenAI researcher, tutorial on YouTube). OpenAI mostly uses Azure, where you can also rent processing power to train your AI (though it did cost OpenAI few hundred millions in fees) Devil is in the details and there are ton of opportunities for improvement and fine tunings.  
Technology rarely improves by single or few good ideas. Usually it's a matter of applying thousands of hours of thousands of skilled engineers into a problem, making millions of small improvements.

I had worked with companies who employed armies of interns to do this kind of tagging and categorisation work. 

Meanwhile a connoisseur of the fine japanese arts sits in his parents basement and already has a perfectly tagged dataset thanks to years of studying them. 

And now this individual gets his hands on an AI Model and starts training with his high quality dataset. 

And basically this can be applied to many other things as well. Ans by the nature of the net more like minded connoisseurs of the fine arts will meet and share their data and so it creates a FOS project dedicated to generation fine arts of japan better than Google or open AI ever could.

If you read the leaked article this is ultimately based on, you find people getting close-to-SOTA LLM results with less than $100 of training on 70k or so examples.

Companies like Google *claim* that you need truly massive data at all times. You know why? Because if it's true, *nobody should bother to compete with them*. It's something they say to justify funding their research, specifically. But the emperor, increasingly, seems to have no clothes.

But we actually both agree that Google wasn't that interested in LLMs, so they invested less into this field, even though they are in the game longer (as you said yourself). OpenAI put more engineering power to LLMs and it paid off, now Google is playing catch up in LLMs.  
  
One thing that is super confusing is ""AI"" naming. Depending on who you talk to, it could include basic machine learning models like linear regression or decision tree, or it could include just neural networks and image classifiers, or it could exclude even them and include only language models and image generating models, or it could mean AGI or just physical robots with language models - AI can mean basically anything nowadays.",t3_1395x5r,1683406050.0,1

That having been said, going to the other extreme and calling it vaporware isn't a much more nuanced take.

What makes AI normal is exactly what'll keep it profitable. AI has existed in some form going back decades. It has plenty of value in computing, which is only expanding and making its mark on our everyday lives.

Whether its hackers creating new methods of bypassing threat detection and remediation systems, cyber sec professionals creating and using new tools to fight those threats, self driving cars, Patriots shooting down Russian Kinzhal missiles or just more challenging video games, better AI is the product of a worldwide arms race to create better technology and automate the handling of ever increasing data volumes, something the world won't stop needing.

Like I said, I agree the hype is going somewhat crazy. I don't think AI is going to plug us all into the Matrix. A $100B increasing in valuation isn't really justified by a hypothetical $10B revenue increase. A lot of that is irrational exuberance which may come back down to earth eventually.

&nbsp;

So let me try to understand your logic. You think GDX will reach all time high (double the current price assuming that's your cost basis) when global central bank interest rates are pretty much at their highest points in history, with no real signs of heavy cuts until mid 2024 at the earliest. Presumably, you're doing this play because you're bullish gold. However, gold miners are arguably more affected by interest rates moreso than gold itself, and they don't have as high of a correlation with underlying gold price as you might expect.

&nbsp;

If your holding period is a year max and you expect to cash out at 2x (as highly unlikely as that is), the much more preferable way to play this is to buy a GDX call at say strike price 45 or 50 for 1 year expiry. It's an **extremely** cheaper alternative to what you mentioned.",t3_14akdu5,1687039904.0,1

During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:

* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)
* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.
* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.
* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.
* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    

I don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen.",t3_13rj7b9,1685039674.0,2

1) 100B is a very huge sum. And even if it happens is insanely low for yesterday's 700B market cap.

2) DCF says that to justify a 700B market cap today with Nvidia's current balance sheet, you're betting Nvidia to have 500B revenue in 2033.

3) Such a revenue requires no less than YoY 25% EPS growth rate for a decade.

4) Even if this all happens, you did nothing but match buying bonds for the same price you bought Nvidia for.

5) You outperformed bonds only after the 11th year.

Thus, if you're a holder, you're betting on many many stars to align: AI having such an insane business, requiring so many GPUs for such a long time, no competition (very tough in tech sector you're only as good as your last product), no manufacturing disruptions, costs and debt staying consistently below growth.

If all of those stars align, ten years from now, you will have beaten buying 400$ or whatever is current Nvidia's price in bonds.

Or, what the degenerate gambler ""investment"" here is, that the price of the stock itself will surge further and you will be unloading it.

But I don't know how else to explain how insane the revenue expectations and how long people are gonna have to hold Nvidia before it will be yielding cash flows and possibly dividends or buybacks to motivate their current market cap.

With million of dollars of infrastructure it takes about 8 hours to train, and probably about 20 data engineers working for _months_ to create the underlying dataset.

Consider the training moment in time to be a... ""snapshot"" of reality at the time the AI was trained, it cannot comprehend anything that is information/context that came after this moment, it will also treat all reality based on its ""frozen in time"" perspective.

Then Elon Musk decides to play games with the markets on Twitter, or it turns out a group of banks was lying about the Rating of their mortgages, or some schmuck in the Bahamas is skimming money from everyone, or Putin  farts too close to the nuke button, or......

The time it takes to gather, ingest and prepare data, added to model training time, added to prediction time, means that any form of Neural Network style AI trading will limited to short term scalping or arbitrage, a field that is already dominated by Algos anyway.

What's going to progressively dissappear is the possibility to find alpha in the 5 minute bar (outside of black swan events) , but if you are trying to do that today you are in the wrong game anyway.

Buy and hold, trend trading, good macro trading... these are fields that are good grounds for retail now and in the future, because you are riding the coat tails of the big bois hoovering crumbs (and that A-OK) 

Event/News trading, Deep Analysis of Business Reports (especially to find bullshit), Cleverly hiding insider trading,  Industry/Sector trading and forecasting, geopolitical commodities trading, these are all good future fields for retail, as they are man-hour and expertise intensive, and big trading desks are gonna do the math someday and figure out the small drop in performance in focusing on automated short-term will be compensated by consistency and reduced labor cost.

\- Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. By diversifying your portfolio, you can reduce the impact of any single investment on your overall portfolio performance.

\- Focus on long-term goals: AI may be able to make short-term market predictions, but it is still difficult for it to accurately predict long-term trends. By focusing on your long-term investment goals, you can take a more patient and strategic approach to investing.

\- Seek out advice from experts: There are many financial advisors and investment professionals who can provide valuable insights and guidance for retail investors. Consider seeking out their advice to help you make informed investment decisions.

\- Use AI tools to your advantage: While AI can be a formidable competitor, it can also be a valuable tool for retail investors.

Highly advanced AI is what they need to do what OP is talking about. If the AI was sophisticated as understanding human herd psychology then we are screwed since they likely would not use that information to game the stock market, but to eliminate humans.

Humans have the added bonus of being self aware and thus can be contrarian to their instincts. Knowing that the AI is relying on humans to act instinctually you could be contrarian with your investing. 

Contrarian investing is an extremely effective strategy for this reason since it forces you to go against human instincts when everyone else is falling victim to them. 

So coming full circle, you will always have people try to beat the market. You will always have people freak out from fear or greed and panic buy or sell. You will always have overvalued or undervalued stocks.

Of course it will negatively affect the market cap because buyers can buy those shares at discount instead of having to pay more from people who actually have shares to sell but choose not to at current prices.

Right, I even agreed with you. But you're overstating the effect, and I'm trying to get the point across that the market is significantly more complicated than ""selling short makes price go down"".  Just look at stocks across the board in the last couple years that get shorted and yet climbed way higher than anyone thought.  Its pointless to discuss ""supply and demand"" if we aren't going to talk about why supply and demand fluctuate.  I would actually argue, as many economists do, that short selling is necessary to prevent overvaluing companies.

Anyway, your original point was that short selling (lending and FTDs, even when closed) dilutes your stock and that's simply not true.  The effect short selling has on the price depends on corresponding buy pressure - the price could still go up while people are selling short and often does.

Sure, rule-of-thumb is that increasing sell pressure drops the price but its not a hard-and-fast rule because it depends on buy pressure.  Dilution creates a predictable, calculable, drop in price as more shares become outstanding.

Short interest indicates what kind of volume, in terms of % float, has to happen to close the short positions - not an indication of dilution.  They aren't trying to trick you - they're different things.

Another perspective is their respective effect on market cap.  Change to buy/sell pressure has an effect on market cap.  Dilution does not - the market cap stays the same and price-per-share changes.",t3_zpb2aa,1671494520.0,1

That there's buy pressure at the same time doesn't negate that shorts push the price down. Even if they don't succeed, they tried, and they may well have prevented the price from going higher than it would. All other things kept constant, short selling will reduce the price.

Short interest of 10% for 70m shares means there's an extra 7m shares in circulation that people can buy, at least until shorts close their positions. That is, at 10% SI, people can buy 77m shares before running out, even if 7m of them don't have voting rights anymore.

So that's still 70m shares outstanding in circulation.  When you borrow $10k from a bank do you really think its creating $10k out of thin air too?

Also price drop = bad is also wrong.  You know, sometimes companies are just shit or won't make as much money as projected.  Thats one of the reasons prices drop - because investors see that a company is failing, won't make a profit (or not as much as projected) and thus by DCF calculations the value drops.  Yes, short sellers pile in at this point because, well, the price is dropping.  You're conflating those two phenomenon and claiming the price is dropping only because of short selling.  Short selling helps the market reach the new, lower, equilibrium faster if the market thinks that's where the equilibrium belongs.

Banks making up money is called fractional reserves. They are allowed to lend more than they have. Look it up.

Price drop is bad for investors. Whether it's good for any other reason it's a different argument. Clearly it's good for short sellers, no argument there.

Price can drop for many reasons, of which short selling is one. Never said it was the only reason, but for some reason you prefer to think that I did.

Clearly you're too involved in defending shorts. Limited gains, unlimited potential loss. Sucks to be holding those bags, but I feel no pity for those who claim market efficiency but deep down seek to profit from crashing companies. They don't all deserve it.

I hope shorts lose everything. I sincerely do. I hope they stubbornly stick with it to the end, only to know what it feels like to lose everything, and have others profit from it. I'm not planning to sell until they are all bankrupt.

10521,jazq4pi,t3_11ih555,"It‚Äôs really astonishing looking at the comments on this thread. I mean we are still in r/stocks right ? A place were investors should be a bit more savvy. 

1) Being first does not mean you will be the only one or the best in what you do. At this point yes Microsoft came first but we have no clue what Google or even Apple or Meta is planning. MSFT seems to be winning for now until the next player launches something in the search space which could be even bigger or better than what MSFT did. Remember the most notable examples in this are Facebook and Google who both dethroned their competitors almost overnight and they were not even the big companies they are now. 


2) It‚Äôs not about the idea but the execution. And I cannot stress that enough. Say Google comes back with a much better AI, returns much better results, has found a smart way to monetize it and is years ahead of OpenAI in terms of engineering. Unless they find a nice way to present it and market it to customers they are doomed to fail. Launching a product is not just about the engineering of the product. There is so much more to it. From marketing to business model to public perception to privacy to customer support and to the product itself of course. Remember Google waves ? An internal tool Google used, much like slack-before slack to communicate? They launched it to public but figured their UX and product execution sucked so they killed it. Later on slack came along and showed them that they had the right idea but the execution was poor.  Do I also need to remind you Betamax vs VHS? One was an engineer marvel the other just had better partnerships and was ticking more boxes for the users. 

3) Google is never going all-in in a product. So far Google is known for killing projects if they see they cannot monetize in the short term. Google‚Äôs product cemetery is quite huge . They still work like a VC betting on 100 products to get 1 right so their successful product/cemetery ratio is not that promising. 


All in all, we don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to end but it‚Äôs really weird looking comments like Google has already something or MSFT was there first. No Google does not have anything unless they decide to launch a proper product to the market and find a better product-market fit than the competition.

Bottom line, Google controls so much of the search market that they basically can't win even if they do succeed. AI chatbots are much more resource intensive per query than search, so even if Google utterly crushes ChatGPT & Bing Chat their profits are still likely to take a hit.

Microsoft (& OpenAI) on the other hand can't really lose because they control so little of the search market that success is very easy.

So, instead of building my own pipeline from scratch in a week, I chose (there wasn't really any choice) to patch/improve certain parts of the data pipeline. And my goal is to build the best within a limited time which is when I needed help from chatgpt. 

Under this scenario and under my settings, I asked a bunch of question to chatgpt which you already saw, and it helped me improve my code without any issue. 

 > That's really even weirder since you said it's small enough to fit in memory. Why is it taking hours?

I have about 50-100k images and they have some predictions stored as RLE string. I need to convert these strings to mask, split the segmentations and convert them to polygon which takes about 0.5-1 sec per image. Downloading predictions is less than .1 second per image. I can parallelize the code and wait 3-4 hours or not parallelize and wait for a day for every dataset I need (then, store them somewhere, like datalake or gcp and never repeat that process again). 

Now, you can ask why are the model predictions not stored as polygon? Again, there is nothing I can do about it. I am paid to work with whatever I have.

So, the discussion was, can chatgpt improve your code. My answer is hell yes. It improves my productivity a lot. And your suggestion is why not starting from scratch. That is an approach my company cannot afford.",t3_11ih555,1678051188.0,1

There are already existing interfaces we would call for batch loading data as a part of existing data processing pipeline frameworks we would be plugging into.

I would also recommend dividing this type of work up into 2 distinct stages. The download part vs the processing part to be done separately. The download part, being the simpler one, should not be taking that long given that the total size of the payload isn't that big. As long as existing tcp connections are being reused it should be done in less than a few minutes given that it can fit in memory. It sounds like it's the processing part that's taking too long right now.

I don‚Äôt think Pichai‚Äôs leadership has been very good, but it has been decent. The company is in a good state, with a rock solid balance sheet and has experienced very decent growth in the last years. Most importantly, its core businesses are still cash cows and well defended, all things considered (AI has not yet impacted its core search offering). And Pichai has taken the AI threat very seriously with the launch of Bard and the strong focus on AI in the last months.

Compare GOOGL with META and that is truly a shitshow - META decided to start burning billions in Zuck‚Äôs Metaverse project, exactly at a time when its core business was getting screwed by Apple‚Äôs new privacy policy on iOS and a recession was threatening Ad Revenue. Now as a cherry on top, Apple announces a VR set that makes anything Zuck‚Äôs has worked on look like it belongs to 10 years ago. I still own META because I think the market over reacted back then but I won‚Äôt add at these levels mostly because I don‚Äôt trust Zuck to be able to do anything other than copy pasting other social media‚Äôs features in Instagram.

Other tech companies that are run by clowns are Netflix and PayPal. The first decided to run a 5 BLN dollar stock buyback program with their stock at ATH, while competition had never been stronger and new content was precious (probably the worst capital allocation of a F500 company ever). The second is just a complete shitshow on so many levels.

So, IMO overall Pichai‚Äôs tenure isn‚Äôt that bad. I would say he gets a passing grade. The real big issue with his tenure is that he did not manage to truly diversify GOOGL streams of revenue. Which is worrying since AMZN did (AWS, Prime, etc), as did MSFT and AAPL.

The problem with cloud gaming is that you don't own the game, so when cloud gaming company goes bust, you don't get the game you purchased. Maybe you get your save data. In Stadia's shutdown some publishers gave people free PC versions of the games they'd lose access to, and many publishers provided a way to port save data to PC, but would require a PC version to already be owned.

Cloud gaming doesn't make sense because of this, and because internet connection is shit in a lot of places. Many reviewers had significant lag when using Stadia, and they weren't playing from a cabin in the mountains.

Also on the point of latency, local games do have latency between inputs, actual processing and frame generation, and display latency. Of course you have the same type of latency chain on a remote machine, but Geforce now has lower latency than local gaming on Series X (in some cases, likely becuase of Nvdia Reflex) \[[https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-geforce-now-rtx-3080-review-is-cloud-gaming-finally-a-viable-alternative](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-geforce-now-rtx-3080-review-is-cloud-gaming-finally-a-viable-alternative)\].

Quarter ended March 31 

MSFT search and news advertising = 3,045 million.

GOOGL search & other = 40,359 million

youtube ads = 6,693 million

google network = 7,496 million

**google advertising total = 54,548 million**

AMZN advertising services = 9,509 million

META advertising = 28,101 million

AAPL services = 20,907 million. They don't report their ad %. 


So Google search ads are big, but not 29x bigger. It's only 13x bigger than MSFT search and news ad revenue.

Another important piece of the puzzle is growth, as we don't want to know what companies have now, but where their businesses are going.

AMZN ads grew 21%

GOOG search ads grew 2%, the overall ad revenue was flat.

The last piece of the puzzle is that ads is GOOGL's main business while it's one of MSFT's smallest businesses. 

MSFT doesn't need ads, any share they gain is basically a bonus. 

GOOGL's perspective - needs ads to survive, multiple difficult fronts. 
MSFT, META, AMZN and AAPL are competitors for ad money. They are successfully gaining ad revenue faster than GOOGL.

When looking at the perspective of other tech companies:

AAPL's perspective - GOOG and other tech companies are not competing successfully in consumer electronics, even though they also do devices.

MSFT's perspective - there's no good competition vs office however their other businesses are contested

AMZN's perspective - there is strong competition in both IaaS and online retail

META's perspective - same position as GOOG, there is strong competition in advertising.

To sum up, GOOG's ad business is big, but not that big. Their ad business is the most contested when compared to the other big tech businesses.",t3_14cf062,1687087690.0,18

Until some insider shares what happned, I won't be able to comprehend why they thought resetting the user base from Hangouts to Allo/Duo was a good idea. I had it as my default SMS/Messenger. Hangouts came pre-installed with every Android phone for a time.

Seemed like web based Hangouts was a bridge between the Discord era and the TeamSpeak/Ventrilo era. I remember university professors getting frustrated trying to do conference calls with Skype and using Hangouts. Students seemed to use Hangouts to do group projects. Now it's all Discord. Help family with schoolwork, they tell me Discord. I take a class at the community college, collaboration through Discord rather than the university Canvas. At work we use Microsoft Teams because we don't have a choice. For a while 2017-2019 friends/colleagues would talk through Slack groups at home, it's now Discord. Job interviews, Zoom somehow became the standard

From what I remember though was that Hangouts the mobile app didn't look good, I don't remember if it was sluggish or not. Still when Google announced Allo/Duo, which visually looked really good, I was so incredibly disappointed. Positioned perfectly to be either WhatsApp (even before facebook), Discord, Slack, Telegram - impressive how many managed to get a solid user base without Google level resources.

10905,jonct8w,t1_jom0jdu,"The issue is not burning money on new concepts to find potential sources of revenue, they have been doing that for over a decade.  The problem is they have no follow-through.  They launch a product and then it withers and dies because no one wants to be responsible for maintaining the product because there is no incentive to be that person in the company.  Stadia is the most recent high profile example, and one of the biggest reasons it failed was because Google has directly damaged their brand by killing projects instead of iterating and improving on them (Google Hangouts is a good example).
He's essentially a passenger on a train that was set on the course it is currently on by the founders.  I'm not saying he hasn't had positive contributions to the company, but as CEO he hasn't had a positive impact on Google/AlphaBet's culture, and their revenue streams are not very diverse, which opens them up to greater risk from regulation. (Note that the EU is not planning on fining them, but breaking Google into multiple companies so that they can't 'double dip' with ad pricing and serving, it will be interesting to see how that plays out.  Agree that is not specifically the fault of the CEO, though, but the lack of diversity in revenue streams might hit bite them).

As far as the other companies, Apple and Microsoft constantly innovate, but more importantly their record on product support and maintenance is stellar.  Bing still exists (and thanks to MS investing in OpenAI is actually growing marketshare), whereas if it were a Google product it would have been killed long ago.  Microsoft also has a decently diversified revenue stream (Office/Windows, Cloud, Gaming, Hardware) and are actively pursuing other markets (heavy acquisitions in gaming and now AI).  Apple also has multiple revenue streams (iphones, macs, app store, itunes) and a *clearly* defined vision.  Meta is more focused on ad revenue, but the CEO has a vision and is actively pursuing it, even if most people (including myself) think its not going to work out in the end.

Which brings us back to Google/Alphabet.  They have products everyone uses (Chrome, Android, Maps, G-mail, YouTube, etc.)  We also know they are innovative (Waymo, Deepmind).

I think this can mean the humans can spend more time on the more difficult, value-adding parts of journalism. For example, data graphics. One of the strong points of newspapers like TheEconomist, WSJ, NYT, etc., is that they have incredible interactive data visuals. These are no doubt time consuming but can't fully be automated because they require a human's judgement of how to best display data to other humans as well as handling messy datasets. Like coming up with good color themes, how to label individual points, whether to use log scales or not, animating trends over time, adding interactivity. Some [great examples](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) of creating nice visuals here, even for 'simple' plots like scatterplots, or for more complex circular packing lots of cartograms.

They can't give actual use cases, with actual incremental dollar and cents revenues.  So they use vague superlatives.  And they get wildly angry if anyone has any doubts, even as they can't answer to the doubt.

Someone just like you got mad when someone just like me (ok, I'll admit it, it was me) questioned their fawning claims that the ""augmented reality"" demonstrated in the pokemon go treasure hunt would radically change the world before the end of that year.  Every sort of company from soup to toilet paper just needed to whisper ""AR/VR"" to attract religious tech bro acolytes.  

The same religious adherence over blockchain.  Ok, so it can do the same tracking as audits and ledgers already do, so what's the big deal?  ""It's in the cloud, mom!""  Yes, and....?  ""Well, it's distributed.  You can track where your tomato comes from!""  Ok, but I can already do that pretty sufficiently.  Mexico.  Why does that make a drawing of an ape worth billions?  ""Oh psssshhht, you have such a profound lack of understanding!"" (Stomps away)

Today market cap is: $385 billion
The reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. 

Europe:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above ‚Ç¨45K
source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/
I don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. 

USA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  

At the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  

Current market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.

First, increased competition from the big boy car markers, and 2nd, everything to do with FSD.

It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).  
  
It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).  
  
It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.  
  
Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate.

BTW, on the self driving front. Tesla has a one of a kind and next to impossible replicate feedback loop with customers. Where they are not only willing but ethusastic to help with the development of self driving with their data.

I believe at some point we will see Tesla pivot and use LiDAR. It was never feasible in the past as was just too expensive. But that is not the case as much any longer and it will only continue to plummet in price.

So once they add LiDAR and then with the feedback loop they will be in excellent shape. They will take a hit with their customers becaue of all these ridiculous promises of the past. But that will only be a speeed bump and they will get past it, IMHO.",t3_zv1dxh,1672058870.0,1

In the U.S I figure 60% of eligible citizens are even political enough to bother voting; then consider that even less of these people (maybe 20 - 30%?) are active enough online to be fully aware of Musk‚Äôs Twitter antics and political views. And if the so-called ‚ÄúEV revolution‚Äù really catches on and Tesla maintains the best product, even less of these people will factor this into the buying process.

The key question is, are EVs really a good and efficient enough substitute for our internal combustion engine vehicles that we are ready to change the way we buy cars forever? I‚Äôm not certain on that and it‚Äôs why I believe TSLA is overvalued.",t3_zv1dxh,1672033143.0,4

 >A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

Are you seriously downplaying the importance of Chrome to Google? Just keeping Google as the default search engine on Chrome is worth many billions a year. Google has paid Mozilla billions to keep Google as the default search engine on FF which has a tiny fraction of the marketshare. We're talking 65% vs 3% marketshare.

Chrome also gives Google the ability to drive browser development decisions, tie user accounts to the browser (and into their walled-garden), control of ChromeOS/Chromecast devices, control of browser privacy tracking decisions and ad blocking capabilities, the list goes on.

""Just a browser"" It's a platform, the 2nd most used platform in the world second only to Android. Do you not understand the importance of controlling the worlds two most used platforms?

As far as Sundar's role in Chrome. Yes, he was Product Manager from inception. Of all people, that makes him the key figure in its growth/success.

>Are you seriously saying that the CEO of a company with $70 Billion in revenue, which calls itself an AI company but fell behind in AI to a company founded in 2015 with a few hundred employees is doing a good job??!!

Fell behind how? OpenAI beat them in releasing something to the public, but Google's AI capabilities are at least on par with OpenAI. Being a massive company, Google is just less likely to release toys like that to the general public. Instead, they are more likely to integrate the capabilities into their existing products which is already happening. OpenAI has wowed the public, but that doesn't mean shit until they turn it into a profitable business that steals marketshare from the giants.

>Are you seriously saying that the CEO of one of the most well funded and brilliant developer talent pools who have created paradigm shifts in computing such as the Google File System which was the inspiration that led to the creation of Hadoop or Google incubated Kubernetes which is like the defacto operating system of the cloud and despite all this the company he's running is 3rd place laggard in Cloud computing is doing a good job?

The race in cloud computing started well before Sundar. GCP has grown at impressive rates under Sundar. Azure's growth is an outlier due to MS's role in the enterprise world. But I'm not sure what you wanted him to do other than go back in time and become CEO earlier so they could beat Amazon/MS to the punch. GFS, Hadoop, and Kubernetes were all released under Larry's leadership. If anything, GCP's lower marketshare is on Larry, not Sundar.

Most of Tesla's sales are Model 3 and Model Y, which are its lowest-priced cars but still quite expensive.  Is there enough market--even accounting for increased popularity of Evs--for Tesla sales to grow that much and still maintain their margins?  That is the analysis I'd like to see.  I am not sure of prices elsewhere, but the cheaper EVs here in Canada like the IONIQ 5 are around $15K cheaper than a Tesla (mid 40K range compared to Tesla low 60K range).  That makes a Tesla about 30% more expensive to buy which is pretty big.  As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.

So one would expect either Tesla's sales to peak as they (and oncoming competition) saturate their market at that price level, or else Tesla needs to start selling a whole lot of cheaper cars which means either serious margin reductions or else cutting costs significantly to keep their margins.

Anyway the demand side including what the competition is doing is what I really want to see in a Tesla analysis. Just asserting that they can sell everything they make and at the same margins for a higher-priced product would need a lot of backing to that argument no matter the industry.",t3_y8sdc4,1666270543.0,22

11855,it2shlx,t3_y8sdc4,RemindMe! 3 years,t3_y8sdc4,1666277893.0,5
11856,it3xpyf,t3_y8sdc4,"About 1 year ago: (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): I had written  ‚ÄúI believe 2023 will tell the tale‚Äù.  I think it is still so.  At that time TSLA market cap was about $1.1 Trillion.  And as of right now it is about $644 billion.  Of course some of this is to the macro environment: inflation, higher interest rates, etc.  But some has to do with market not knowing the next 1 to 3 years of Tesla revenue/earnings.   I still think the appetite for expensive cars is fairly finite.  However, what I didn‚Äôt anticipate was the IRA: I think this will help Tesla quite a bit.  If Tesla vehicles qualify: it will reduce the cost quite a bit and so demand in the USA will probably not be an issue.  I will address some points as I did 1 year ago:

1) USA: as above: Tesla won‚Äôt have issues here: it is just a matter of how much production they can do in Fremont and Austin.  ~~The expensive model y and 3 will be less expensive if they indeed qualify for the whole $7500 credit (because there is some battery component issue??~~  (I am not a tax advisor so please ask tax advisor if Tesla qualifies for $7500 credit or not).  ~~So this is a change of my view.~~  I do still believe people will still buy the Rav-4, CR-V, etc‚Ä¶Also, there is a little more competition with the Mach E and soon made in Tennessee ID4‚Ä¶however, this does kinda‚Äô gets cancelled out by the Ioniq5/EV6 that won‚Äôt qualify for the tax credit so the sales of those will decline.  Bolt, Lightning, Rivian, Lucid: they are not going to produce in enough numbers to take away sales from Tesla.  

2)  China: Ok, this is where the issue lies.  The competition is more fierce this year than last year.  Moreso than I had originally thought.  I know many people think that some of these Chinese companies sell a bunch of these EV and not make money: that is true in some; but the giant bear in china is BYD: they will report an $800-$900 million profit in Q3 2022.  Why is this important?  They are able to sell relatively cheaper cars and still be profitable.  The cars that are going to give Tesla some headaches are: BYD Seal and the upcoming BYD sea lion.  The seal has good range, 0-100 km/hr time, and have a lower price than model 3.  Unlike in the USA: people in China have more choices and will cross shop. In the USA:  we can‚Äôt cross shop with model 3; and even with model y: the main competitors are: mach E, ID4, but they aren‚Äôt all produced in high numbers yet (EV6/ioniq 5 won‚Äôt qualify for tax credit right now so I don‚Äôt think it is going to compete much).  However in China: there is a lot of production from not just BYD, but also Xpeng, Nio, and many more others.  

3)  Europe: This is a mix bag. Berlin just started.  There is more competition here than before: moreso than USA, but less than China.  Cars such as Renault Megane didn‚Äôt exist 1 year ago.  VW, Stellantis, RMN, BMW are still steady with their EV sales.   For Tesla: UK and Germany is still selling Tesla quite well.  But for whatever reason France and Norway: there is some decline in sales Y-O-Y.  Berlin ramping up will answer the question to the demand in France and Norway.  Netherlands: still hasn‚Äôt recovered much.  So the biggest market right now for Europe is UK and Germany.   Electric car incentive will decrease in Germany in 2023: I don‚Äôt know how much effect it will have?? 

4) Cybertruck: still not out yet.  But this will be a North American vehicle. Too big for Europe

5) So if china demand slows down: tesla can certainly export to other markets: but the other markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (the richest countries in Asia-Australia):  I don‚Äôt think the market for Tesla will be as high as Europe.  

6) Market Cap of $644 billion today (was $1.1 trillion 1 year ago):  TSLA will have to gain 70% to get back to 1.1 trillion.  What is the difference then and now?  Then: a lot of low interest money: remember all those SPACS??  ARKK?  A lot of market exuberance and many companies didn‚Äôt trade on fundamentals.   So at today‚Äôs market cap: if tesla just grows 10% per year in market cap, TSLA be $1.3 trillion in 7 years. And in 7 years the PE will probably be 25.  That is net income of $52 billion per year.  For a car company: this is difficult.   I think all profits combined in all automotive sector ex-tesla is < $50 billion today (this is just a guess: Toyota + VW is about $30 billion)??  Last year I wrote: ‚Äúat $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap. To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???‚Äù---This year,  the question is will TSLA make $13 billion/quarter in 7 years????

7)  Again, I will reiterate that capitalism has a way for a product to find the lowest price with a given quality.  Competition creeps up slowly.  Feds have been tightening money supply with higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates and probable upcoming recession may have some effect on Tesla overall sales.  Time will tell.   

8)  I think 2023 will be the year that we will have a lot more answers to many questions: what is the intrinsic demand in Europe/is the demand really softened in France and Norway? Is the demand slowed down in China?  Also, will Tesla cut prices in China (this will affect margins)?  To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?   As of right now, there hasn‚Äôt been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory. 

9) My opinion: USA: demand won‚Äôt be an issue.  China: demand will soften. Europe: demand will soften but less so than China.  I am excited to see what 2023 brings to Tesla.

Edit: I am really unsure if tesla model y and 3 will qualify for tax credit or not (so I struck that out above).   Regardless, I don't think Tesla will have much demand problem in the USA: mainly due to not enough competitors.",t3_y8sdc4,1666293872.0,4

I am not just looking at the past and extrapolating to the future. Quite the contrary. I am basing all my future numbers on Tesla's factories, the economic environment, expected cost savings from new technologies, economies of scale, labour costs, etc., the upcoming tax incentives in the US, and more.

Comparing the cheapest IONIQ 5 with a Tesla is also very flawed comparison, as legacy OEMs have lots of options that increase the price of a car that are always included in the Tesla. Comparable models are only ~5K EUR apart (went with Euros because the Model Y Standard Range is closest in specs to the IONIQ 5, and it's not available in North-America yet since the Long Range and Performance already have too high demand), and the Tesla still has better specs. After all, there's a reason Tesla is selling 200K+ Model Ys in the US, while Hyundai is only selling 25K, yet wait times for both cars are comparable.

> As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.

Even if this happens, Tesla has pricing power to reduce prices by ~$15K and still make more money per sale than other automakers make from their EVs. And that's not even including the $10K in incentives, $2-3K in battery cost reductions, or further cost reduction from increased economies of scale. And we all know demand increases exponentially with linear price reductions.

BYD is the only other company that's demonstrated the ability to ramp up their EV production in numbers to be truly competitive and even their impact is still limited to one country (albeit the largest EV market in the world) and they're far less profitable than Tesla many times over.

So even accounting for inflated prices, Tesla dominates the US, is the only foreign EV maker that can compete in the largest EV market in the world, and still does great in Europe.

11893,it44199,t1_it3xpyf,"I agreed with a lot of the things you mentioned, and also agree demand may become a question in China. Especially with their current economic collapse. I don't see any real competition in US/Europe though, since EV demand here is starting to outstrip supply so much it's unreal. Most Western European countries are on course to hit 90% EV sales in 3-5 years. The only companies that can realistically produce that many EVs by then are Tesla and the Chinese companies. They'll own ~50% of the market if not more (6M+ sales per year).

The only point I really disagreed with is point 6. Seems to me like you're making some strange assumptions and reasoning by analogy, instead of simply looking at the net income Tesla will be able to generate and assign a PE to that to get to the market cap. Also, the comparison to car companies is always a silly one, since Tesla is a completely different company. They have way higher margins, make 60 part changes per day to each of their models where others struggle to do that much in a year, their entire factories run on AI powered self-management tools, they already earn ~5% of their automotive revenue from software sales and it's only increasing, and I could keep going on and on.

> To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory? As of right now, there hasn‚Äôt been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory.

Tesla can get to at least 5M cars a year with their current factories. Fremont is currently at 600K a year and expected to ramp to 800K over the next few years. Shanghai is at 1M and still expanding. Berlin and Texas are each larger than Shanghai and Fremont combined, and expected to do in the range of 1.5-2M cars when fully ramped.

A bit of both, but mostly the latter. ICE sales are plummeting. EV demand is increasing [(7% of consumers globally wanted to buy an EV in 2020, 12% in 2021, 20% in 2022)](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/cs_cz/topics/automotive-and-transportation/ey-mobility-consumer-index-2022-summary.pdf) exponentially. Most European countries and China are on track to hit 90%+ EVs within 3-5 years. It's a clear S-curve.

Also, there is very few real competition out there, basically just the Chinese and Korean brands. And Tesla and BYD seem to be the only two carmakers capable of scaling production sufficiently to capitalize on increased demand for EVs.

Then unfortunately you read wrong. All Model Ys will qualify (which are the most popular car), and the base Model 3 will too. Together that's 80%+ of all Teslas sold. Also, Tesla just guided all their batteries will qualify for the $45/kWh tax incentive, so that's another $2,250-4,000 cost saving for each car made depending on the model.

I think that's just reasoning by analogy and not based on data. Tesla will definitely sell every car they can make, and they're not growing slower because of economic conditions.

Annual SBC for tesla is suprisingly low, they only granted 3M split adjusted shares in options last year, and SBC has decreased significantly this year.  Stock price and ongoing employee SBC have not significantly affected dilution.

The increase in diluted share count over the last 3 quarters is primarily from the 2018 performance award that hit 3 tranches so far this year.  I don't want to go through all the math or dig through all the stock award plans, but ballpark 3/12\* 300M = 75M shares of dilution from the 3 2018 tranche awards, add 1-2M from employee compensation, subtract off a few million for falling stock price and you get roughly 60M diluted share increase from EOY 2021.",t3_y8sdc4,1666298811.0,8

That said, he still opposes the $7,500 credits because they're not necessary. People want to buy EVs without the credit. It's a waste of tax payer money. It just means Tesla will need to raise prices by ~$7,500 not to blow up demand.

Even an ICE maximalist has to admit that the Model Y beats it on basically every single metric.

Also from my experience, having driven an EV quite a lot (and not even a particularly good one, the Etron Sportback), there is no way I could ever go back to an ICE car. It's just slow, laggy, noisy, etc. It feels like you're using a flip phone to browse the internet today. Ancient tech.

> and with tesla removing sensors and relying on cameras alone to cut costs made it worse

Actually those were cut because they were leading to problems, and the data shows its become way more reliable since they removed them. They actually might be brining back an much more modern HD version of the radar soon, so it clearly had nothing to do with costs as this will be much more expensive.

> also tesla has no secret tech, the tech is out there in the open, other manufacturers are just slow to adopting it

This is true, but the wrong way of looking at it. Tesla open sourced their pattents because they're innovating so much faster that it doesn't matter. They're making 60 parts changes a day where other OEMs struggle to do that much in 2 years. As long as you're innovating faster than the rest, they can copy you all they like but they'll still be behind. Just the single-piece casting machines will take other OEMs at least 6 years to copy, and that's just their internal targets, which are usually overly optimistic.

> Also Elon himself acknowledged that Hyundai is doing well. Have you looked at Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6?

Yep, Hyundai is definitely doing well. Their only problem (outside of still being roughly as expensive as Tesla with slightly worse specs) is scale and cost. They're making so few cars, and at a cost that doesn't earn them any money on the EVs, that it's difficult to call them competition. Perhaps they can turn this around, but for now that remains to be seen.

From a stock perspective it‚Äôs attractive now, but I don‚Äôt see a future where Tesla is the Apple of EVs. And I don‚Äôt see them maintaining their margins, other manufacturers will eventually catch up since Tesla has no secret sauce as such, when google or apple productionize their ADAS systems, they will be far superior than Tesla‚Äôs. 

Tesla isn‚Äôt attracting great talent too like it used to, most of their senior engineers have left for better paying startups with better work culture, which is why you don‚Äôt see great improvements in new iterations of their cars. Tesla is becoming like legacy manufacturers, Elon is hellbent on production and cost cutting, rather than innovation because he think people will buy irrespective of the quality

12180,jdke51u,t3_12132x2,"> reddit user RevolutionaryBit9785 bought stock ticker AI because ChatGPT helped him with his homework and chatgpt is AI. Is he smart or not smart? 


ChatGPT: It's difficult to determine whether someone is ""smart"" or not based on a single action such as buying a stock. However, it's important to note that buying a stock based solely on a connection to a homework helper (in this case, ChatGPT) may not necessarily be the most informed investment decision.

It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions, taking into account factors such as the company's financial health, industry trends, and market conditions.

Overall, the decision to buy a stock ticker AI based on a connection to AI (ChatGPT) may not be the most rational approach to investing, but it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about the individual's level of intelligence based on this action alone.",t3_12132x2,1679705613.0,53

It's great to hear that OpenAI was able to help him with his homework and that he was able to apply that knowledge to real-world investing. Making profitable trades in the stock market is no easy feat, but it's clear that this guy did his research and made a smart move by investing in AI.

It's inspiring to see how technology and education can come together to help people make informed decisions and achieve financial success. It takes dedication and perseverance to learn about the stock market and make wise investments, and this guy's success is a testament to his hard work and determination. Kudos to him for taking the initiative to learn and invest wisely, and for reaping the rewards of his efforts.

The ticker AI, your chosen one, Has proved to be a goldmine won, And all who see your wealth increase, Are filled with awe and sheer amaze.

But more than this, your heart is true, You give credit where credit's due, To OpenAI, who helped you learn, And led you to this sweet return.

This diversification  not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single  sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.

Let's be real here, if you really thought AI had potential for growth in those areas, you would be loaded to the tits with calls on Philips for the first two areas you mention.  Everyone thinks they can work their AI magic on healthcare data (cough IBM's Watson cough), but when they get into the nitty gritty of it there are tons of challenges applying those models that they never imagined.  The data usually isn't even stationary, a pretty fundamental assumption for vast majority of techniques used for AI.  Performance will look good on carefully curated training and test data, but moving it into the real world with new incoming data is a different beast.  At least those that have worked in the healthcare field for a long time like Philips, know the challenges and what they're getting into.

It's what companies have been doing for years around big data and ML, just wrapped in some buzzwords that the general public is becoming aware of. I thought their comments about C3's moat were kind of spot-on. Amazon, Google, Snowflake, Palantir, etc do ""AI"" better than C3, and probably do AI better than C3. C3's competitive advantage seems to be in their ability to work with bespoke clusterfucks of data, which the others don't want to touch. Not worth the effort.

Long answer: You're right that changes in a company's revenue and pricing models can make it harder to compare financials year-over-year and understand what's going on with their receivables balance. These changes can impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, and you need to take them into account when analyzing a company's financial performance.

Concerns about revenue quality related to a growing receivables balance are valid, especially if it's due to changes in the pricing model. However, it's important to differentiate between genuine business decisions and any attempts to manipulate financial results.

Without having more in-depth information on all this, it's hard to really tell, tbh. It's ""he said, she said"" at this point - we can't know, but neither does Kerrisdale.",t3_12cecmm,1680690948.0,2

I'm also an accountant and I've never looked at C3 financials and actually getting a clear picture takes more time than I care to commit, but ""unbilled receivables"" is not usually a significant portion of sales in companies I've been exposed to.

The question about a significant portion of revenue being reported at 99% margin is a good one, and if there's a good reason for it should be easily explained. That is free money... The language from their financials about the revenue from baker Hughes being reduced by any revenue received by certain customers sounds unusual also, but if there is some kind of setup where baker Hughes is simply donating cash up to a certain amount that's reduced when c3 makes sales that should be easy to outline.

I don't know about the short seller's history and couldn't even pick them out of a line up. But what they say sounds reasonable to me at a high level without having done much research into this specific company, understanding the economics of some AI based competition, and my general accounting knowledge.

If you could have told me about the changes in the pricing model and how operationally things would be different under each approach, I might be more convinced that you truly understand the issues. Moving from a subscription to a usage pricing model does concern me; especially as the accounts receivable balances increase significantly. It suggests to me that customers aren't using the products enough and that this AI company is doing something equivalent to digital channel stuffing. 

A subscription model is less risky from a revenue quality standpoint because regardless how much the client eats, you still get your money. However, there is always the risk of overeating by some customers in a subscription model; negatively impacting margins. Additionally the risks of an increasing receivables balance right now is that financing costs are increasing because small banks like SVIB went under and bigger banks provide less favorable financing terms. Which at the very least can potentially impact margins negatively as financing costs rise and, at worst, cause a company to go bankrupt if they cannot deficit finance their operations on their journey to profitably.

My suggestion would be to do more research and reading and really be able to scrutinize this company and the questions posed by the short seller more deeply. While posting it here to Wallstreetbets is a start, you need to put this up against stronger accounting minds. Like people in r/accounting or r/tax. Because you're generally arguing with ignorant people here and most of whom will be biased towards your position because they will likely be fellow shareholders in this company.

12335,jftnrq0,t1_jfk3jss,"ChatGPT isn't an AI technology, it's a product.  Having an AI suite that calls ChatGPT, or even that runs a pre-built LLM, is like writing a browser plugin vs. building a browser.  It's a relatively paltry effort.  Hundreds of ChatGPT products are popping up from every sort of company, just the other day the Azure guys were giving a presentation about building services with the ChatGPT API at my work.  

  
The latest isn't always the greatest for everything anyway.  Transformer models are the latest fad, but they're not the latest advancements per se.  Even in the current incarnation they've been around since 2017 and the main idea goes back at least to 1992.  One of the things I hate about the machine learning field is that no one seems to read any material (perhaps because CS is so conference based... they jump from one fad to another and often mistakenly think old ideas are new).  But fair enough, they're using the new fad so I guess it does make sense for them to be part of that bubble.  

Have you actually looked at this product?  Looks like an easy and convenient way to make mistakes.  

Do you talk to Google for >90% of your searches?  If not, then why would you buy into the value add of that sort of ""natural"" interaction with technical data?  

They don't exactly make it clear where they are and are not using the generative capabilities, but anywhere that they are is inherently unreliable, so with them not being clear in their pitch about that... it isn't clear whether or not you can rely on anything there then.  At least regular ChatGPT is hooked up with Wolfram Alpha now and states when it does or does not use it.  Ok, looking at the data sheet makes things a bit more clear.  It generates a text response in the far right panel (so consider that unreliable) and generates a query for the big top panel to support the top result (which you also need to double check, that the generated query was actually appropriate).  A meta-search of your company's data resources... oooh aaah. /s  For those that haven't seen it:  [https://c3.ai/products/c3-generative-ai-product-suite/](https://c3.ai/products/c3-generative-ai-product-suite/)

It's still very much just an enterprise database wrangling tool.  Which is fine, that's their core competency.  Can we stop pretending that they do anything interesting with their AI yet?    


""Their main existing clients are energy, defense, financial.""  Are they developing more efficient solar cells with their AI?  Are they using AI for advanced target acquisition and tracking?  Are they using AI to make big bucks in algorithmic trading?  No, that's not what they do.  They make stuff for any old generic company to (hopefully) better view and understand their own data.  When I look at their ""Industries"" tab on their site it just looks like they listed every big industry.  I don't think having clients from an industry should be construed as being in that industry.  E.g. energy companies aren't in the cloud computing industry.    


Take a look at their products: [https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/)  It's all just about how they can flavor the same product to be a bit more tuned for each industry.  It's not like they work on any fundamental problems of that industry or help those companies achieve that.  They're not helping Intel or AMD with chip placement problems.  They've got a case study thing on ""Improving Drug Manufacturing Reliability and Performance.""  Do you think they made changes to the chemistry for better yield with a more reliable method?  Of course not.  They essentially worked on predicting failures, something some of my colleagues have done for a very large and well known partner.  Perhaps we should slap AI in our name (oh wait... we did do that)... but we're not a publicly traded company so we don't have any stock to inflate by doing so.  

I don't think AI will have growth in energy, defense, financial, etc... for their fundamentals.  Those aren't things C3 does.  Isn't their actual industry SaaS or PaaS?  And their competitors more like Oracle (where Siebel is from) or Salesforce or the like?    


The TLDR is... they seem fine at what they actually do.  I don't think the stock popping off on an AI bubble is particularly warranted, but most of the others doing so don't have any more merit to them either...  I might say it's AI bubble risk rather than any sort of risk particular to C3.  For C3 specific risk I would need to actually care about their financials and read the Kerisdale report...

They should be cautious with those... make sure to keep updating the models, especially since tree based models like those tend to extrapolate poorly if they hit anything outside their domain.  For some applications where the data is more stationary, they'll be fine, but for other applications the drifting means may eventually become big problems.  I'm a bit surprised that they used a depth of just 5 with over 700 features... makes me think the vast majority of them are unnecessary and there is very little interaction.  With models under 100 features I have sometimes found a depth of 14 to have the best performance on the test data.  I'm not saying all data would be complex enough for 14, few cases would be, but 5... off the top of my head I think 5 is the default value so I wonder how much they explored.  In some of their cases studies they cite running hundreds of ML models though... so who knows.  Granted, it's not a new article, but I don't think C3's approach has fundamentally changed.",t3_12cecmm,1681218964.0,2

The letter's main issue is C3's high growth in accounts receivable, which they deem ""suspicious"" for a tech growth company. However, this isn't unusual, and Kerrisdale's own research points to the long product cycle as a plausible explanation for this phenomenon.

Again: without knowing all the details, nobody knows. The auditor does, and C3. However, it makes Kerrisdale appear sloppy/desperate or dishonest/desperate, in my eyes, at least.

TL;DR: Kerrisdale publicly points out something that the auditor is having an eye on, regardless, as it's a position with strong growth, despite delivering a perfectly plausible explanation to said anomaly in their own research.

Here's what I make of it:

\- Starting from a specific date, the money Baker Hughes owes to C3.ai will be reduced by the amount C3.ai makes from some of their customers.

\- Under the new contract, Baker Hughes will pay C3.ai more frequently, get broader reseller rights, and C3.ai will offer more products and services. This change increases the overall money involved in the deal.

\- If Baker Hughes performs exceptionally well and surpasses certain goals, they may need to pay C3.ai even more.

Overall, I'd say it's a difficult read, but it's an SEC filing, not a children's book.

This kind of language isn't unusual by any stretch of the imagination, and for Kerrisdale to say that they don't know what C3 is saying here, is pretty dishonest IMO. Of course, they know, or their opinion on this matter should be disregarded, as they obviously wouldn't know what they're doing.

 >A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

12543,irejc5j,t3_xxvy03,Meta's key competitors are TikTok and Apple imo.,t3_xxvy03,1665150168.0,83
12544,irelgh2,t3_xxvy03,">Meta‚Äôs key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. 

fucking LOL this guy doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, meta to zero",t3_xxvy03,1665151215.0,92
12545,irepeqc,t3_xxvy03,"I don't agree with some parts of this.  


For one, this article is way too focused on 'META', and not enough on how META makes money.  


Advertising on Facebook and Instagram is incredibly profitable for businesses, particularly in the e-Commerce sector.  


It would be a mistake to assume that LinkedIn is a threat to Facebook in any major way. Facebook's bread and butter does not have a HUGE overlap with LinkedIn. Two completely different platforms that cater to different segments.  


I would wager that the biggest threats to Facebook are YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon.  


Particularly Tiktok and Amazon.  


Facebook has co-existed with YouTube advertising for a long time, but TikTok is projected to capture [$12 billion in advertising spend](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/tiktok-becomes-cash-machine-with-revenue-tripling-to-12-billion).  


Similarly, [Amazon has captured $32 billion in ad revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-has-a-31-billion-a-year-advertising-business.html).  


The reason for why I believe Amazon and Tiktok are greater threats to META is the following:  


A very big part of the advertisers on META are e-commerce brands. The same audience that is attractive to e-commerce advertisers is the same audience that would be targeted by TikTok & Amazon.  


For example:  


If I am a service-focused local advertiser (home remodelers, junk yards, plumbers, etc...) - Google is going to be my bread and butter. Although I don't have any insight, having worked in digital advertising for a long time, I can tell you that what these local service businesses make on Google would be hard to beat elsewhere.  


I don't imagine that Facebook has ever done well in this sector and never would have.  


The reason being that if a plumber targets you with an ad on Facebook but nothing in your house is broken, then you're simply not going to convert. On the other hand, if something in your house DOES break, your almost immediate reaction is to go to Google and look up a plumber. And that's where Google excels, and always has.  


And what are the chances that an ad on Facebook reaches you the immediate second that something breaks? Or that you remember that a month ago you had seen an ad on Facebook for a plumbing service?  


Facebook's bread and butter are consumer brands. And these same consumer brands are the ones who are most likely to go to TikTok to reach those audiences. Why is my guess for why YouTube is pushing Shorts, and META is pushing Reels.  


They don't want to lose that specific audience segment.  


Similarly, if Amazon can improve their advertising algorithms enough so that sellers on its platforms can see greater returns on investment, that proves a very strong challenge to Facebook who would see diminished advertising on its platform from Amazon sellers.  


The growth and effectiveness on YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon are then what I believe to be the biggest threats to META's ad revenue.  


I agree that META should have long diversified more (Alphabet makes 80% of its revenue from online advertising vs. META's 99%) but that's a different topic.  


The reason why I believe people should focus more on META's future as a go-to platform for online advertising is because the online advertising market is expected to grow to $1 trillion dollars in size by 2027, compared to $500 billion (roughly) as it is today.  


If META can continue to capture at least 20% of the total market, that would put its revenue at around $200 billion in the next 5 years.  


But this would be imagining that the company does NOTHING but try to keep up which I don't think is true of the platform, overall. The META execs are not silly and I would imagine their revenue figures would exceed $200 billion before 2027, which would make it significantly more valuable than \~ $150's per share.

12547,ire81wp,t3_xxvy03,"This sub doesn't deserve your level of skill and talent. But thanks for sharing. I have been interested in learning how to make all these projections for stock value, but never got the time to start. Will try to learn from the google docs link, how to code this stuff in Python.

As for Meta/Facebook, I think they are going to end up being one of those, ""too early for their time"", *plus* the fact that their business model is a bit more parasitic and harmful to society than other social media services. Facebook made the smart decision to consolidate as much presence as possible in social sphere with Instagram and Whatsapp acquisitions, but it made a huge mistake going so blindly into this whole Metaverse hype.

Metaverse as a concept is still very new and with very limited *real*, valuable applications. I would rather have a Zoom meeting with *actual, real* people than their cartoonish avatars. Wearing the Oculus headset for even an hour is not going to be an enjoyable experience. There is very little incentive for serious use of Meta in business of any kind. It's not providing crucial tech for AR/MR that might be at least useful for more creative enterprises or simulating engineering problems that can actually be used by companies. And Meta's Metaverse has proven itself how underdeveloped and useless it really is for any ""fun"" socialising (those dead Meta eyes from Zuckerberg's avatar still haunt me).

It's just hype. Pure and simple hype. A social media company who's only USP was once, ""it is cool"", is now just a frothing, seething swamp of extremist propaganda and people who grew old with the website. Zuckerberg had way too much executive control here without check. He could've rather focussed on making facebook are more serious hub for older generation with some constructive contribution to society: better source validation for news articles, fixing the buggy/bloated Video/Audio Messenger, developing the Marketplace into a more complete and serious business platform. They had the right demographic for that, Marketplace has good use in Asian countries at least. They could've taken the existing billions of user base and focussed on becoming a platform for small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs, like how Youtube is still relevant by providing a serious streaming platform for content creators -- despite all the controversy with its business/payment model, it still is relevant!",t3_xxvy03,1665143834.0,36

- your whole content creation thing is wrong. They had roughly 10 years to do something about it. They've tried and don't seem to either succeed or want to succeed.

Maybe that's their big problem: what is PayPal? I think it's hard to make the case that they are in the level of V or MA. Those are juggernaut companies. So maybe a low to mid teens multiple is suitable for pypl? If they really find a way to monetize Venmo, I could see the argument for more.

12688,jjwm4sk,t3_13fmsz4,"I own a small position in PYPL, I probably won‚Äôt sell it at this level but I probably won‚Äôt buy more either. The company is cheap for a reason, I don‚Äôt know how much they will grow into the future, but this company wouldn‚Äôt be a bad zombie company. The problem with financial companies is there is very little margin because there is hyper competition and low barrier to entry. 

When I bought PYPL over a year ago I viewed it as PayPal is the company that you use for online shopping when you don‚Äôt want to give your credit card out to every website. I did not see Apple Pay coming as a competitor in this aspect, today I see pay with credit card, pay with PayPal, pay with Apple Pay. Both will satisfy this security concern and I don‚Äôt see any advantage to paying with PayPal vs Apple Pay. 

The reason I still hold it is that I don‚Äôt think they will decline revenues/profit, they just won‚Äôt grow like they used to and a 14 P/FCF isn‚Äôt a bad price to pay for them. Plus from what I have heard PayPal charges a high payment processing fee, it‚Äôs a good position to be in where the buyer chooses the method and the seller pays the fee, if the seller gets a lot of purchases through PayPal they may be hesitant to switch to a cheaper option. I expect this to go down eventually as competition picks up, but for now and the next couple years they can have the higher premium.",t3_13fmsz4,1683916543.0,4

12691,jjz2ama,t3_13fmsz4,"Pushed bard to make a best guess on where the stock is headed:

My best guess is that PayPal stock will go up in the long term. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and mobile payments. PayPal is also investing heavily in new growth areas, such as cryptocurrency and BNPL, which could help the company to maintain its competitive edge.
However, there are some risks that could affect PayPal's stock price in the short term. The company is facing increasing competition from other payment providers, and it is also seeing slower growth in its core e-commerce business. Additionally, PayPal is investing heavily in new growth areas, which could weigh on the company's profitability in the near term.
Overall, I believe that PayPal is a good long-term investment. The company has a strong track record of innovation and growth, and it is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and mobile payments.

First and foremost, the growth has just slowed. You‚Äôre showing revenue and EPS numbers from 2018, but market is forward looking. 1% user growth and 6% revenue growth? That‚Äôs slow for a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù company. What‚Äôs actually happened is this stock is in limbo. It‚Äôs not growing fast enough for growth investors, not cheap enough for value investors. It‚Äôs maturing, and it‚Äôs usual investors don‚Äôt like that. 

The markets concern is that the business getting commoditized. Go to any online check out, you have a credit card option, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google pay, Amazon pay, Square, Afterpay, Zelle‚Ä¶etc etc. So many players (not to mention massive players) in this space offer the exact same thing, with no tangible advantage. In fact, Apple Pay is easiest and the one most people use now. Instead of logging into my PayPal account, I can pay by clicking my lock button twice and using FaceID.

My best guess is that the most likely company to acquire PayPal is Amazon. Amazon is a tech giant with a strong focus on e-commerce. PayPal's payment processing capabilities would allow Amazon to expand its e-commerce offerings and reach new customers. Additionally, PayPal's strong brand and customer base would give Amazon a competitive edge in the global payments market.

Here are some reasons why Amazon might be interested in acquiring PayPal:

* PayPal is a leading player in the global payments market, with over 392 million active accounts. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon a significant increase in market share.
* PayPal has a strong customer base of over 392 million active accounts. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon access to a large and loyal customer base.
* PayPal operates in over 200 countries and territories. Acquiring PayPal would give Amazon a global reach.
* PayPal is a profitable company with a strong track record of growth. Acquiring PayPal would improve Amazon's financial performance.

Of course, there are also some risks associated with acquiring PayPal. These risks include:

* High price tag: PayPal is a valuable company, and its acquisition would likely be expensive.
* Integration challenges: Integrating PayPal's operations and systems could be challenging.
* Regulatory scrutiny: Acquiring PayPal could attract regulatory scrutiny.

Overall, the decision of whether or not to acquire PayPal is a complex one. There are both potential benefits and risks associated with the acquisition. Amazon should carefully consider all of these factors before making a decision.",t3_13fmsz4,1683962422.0,2

Stack Overflow recently banned ChatboGPT answers on its forum due to gross inaccuracy. This is the problem when non-experts first encounter these types of programs. The answers appear like they *could* be correct, but in fact are not. 

If you ask Chatbot about the best beaches in Mexico, the program is very good at scraping somebody's travel blog to spit out an answer that's more or less correct. It may even be able to write a Shakespeare-like play by scanning his corpus and ""predicting"" what might make sense within that context. 

But if you ask Chatbot if Warren Buffett is a better investor than Jim Cramer (as somebody [actually did](https://twitter.com/qcapital2020/status/1600615706772766720) on Twitter), which requires analysis and critical thinking, the program is completely stumped.

On one hand I was very impressed by the bot overall. It can already provide an alternative for people who just use Google for cursory information about a topic and it can generate custom boilerplate.  I was also able to get the bot to recommend a design pattern I should use based on a problem I put in the prompt.  The design pattern recommended was not applicable, but I was impressed nonetheless and provided feedback to help it improve.


However, the bot has a lot of filters and it provided very high level answers to my attempts to get it to break down a case study by basically telling me more research would need to be performed.  I agree with your point about critical thinking, an inherent limitation is that the bot can't ""choose"" a solution in an open-ended prompt.

This is Chatgpt's answer: 

Yes, Warren Buffett is generally considered to be a better investor than Jim Cramer. Buffett is one of the most successful and well-known investors in the world, with a long track record of generating impressive returns for his investors. He is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that owns a diverse portfolio of companies, and has a net worth of over $100 billion.  
  
In contrast, Jim Cramer is a television host and financial analyst who is known for his energetic and sometimes controversial investment advice. While he has a strong following and has achieved some success as an investor, he is not on the same level as Buffett in terms of investment performance and net worth.  
  
Overall, while both Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer are well-known figures in the world of investing, Buffett is widely regarded as the better investor of the two.

That's not a very useful question though. I think it's value is in being an additional tool to help professionals when asking technical questions, not about opinions.

For instance, when I ask it to write me an example program in a badly documented library, it produces a fully buildable example that is much easier to understand than the snippets of code with no context that exist online. When asking it to solve specific novel tasks it has saved me a few hours of Googling and experimenting, which is well worth it.

Netflix offers online streaming and that's also extremely scalable at very little marginal cost per user but very high marginal profit

I went from using it couple times a month, to a few times a year. As to the cost, my special needs adult son had a job that was less than 4 miles from our house.

To be fair the value is backed by profits, but the growth forecasts are all unrealistic and they will all fail or be replaced by foreign competitors before they will grow enough to pay back current lofty share prices which in some of these companies cases mean they would need to make profits for 60 years straight just to justify current share prices. (they are quite lofty and the world would in no universe grow that fast) The world isn't growing fast enough for their growth to justify their prices and it's that simple, and the next decade will likely be a continuation of highly competitive asset classes that will pull money from these companies market caps as higher interest rates become impossible to be put back into the box.

Uber disrupted taxis and eventually the food industry with Uber Eats. Customers ride in decent vehicles and get food/supplies at home. Merchants supply food or items without physical customers. Drivers create their own schedule and work as much (or as little) as they want. 

Covid brought the economy to its knees and Uber played a significant role in minimizing the blow. They employed drivers, while merchants stayed in business and users were able to get food and supplies without exposing to Covid. 

Those are powerful intangibles. While the business model may not be profitable yet, they unlocked untapped value through smartphones.

Why are there so many AI/ChatGPT ""experts"" who don't understand what they're talking about?

I'm going to assume you are not a SWE and you do not understand how ChatGPT functions. From your profile, it appears that you're a truck driver. ChatGPT does not have the ability to create original code. It writes code based on training data. Ask it yourself. Here is the response,



> ChatGPT is a language model that can generate text based on the examples it has been trained on and the context provided by the input. While it can generate code snippets, it does not have the ability to create original code or understand the logic or meaning behind the code it generates. It can only generate code based on patterns and examples it has seen during its training. It is not capable of understanding the purpose or function of the code it generates, or how it might be used in a larger program.

Can you understand some of its limitations now?

> Yes it is. You know it is.

It is not. I know it is not. 

> You even said it is.

I never said that. 

> You said it can't make source code then later say welllll it's context dependant.

I said ChatGPT is not able to successfully translate **""any idea""** into source code. It has complexity limits and it cannot generate original code. Even at lower complexity levels, it routinely generates non-functional code. 

> I'm responding to your incorrect statement

I didn't make an incorrect statement.

> The bottom line is ChatGPT can make code out of basically anything you ask. Will it work? Sometimes. Will it be well made? Doesn't matter.

lol? Non-functional code is useless. Whether or not it's well made absolutely matters. Am I being punkd here?

> The answer is that right now it can solve some small problems and someday it will solve big problems

Exactly! There are problems it cannot solve, thus confirming that it cannot produce code for **any idea**. Self aware much?

The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

I don't see anyone behaving pretentiously. I stated this because your comments reflect that you do not understand how ChatGPT functions, and your history indicates that you're a truck driver. I do so cautiously, since assuming is a bad habit. 

Why are you writing so confidently about something you so clearly do not understand? You don't find that odd?

> Never said it didn't have limitations. You are just building a straw man to attack.

This doesn't make sense. Are you aware of the original statement that we're discussing? OP claimed that ChatGPT can successfully write code for **any** idea/application. 

> Yes, this ALL would be covered under the part of my response that said it could make source code that might not work or not be of good quality. So I still stand correct and you are just moving the goal post.

Mate, this is a really dumb comment. If the code does not work, than it's not ""successful"" and the code is useless. My infant daughter can write code that doesn‚Äôt work too! There are no goalposts being moved. No need for silly idioms. 

> The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

Okay, clearly you have no idea what the topic is. No one has questioned whether ChatGPT can produce **any** code. OP suggested that it can code **ANYTHING**, which is false. You can ask ChatGPT this yourself. I posted the response, which you somehow managed to entirely avoid.

> You can dance around this 100 times and 100 times you will still be wrong. It CAN produce source code. You are wrong.

No one said ChatGPT cannot produce code. Are you high as fuck or something? You don't seem to be aware of what we're talking about.

It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

 >A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.

**TL;DR -**  

The post discusses expected earning reports of five different companies, namely CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Salesforce (CRM), C3.ai (AI), Okta (OKTA), and Nordstrom (JWN), outlining their recent performances, anticipated challenges, and future projections based on industry trends. The author offers a bullish stance on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA, while expressing skepticism towards JWN.

### Facts

* üìà CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is predicted to report an increase in earnings, driven by the rising demand for its products due to heightened global security needs. However, increased R&D and sales/marketing expenses might impact its bottom line.
* üåê Salesforce (CRM) is expected to post significant earnings, nearly double compared to the previous year, thanks to its strategically built digital transformation portfolio. However, macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and geopolitical issues could pose challenges.
* üß† C3.ai (AI) is benefiting from the growing interest in artificial intelligence, with its stock having more than doubled recently. The company is expanding its product portfolio and partnerships, which is expected to boost its Q4 revenues.
* üîê Okta (OKTA) is predicted to report earnings growth compared to losses in the same quarter last year. The increased use of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio are expected to drive its profits.
* üõçÔ∏è Nordstrom (JWN) is expected to report a decline in earnings, reflecting reduced consumer spending amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite efforts to enhance customer experience and technology advancement, high markdowns are likely to impact its gross margin.",t3_13wrcad,1685557773.0,15

Alright, buckle up, folks, 'cause it's time for FictionCorp's epic earnings call! Today, we're gonna blow your fucking minds with our AI extravaganza. We're on a mission to outdo NVIDIA in the AI name-dropping game, 'cause we ain't afraid to show off our AI prowess, baby!

So, let's dive right in and talk about our revolutionary AI-powered products and solutions. We've infused AI into every damn nook and cranny of our operations. We're talking AI-powered widgets, AI-driven doodads, and even AI-controlled underpants (yep, you heard that shit right!). We're all about that AIception, where we use AI to do AI of AI while sipping on our 69th cup of coffee for the day. It's pure genius, I tell ya!

Our AI-driven revenue has skyrocketed like a rocket-powered unicorn on steroids. We've hit the magical 420 mark, and it ain't just the stoners who are impressed. Our AI algorithms have become the talk of the town, like the popular kids in high school who always get the best parking spots. From predicting stock market trends to optimizing avocado toast recipes (we're hipster-friendly), our AI-powered platform does it all.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Is FictionCorp just slapping the AI label on everything to ride the trend? Hell no! We take our AI shit seriously. Our team of brainiacs, who wear lab coats as fashionable attire, have been sweating their asses off to make our AI algorithms smarter than a supercomputer on steroids. We're transforming the world one ""AI"" at a time, making Elon Musk's neuralink experiments look like child's play.

But wait, there's more! We've also developed an AI assistant named SnarkyBot (inspired by yours truly, I might add) that responds with 50% more sarcasm and swears than the average assistant. Need someone to insult you while answering your questions? SnarkyBot's got your back.

So, in conclusion, FictionCorp is dominating the AI game, like a boss. We've crushed the AI mention count of those NVIDIA amateurs with our 69th generation AI technology. We're turning dreams into reality, one ""AI"" at a time, while keeping the shareholders rolling in the green like a 420-themed casino. So, strap in and join us on this wild AI ride, because we're about to blow your fucking minds! Thank you and fuck yeah!",t3_13seeyy,1685163988.0,3

Of course it could grow and make a bigger share, but it could just as well go down. ChatGPT is a high-risk investment with potencial high reward but most probably it will go down. If the mean expectation would be different, then the investment would be different as well. That is how investments in this league are executed. 10 billion is a fair price by definition. Both the company and the market keep it simple: a 10 billion investment is worth 10 billion until it has proven otherwise.

To be fair Microsoft has integrated other companies rather well over the last 35 years. But those strategic synergies are priced in of course. They have been priced in before ChatGPT was founded. That's why Microsoft's earning's ratio is higher than most companies.

An investment theory must be based on the market. That the *fair price* is for some reason wrong. That some specific circumstance is not accurately priced in yet. So investing in microsoft (or anywhere else) should not happen on the theory ""ChatGPT will perform well."".

However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, OpenAI has not gone public. The decision to go public is typically influenced by various factors, such as the company's growth plans, financial considerations, and the preferences of its stakeholders. These factors can change over time, and it's best to refer to the latest news and announcements from OpenAI or reliable sources to get the most up-to-date information on their plans regarding going public.",t3_13pqjz7,1684853993.0,3

A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.

Stocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.

Bonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship‚Äîwhen demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease.",t3_13u0n86,1685307775.0,2

On the M15 chart, our trading range is between 422.92 and 419.78, with the current trade happening in the upper part of this range. We have a Fair Value Gap (FVG) of 420.75 to 422.04 which could be filled if we notice a shift in trend at 421.94. If such a trend shift occurs, I'll search for chances to buy in the discount zone and at the 15-minute order block (420.49 - 419.78). Bullish investors must maintain the price above 419.21. If the price drops below 419.21, we'll focus on the hourly Fair Value Gaps and order block.

Buy-side Discounts:

* 421.34 (50%)
* 420.97 (62%)
* 420.72 (70%)
* 420.44 (79%)
* 419.78(100%). 

Targets: 

* 422.92 (0%) (T.P. 1)
* 413.77 (-27%) (T.P. 2)
* 424.87 (-62%) (T.P. 3)
* I plan to set out today if it runs and catch it to the downside.  Here is what I'm looking at, though.

AMD have branched out into both markets and have tried to use this to get people to buy an AMD CPU and GPU (if you have both they can share memory and work better.) although NVDA are working on a CPU which would remove the advantage AMD has with its smart memory.

AMD won this round in the datacenter sector. Intel won in the consumer sector. Healthy competition is great. 

I never trashed AMD. 

I said the stock has a PE ratio double that of intel, and that INTC is a better stock buy. AMD is overvalued compared to INTC. AMD needs 100% growth in earnings and to stay at its current stock price to be an equally valueable purchase as INTC stock. 

The company is doing great right now and thats all well and good. But these metrics exist for a reason. Not knowing this shit is why people are suprised when TSLA tanks after earnings reports that show good news. Because when the company grows by 10% and its PE ratio suggests a priced in 800% growth, that 10% growth reported on earnings is actually terrible.",t3_zrkv2i,1671646403.0,4
14461,j1ioudw,t1_j1icbpn,"Of course not. But revenues do not maintain those kinds of shifts in growth/decline either. Particularily in a scenario like this one. 

Two companies dominate the same market with little to no outside competition. One company, the smaller of the two rolls out a successful line of product while the other has a botched release and a 10 month delay. The smaller company grabs up a disproportionately large portion of the market share during that time. 

So yes on paper the smaller co posts high percentage growth, while the other posts decline. Thats all well and good. 

But it would be very foolish to assume that those numbers on paper will maintain the elevated growth/decline. AMD will not beat INTCs chips every round, and INTC will not have catastrophic production problems every round either. Also, rest assured they will be out for blood with AMD up their ass, and likely will be pushing their tech to the absolute limit in the coming cycles rather than the relaxed slow drip theyre used to doing without competition. 

anyway, AMD had a disproportionately good year, and INTC had a bad one. Alot of factors go into that whole battle, and I dont think it is a smart move to buy the top of the more speculative of the two. If AMD doesnt maintain the big growth the stock comes crashing down even on good earnings, because speculative investers are assuming to repeat those 40% increases in revenue. And rest assured, they WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT maintain 40% revenue growth for too long.No company can. It was a perfect storm for them to get there. If they come in with one ER showing only a modest 5% growth, the stock implodes. Thats the nature of overvalued growth stocks.

I do not hold positions in either of these stocks. If I were to make a play, I would wait for INTC to rollout their new datacenter chips early January, which will officially fall very short of beating AMDs recent release. INTC. Will likely take a big hit and if so I would either go long long INTC on the drop, or long dated puts AMD if it pumps more.",t3_zrkv2i,1671904864.0,1

EDIT: I should elaborate a bit. In the past, the AI winters were preceded by the actual academic goalposts (not the fucking marketing!) being placed boldly in the sand, and then missing spectacularly. It was driven by academics.

In contrast, what we have now is more of a possible AI bubble. The academic goalposts are being SMASHED, year after year for about 8 years now.

The marketing has gotten a bit ahead of itself. But the technology landscape this time is truly different, unlike last times.

If you're copy-pasting chatGPT code, then you're one bad programmer. Writing the code for, ""Hello World"" in ""literally any language"" != being a programmer in any language. If you had paid attention, you'll see that most codes spouted by GPT is still usually wrong. The more complex the task, the worse the quality. It messes up simple image recognition code for a neural networks, you have to tell it what it did wrong and then *maybe* it will get things right, if it ever does. It *almost always* cites completely wrong literature, betraying the flaws of its current architecture, a probability machine ""with attention"". Even after repeatedly being told that the citations were completely wrong, it never corrected itself and was stuck in a loop of wrong DOIs and fabricated paper titles/author names. And GPT 3 was trained on data till September 2021, so it's not really that outdated. It's still a machine trained on data, and even with 45 TB of training data, it falls short of emulating human expertise significantly.

There is still a long way to go, and there will always be need of an expert to supervise what GPT or any other LLM construes as a ""logical, coherent"" sentence, whether human or programming languages. It is good for, ""having conversations"" with chat bots. But it's nowhere near being a substitute for an expert or human creativity. Could easily be a decade or at least 5 years away. When they release GPT 4, we'll see how far its logical inference has improved - and I am using that term generously in context of a LLM.",t3_12dz6w5,1680864918.0,6

Their recent performance with 12th gen / 13th gen and Battlemage shows more mediocrity. Maybe now that they have been losing for \~3-4 years things will change enough to turn around in 3 years.

At the same time you have companies like Disney and Netflix introducing ad-supported options which means fewer ad dollars to go around for everyone else.

I do think the company is interesting, especially to average down soon. But feels like we can't rely on the spending making a turnaround, he might go full steam ahead even in a big recession.

I thought like $150 ish was a safe price, thinking the company could run really lean in a recession. But I'm realizing Meta has barely ever even operated in a severe recession. They might not know how and Zuck controlling spending is not a good look.",t3_ylid36,1667558391.0,2

$amd ran ~30% on a bombshell that nvidia is skullfucking them.  i don't know how anyone could see nvda's er/q2 guide and think it's good for amd.  amd already guided.  

amd's event yesterday was a commercial for nvidia.  they claimed a $30B 2023 TAM and then said they won't have products til 2024.

amd has no software.  it's cuda vs... open source.

the first bunch of mi300s are headed to el capitan for low margin.

they refused to show any benchmarks vs the h100, so the performance is still a big unknown.

amd also just wasted ~90% of the presentation talking about epyc, which is now basically rendered moot.  epyc is the superior datacenter cpu... but datacenter is now pulling a 180 and switching to being gpu-centric, via the ai play.

You don't need to have major explosive upheaval and ""automated everything"" to move the needle significantly. Just look at the above trend growth of the 90s. It's not a coincidence that was also a time of rapid adoption and accessible tech use in the office--with a computer on every single desk for the first time.

If Lotus 1-2-3 and Word Perfect can move the needle, then autogenerating reems of usable content, legal analysis and customer support chat conversations will move the needle even more, even if you need the same number of people to check everything over.

There are a lot of implications and concerns. I don't expect utopia. And more than unemployment and social upheaval I wonder what the world will be like in 10 years if large chunks of our very culture are auto-generated then edited by a human. We're already swimming in too much content--what happens when every idiot with a laptop can post reasonable sounding erudite essays about whatever crazy notion they have at 3am?

Human beings are incredibly adept at survival, adapting when it is absolutely necessary. 

The civil war originally started over the rise of industrialism and the war over agriculture. Slavery didn‚Äôt become an apparent part of the war (it was always hidden within the context of agriculture- one couldn‚Äôt imagine the other) until much later. 

When the manufacturing assembly line was created, everyone was afraid they would be out of jobs forever. The same with a dozen other inventions before and after the rise of mass manufacturing. 

Instead, human beings adapted. Their new reality gave rise to more creativity, which birthed new ideas. The free-time created by machines (computers included) led to more jobs, more inventions and a higher quality of life. 

The same will be true of AI. It will have it‚Äôs limitations, like all things. We just don‚Äôt know what those are yet. The newly recaptured income from deploying AI will increase development of new projects and ideas. Businesses will expand and with it, so will costs. 

While I think investing in companies that have a vision for their future is wise, an investment based mostly on the use of AI is a bit short-sighted. 

If you listen to Microsoft‚Äôs Q1 guidance call it is apparent that Satya had every hope that AI would save the day - but he wasn‚Äôt sure that it would. Eventually, the CFO had to cut him off before his doubt and uncertainty in the immediate financial future of the company became contagious. 

AI has a long ways to go before it‚Äôs utility can be fully realized, and along side it businesses will be growing and developing new ideas that will change the landscape of our everyday lives.

(Turned out her intestines were twisting and she would have died from it had her mum not kept persisting something else was up) Eventually they take her mum seriously Lads procedure, sorted. 

Fast forward 20 years, she's getting violent sick episodes unable to keep food down, constant vomitting for hours. Multiple episodes. Multiple GP/doctor's visits...

Not a single doctor or GP over a period of 3 years could even put 2 and 2 together even when we explicitly asked if it could be related ... GUESS WHAT MOTHAFUCKA! her intestines were twisting... like read her fucking notes. I'm an engineer and when something goes wrong do you know what I check first? All the shit that failed last time. 

Doctors are just like everyone else. It always amazes me how doctors put themselves on pedastals when in reality they go learn a bunch of shit, and end up using none of it, or they become a GP and become a glorified gatekeeper of medical care. Most doctors are doing the same as everyone else; looking at the clock waiting for the bell to ring so they can go home. 

I'd have taken any kind of diagnosis for my partner over the bullshit we were fed, it got to the point I just started doing the research myself. Becaus it was clear the trained doctors weren't capable of solving this one.

You went and learnt a bunch of info, regurgitated it in an exam, got a certificate that calls you a doctor and now you sit and gatekeep medical care by applying basic knowledge to a complex system (a body). Tell me what about that isn't replaceable by an AI? 

And finally, isn't people trying to diagnose their own issues actually what you want anyway? So you really think we can train enough GPs to actually provide decent medical care to a massively growing population? GPs jobs is to stop people going up to hospital with non real issues.

GPT models are not just searching for information in their training data to answer a query, they are generating new outputs based on representations that they've learned from the training process.

But to state we shouldn't do something because of a very wishy washy concern that we don't even know or understand to be true.... Vs. Accepting it is coming and begining to prepare for it.... Dunno. Just the way I am. If you think humans won't be involved in the new tech.... Then you have WAY more faith in AI than I do. AI will take way longer than your thinking to come to fruition, along the way it will have revolutionised so many other aspects of life. 

For example. Your just a brick layer, no qualifications, little prospects... Along comes a bit of tech that will optimise the growth of a home vegetable patch, it will produce high quality food without the chance you as a human are going to fuck it up through misuse/management. Now how complex do you think that tech is? It's not. It's a camera, it's probably some servos, a CPU and an internet connection. It really isn't all that AI, it's not wildly expensive and it's not wildly complex. Yet, now with a small garden, maybe even some vertical wall growing spots your able to produce almost all of your own veg for consumption. All of a sudden the need to work a 9-5 is reduced because your basic needs are better serviced than today. 

Point being; there have been many many instances of the exact thing your fear mongering about throughout history. To think this is the only thing that is 'multi-industry *changing*' imo is naive. 

I do think AI replacing basic work roles is a potential problem. I'm just not enough to think that AI will progress so fast that entire workforces are laid off en masse. Society has, and never will operate that rapidly. Look at anything and everything humans have ever made and I think that's enough evidence to back that claim. 

It will start with basic services, service chats, the routine scheduling of 'things'. It will begin to take over Q&A more than it already does it, and humans will forever be fearful of it fucking up and will train and retain people to manage these new systems. The people growing up will begin to work with systems from a younger age and we will have humans that are far more capable of complex interactions with AI related industries while losing more simplistic knowledge of things the AIs now control. The advent of more and more mechanical and electrical systems will require more and more maintenance, instead of an expendible employee (because why does a company care if you die? Other tha profit loss) you'll have machines that require servicing, commissioning and maintaining. All of that could eventually also be done by AIs right? Sure. But that too will take huge amounts of time and resources; even if AIs do half the work.

TLDR: the workforce your worried about being laid off in some short timeframe are far more likely to laid off over a much longer period of time, the working lifetime of a human is like 40-50 years. If it takes 20 years to integrate AI that's half the working life of a singular person. In that timeframe younger generations will already have much different career paths and will be choosing those.

>TL;DR: MSFT is a good investment because they are doing well in the AI space, have a strong partnership with Walmart, and are on the path to acquiring Activision Blizzard.",t3_10guyv7,1674215320.0,1

15108,j577knb,t3_10guyv7,Thoughts on earnings on 24th?  have (4) 240 calls exp 2/17... currently just about even on them as i bought my first 2 calls on the ChatGPT news earlier this week. Clippy 2.0 here we come baby!!!,t3_10guyv7,1674251396.0,5
15109,j57j0re,t3_10guyv7,"I'm well into a decade buying msft and won't stop anytime soon, while they are up in the air over hololens 3 still, the fact they are pushing in so many realistic and intelligent directions that will position them well for the next decade while their competitors flounder around and fail project after project just makes me buy more. I think their commercial applications for augmented reality solves a lot of the ""work at home"" issues (interaction with co workers, sharing of workflows/data etc) while realistically heading in the only evenitable direction for the future of humanity.. that of the work at home environment (in a lot of industries). It's wildly inefficient to make people drive in to a large office you have to pay to heat, pay for electricity, pay property tax on, etc etc etc when eventually tech like hololens will make all the benefits redundant.    Which will imo also fuel one of the hugest societal shifts in human history, the shift back to smaller communities and away from condensed city life,because if you can work effectively remotely, then you can hire the best candidate from across the world, or likewise you can work for the best company.. there's no point in paying obscene rent to live in a closet for that when you can get a much nicer property in a smaller town with all the required amenities for much cheaper,and livea much happier existence. 
  
That is the most efficient and cost effective way forward imo, which is typically the route that ends up being taken.. likely decades away but the fact management sees that and is making an allowance for it already makes me bullish AF.  
  
They have so many 5head plays it's honestly incredible.. unlike google who keeps dropping the ball with their projects, Microsoft seems to be nailing it and even in their failures they pivot to a strength;. 
  
When Xbox One was first coming out it got a lot of bad press because it was supposed to have a mandatory ""always online"" feature.. but what wasn't reported that much was that was part of a new market system Microsoft was creating so users could buy and sell their digital game licenses. You buy the game online, play it, then sell it to someone else.. Microsoft of course would get a cut, but you as the consumer would have an opportunity to sell your game licenses.    Of course publishing studios lost their shit and started a huge ad campaign to destroy it, and they capitulated, but that was the groundwork for what became game pass, which has been a huge success so far, as well as their ""play anywhere"" forced game license sharing across all their platforms much to the chagrin of many publishers.   
  
Incredibly well positioned company with great leadership.",t3_10guyv7,1674256044.0,3

15119,j57o49q,t3_10guyv7,"MS is crushing it with subscription based services. Very very strong cash flows. They are mature, well diversified and have deep enterprise roots that are hard to get away from. Office 365 is pretty much the global standard for messaging. Heck we laugh at clients forced to use gsuite because of the short falls in it.

I think the push MS is making into gaming is raising regulatory eyebrows now, not sure they will be allowed to build a monopoly position and frankly they should not be allowed to anyway.

Its a very strong company. One of the strongest.

What I dont like its its low div yield. 1.15%

15189,jlej4mv,t3_13qcug9,"SHOP is a little expensive right now, but a way better long-term investment than FVRR imo.

 I've used FVRR quite a bit in the past for simple design work, but I doubt I'll be doing that much anymore with AI getting so good. Plus FVRR is also overpriced imo. Their growth looks disgusting and unless that reaccelerates it's hard to justify the current valuation. Just way too many risks.",t3_13qcug9,1684918847.0,10
15190,jleiz03,t3_13qcug9,"AI will kill Fiverr

But presumably won't kill shopify.

My only issue with Shopify is that I don't know where there target market is really.  As I see it, as someone whose worked in ecommerce for 10 years,  Shopify have 3 types of customer

1. Startup types dropshipping from their bedrooms. Shopify did very well out of this type of customer during the pandemic. My concern with this type is that 90% will fail and then cancel their shopify. The ones that are very successful may want to migrate to a different platform, as even Shopifys top tier plan isn't as cheap as some alternatives. 

2. Small mom n pop companies who want an online presence. I believe many of these will discover that selling online is extremely expensive when you try marketing. So they'll either sell very little or will give up online entirely 

3. Medium size or established small businesses. Many of these won't want to migrate to another platform to save $, but some will.  Shopifys continued success depends on these type of companies not wanting to switch

So, in summary,  my worry about shopify targeting small companies is that most of those companies will fail as they discover that the biggest impediment to selling online isn't having a nice looking store, but nstead huge marketing costs. 
Of the ones that are successful - how many will stay? The difficulty and cost in changing platform is perhaps Shopifys Moat",t3_13qcug9,1684918713.0,3

15194,jleq703,t3_13qcug9,"Nice post! I much rather SHOP because it has a bright future ahead of it. People are getting tired of amazon. I don't think it's in the same category as fiverr though. That said, even with the AI advances, new gig jobs will be created for data labelling, and verifications. It'll be a while though because those bots love to hallucinate when trying to give you an answer (which many have yet to realize).

15199,jlgd8fd,t3_13qcug9,"I have little faith in shop. I think they will always be relegated to small shops selling discretionary goods. When a business gets to a certain size, they move on. 

I am a little more favorable (but not by much) of fiverr simply because services change over time but will never go away. But I question what their ceiling is. I do understand that segments will be impacted over time. Graphic design is already being hit. But this is another one of those things where its customer base is likely small businesses. Nothing wrong with that, but stability and long term outlook will probably be limited. 

I personally wont buy either.",t3_13qcug9,1684950413.0,1

15209,jletr27,t1_jlephtu,"It's the best option for many many companies. If we were starting our business today, we'd use shopify, but as it's too expensive to move away (from our current platform Magento), we're just gonna stay. One great attraction to Shopify isn't so much what it can do (as most of the other big platforms do much of the same things), but that it's so easy to get started on.  Coupled with the fact that it's difficult and expensive to move off any CMS, gives Shopify protection.

I would add free trade agreements to deflationary drivers. The pendulum has swung back the other way, however.  So I would add protectionism, sanctions, and export restrictions to inflationary drivers going forward. Lots of stuff made in Mexico used to be made in the U.S. (NAFTA), for example.

Also a deflationary driver was the drop in the cost of transportation.  Container ships, the rise of cheap air express services, etc.  It facilitated just in time inventory, fresh berries in January, fresh salmon from Alaska, fast fashion from China, etc.  That trend was reversed a year or two ago, but the freight costs and other shipping costs have returned to normal. But you can't have electric cargo ships, so as fuel prices go up, that'll be a slight inflationary driver going forward.",t3_12cmumr,1680728436.0,3

Question: why would females entering the work force be deflationary? Wouldn't more people working lead to more income and more demand for gods and services? I would think it would be inflationary.

15313,jf498zi,t3_12cmumr,"The largest deflationary force out there is our collective debt. It squeezes everything. It constrains everything.  Many governments still have credit to spare but private industry has borrowed a ton and has little room to expand, relatively speaking. Consumers have even less credit. 

The world needs austerity. People do not like that so governments will be forced to spend more. But, they will not be allowed to do so in sufficient amounts to grow the economy. 

There will be a backlash, because people do not like getting poorer. Governments will respond as they always have. Inflation will take off and wipe out all the debt. We will start the cycle over. 

I question your assertion that we have been in a "" deflationary regime from the last 4 decades"". If you are focusing on the U.S. then we have had deflation in imported items, but overall inflation has been pretty consistent at 3% or so. Necessities have inflated much faster than that.",t3_12cmumr,1680736749.0,1

The deflationary nature of tech should not be ignored simply because it has to do with clean energy or EV's.  

The real story here is about battery innovation and production.  Suffice to say it's a need that's not going away.  This has been clear for some time.  Industry understands this and massive  investments in  production capacity are under construction right now.  

As that capacity comes online, the cost to produce battery electric vehicles becomes significantly less that traditional vehicles.  The cost to fuel EV's is already significantly less.  The maintenance costs are already significantly less.  

Add to this mix the Russian invasion and Europe will now be paying the early adopter price tag to become energy independent.  The ESG investments of yesteryear have developed tech to the point where this is possible, practical, and ultimately a huge net benefit to not have the associated cost of being a net energy importer.",t3_12cmumr,1680757747.0,1

Coming to your point about more goods and services being produced - more being produced doesn't equate to inflation. The increase in prices leads to inflation.

But I don't agree with it, because you aren't considering the whole ecosystem.

Scaling battery productions and EV production doesn't happen in isolation from the rest of the world. The raw materials for producing them do not fall from heaven, they are dug out from the earth.

You can make it as efficient as possible, but it still doesn't become a tech company. A tech company can make one product or service only once and sell it many times. If every time you need to make another unit of your product or service, you need to buy raw material, then you aren't a tech company. Your costs go up if the cost of the raw material goes up.

And honestly, if battery and EV production is actually so low cost then governments wouldn't be offering tax breaks/carbon credits to consumers to buy or to companies to produce. Governments when they are doing this, means they are taking on debt in some form or other, you can call it whatever you want.

Then coming to the electricity to charge the EV vehicles. If you truly want it to be green, and be at scale, then definitely current sources of electricity generation cannot be used. So are governments or private investors going to invest in new infrastructure to generate green electricity? And if you use existing sources of electricity, but EV vehicles go at scale, do we have enough infrastructure? And if we don't have enough infrastructure but have a lot of EV vehicles, which would increase demand, don't you think the price of charging your EV goes up?

There's more than meets the eye and it's important to think from where the raw material for batteries would come and from where the electricity to charge the EV's will come once everything is at scale.

Yes.  That is happening now.  They are digging them out.  The battery factories that are being built have already signed contracts for raw materials.

>You can make it as efficient as possible, but it still doesn't become a tech company. A tech company can make one product or service only once and sell it many times. If every time you need to make another unit of your product or service, you need to buy raw material, then you aren't a tech company. Your costs go up if the cost of the raw material goes up.

Ok, so is Apple a tech company?  Or Intel?  They have to buy raw material to produce their products.  The market values Tesla like a high growth tech company, not like Ford and GM.  Markets are forward looking and are usually right about things like this. 

>And honestly, if battery and EV production is actually so low cost then governments wouldn't be offering tax breaks/carbon credits to consumers to buy or to companies to produce. Governments when they are doing this, means they are taking on debt in some form or other, you can call it whatever you want.

I didn't say it was low cost.  I said it would become much lower cost over a relatively short time frame, and if you look at the cost per KWH to produce batteries over the last 10 years, you can see what I mean.  Governments have various reasons for subsidizing EV's, but many EV's are now able to compete on their own without subsidies like Hyundai.  As they get cheaper and cheaper to produce this will accelerate adoption.

And if we don't have enough infrastructure but have a lot of EV vehicles, which would increase demand, don't you think the price of charging your EV goes up?

I don't ""want it to be green"".  I'm trying to look at trends to see what is likely to occur.  Ultimately natural gas will be with us for quite some time.   All we really need for the EV push to be ""green"" is just to continue replacing coal plants with natural gas ones as economics has been doing for some time already.  Long term though we're probably looking at a future of mostly offshore wind / solar/ batteries / nuclear.  

In some areas infrastructure will need upgrading as the market shifts, but we're not talking major changes.  EV charging takes a little more juice than running a big AC system, but it overwhelmingly happens at night when other usage is much lower.  

There's actually quite a huge potential in smart grids communicating with EV's on the local level to shift around charging for the benefit of the grid.",t3_12cmumr,1680766242.0,1

The same would be true of Apple, which needs to procure parts to make iphones and ipads as well as many other companies we think of as tech companies.

Scalability is important, however.  When Tesla designs a car, they make more money when they sell ten million of those than when they sell 1 million because the design costs can be spread out among ten million vehicles. The same is true for Intel processors, Apple iPhones, Cisco routers, and yes Microsoft Office.

Apart from MSFT, all of the others you mentioned will have lower valuations in an inflationary environment, even if they make more money, because scalability will become the issue. For 20 million EV's to sell every year, which is about 30% of global automobile sales, we will have some real problems because the infrastructure isn't available, as yet. The infrastructure spreads across digging out lithium all the way to the electricity generation for charging the EV vehicles. For the infrastructure to scale, more investment a.k.a debt will need to be taken on.

Anyway, time will tell, I could be wrong but it's a game of probabilities, so I could be right too. I am focusing on the process. And the more I discuss with people, the more I realize my process is tight, so far.",t3_12cmumr,1680798161.0,1

Google have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording ""their precious"".

I am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...

Though its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.

NVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. 

Same with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. 

my view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.

1) Improved language processing: With advancements in language processing, future iterations of Microsoft Office's natural language processing capabilities could offer enhanced understanding and processing of human language. This could lead to improved features in applications like Microsoft Word, where the software could better understand complex sentence structures, nuances of language, and contextual cues. It might provide more accurate grammar and style suggestions, assist with language translation, or offer intelligent content organization based on the context of the document.

2) Enhanced creativity: Microsoft Office applications like PowerPoint, Word, or even Excel could incorporate AI models with enhanced creativity. For example, PowerPoint might offer AI-generated design suggestions, helping users create visually appealing and creative presentations. Microsoft Word could provide assistance with generating original content, such as creative writing prompts or suggestions for engaging introductions. Excel might incorporate AI-powered data visualization suggestions, helping users present data in more visually impactful ways.

3) Better problem-solving: Microsoft Excel, with improved computing power and AI capabilities, could become more adept at solving complex problems. It might offer advanced mathematical functions and solvers that assist with complex calculations or optimization problems. Excel could also integrate AI-powered plug-ins for scientific analysis, hypothesis testing, or data-driven decision-making (like Stock Trades, yay!). Additionally, AI-assisted chatbots within Microsoft Teams could provide support in problem-solving scenarios by offering intelligent recommendations or guiding users through troubleshooting steps.

4) Increased personalization: Microsoft Office applications could leverage user-specific data and AI algorithms to personalize the user experience. For instance, Microsoft Outlook might provide personalized email suggestions based on an individual's writing style and past interactions. Microsoft Word could offer customized document templates or formatting options based on a user's preferences and historical document usage patterns. PowerPoint might suggest slide layouts and designs tailored to the user's presentation style and previous presentations.

5) Improved multi-lingual capabilities: Microsoft Office applications could incorporate advanced language translation features. For instance, Microsoft Word might integrate improved translation tools to facilitate seamless communication across different languages within documents. PowerPoint could offer real-time language translation during presentations, enabling presenters to engage with audiences who speak different languages. Additionally, Microsoft Teams could leverage enhanced multi-lingual capabilities, allowing for more effective collaboration and communication among team members from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

**All-in, I see a big potential - and the stock is very much a buy or hold for many as a result.**

Microsoft are extremely adept at altering their software for changes in markets, and this is where the 'home-working' functionality is looking extremely positive, as a small example of them giving businesses the tools they need to push push push for more functions.

&#x200B;

As more people work from home - the impact on companies is now clear: people working from home are being paid less, yet, earn more as they no longer have to travel. This will lead to an increase in disposable income, impacting consumer demand.

If personal taxation was lowered, this would/could be a thing which drags economies out of the debt they are in. I am expanding your point I will admit, but this is part of a bigger topic than just 'hey MSFT is releasing AI'.

This leads to pressure to lower personal income tax at government levels globally.

More people working form home under contract.

No more need to 'learn how to create an manage a database'

No more need to 'take a night class to learn how to do X in Y Microsoft product to get Z job/position'.

I'm not trying to say consumer is close to industrial, far from, i use both professionally, and there's not a comparison yet.. but for the price.. consumer is getting pretty decently close, close enough and agile enough to run a small business with great success. 

DM has tapped into the metal at home printing as well, which SSYS is buying with their purchase and folding into their portfolio. What I really want to see is china start entering that market to push both innovation and costs for the consumer/business and open up the market for small guys who can't quite afford 100k+ yet

This entire idea that Google was going to lose search because of ChatGPT was also completely ridiculous.  Look which search engine had the MOST growth in the last month.

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

BTW, I think it is now pretty obvious that Fortune 500 companies are going to adopt LLMs.  They take massive resources to train and to run in production.   Google was so smart to develop the TPUs 8 years ago.  Now with the fourth generation in production and soon to release the fifth.   The TPUs allows Google to have higher margins in the training and running the LLM models.   They are not dependent on Nvidia like all their competitors.

The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.

Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.

Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.

If you read the definitions you will find this:  


**Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.

Read the definitions at the bottom‚Ä¶ try to wrap your head around comparing HV to IV. That is really the core principle.

From there you can interpret if options are cheap or are expensive.

Each table is just the ‚Äútop‚Äù options that meet that criteria.

Sell expensive, buy cheap. Higher efficiency better than low. Watch out for earnings, or make a play on them but don‚Äôt be surprised.

>  
>Bullish Scenario: If the market continues to show resilience as it has in recent days, we could see a continuation of the upward trend. This could be further supported if there's positive news from the meeting between McCarthy and Biden regarding the debt ceiling agreement. In this case, SPY could potentially move towards the flipping point at a strike of 417.1, as indicated by the GEX analysis.  
>  
>Bearish Scenario: If the market reacts negatively to the declining MACD on the weekly chart and the slowing GDP growth, we could see a downward movement in SPY. This could be exacerbated if there's no agreement on the debt ceiling, leading to a potential market sell-off.  
>  
>Neutral Scenario: Given the mixed market sentiment indicated by the MSI and VIX signals, the market could also remain relatively stable, with SPY oscillating around its current levels.

Or a retailer could use Midjourney's image generator to quickly create product photos for their website without having to hire professional photographers.

2. The industries that will be most disrupted by LLM-driven AI are those where humans currently perform tasks that could easily be automated by chatbots or other computer programs.

If you go to verify all the claims that OpenAI, Meta and Google do about the logic/math capabilities of their LLM, you'll see the kind of problems the models have been tested on. Just cherry picking of problems on which a language model can do decently.

Again, language model are only good to predict a ""next token"", producing plausible text. They don't do math and don't do logic, which is instead necessary for replacing a somehow skilled worker doing the jobs you mentioned.

My amygdala drives some basic and also some very undesirable behaviors. I could go on. But the point is that these systems are intelligent.

15637,jh6afz2,t3_12ua2t5,"Insurance is paper intensive, or it was 35 years ago. Back then, I worked for a company that outsourced work from insurance companies. My expertise was in back offices and computer automation. Actually, no one was an expert back then because we were just figuring out what it meant. Technology challenges were definitely a factor in those days.

I have been retired for a decade by then, most of the low fruit has been harvested.  Forms are standardized, and data are scraped from them and jammed into legacy back end systems,  eliminating the data entry that occurred before. Obviously the internet changed that problem too. 

By the time I retired,  Gartner had coined the term ""Business Process Management."" Insurance companies were quick to adopt.  At its heart, there were rules engines, either procedural or AI, during the process flow of work. 

How much will the current versions of AI change things vs. what was already available to the enterprise is yet to be seen. Visions of underwriters disappearing may be overreaching? Or not.  

If the past is an indication of the future, it will be a niche solution for a long time, and it will be slow to create shareowner value. Integrators or outsourcers may get a piece of the technology dollars, too.",t3_12ua2t5,1682100929.0,2
15638,jh76opb,t3_12ua2t5,"So obviously I asked chatGPT your question since it has first hand experience :)
 This is the answer:

There are several industries that stand to benefit significantly from cost savings due to AI advancements. Here are some of the most promising:

1. Healthcare: AI can help reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and predicting patient outcomes.

2. Manufacturing: AI can optimize manufacturing processes by predicting maintenance needs, reducing downtime, and increasing production efficiency.

3. Retail: AI can help retailers optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and personalize customer experiences, leading to increased sales and cost savings.

4. Banking and finance: AI can help banks and financial institutions automate routine tasks, detect fraudulent activity, and optimize investment strategies.

5. Transportation: AI can optimize transportation networks, reduce fuel consumption, and improve logistics, leading to significant cost savings for both shippers and carriers.

Overall, the potential cost savings from AI are significant and span across many industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more industries benefiting from its advancements.",t3_12ua2t5,1682114214.0,2

15640,jh6kmal,t3_12ua2t5,"Insurance is one of the least likely to be replaced by AI. Claims processing and underwriting could perhaps be largely automated, but not actuarial sciences.

2. Anthem = 58k
3. Liberty Mutual = 50k
4. MetLife = 49k
5. Cigna = 46k
6. Progressive = 36k
7. Nationwide = 34k
8. USAA = 33k

I think that it'd have to improve by HUGE leaps and bounds before a 100 percent automated AI call center would work.

However, I've deal with many automated customer help lines and there's so many times where I have to repeat a phrase over and over again and it will either think I'm saying something completely different than what I'm saying or that it ""didn't quite get that, can you repeat it?""

From a stock picking standpoint, I think we want to concentrate on the very first industries that will be completely transformed by this. I think until speech recognition has been completely solved, this will delay your hypothesis.

Airlines were no doubt the future since 1930, but they have produced a net negative return for shareholders. After the railway mania in the 1860s, it took 115 years until the net return turned positive for them. 

That doesn't mean that you can't profit from clear trends, but you either have to be very early - or buy companies that will benefit from the trend, but are not the clear picks and shovels. 

For example you need computing power, so semis seem like a good bet - but they are overvalued. Now you look what goes into Semis, and see that most companies that supply semi stocks are also expensive. So you look what they need. Do that until you find a company or sector that is very cheap and very much exposed to the trend - but where most of the people dont pay attention.",t3_12464pz,1679992227.0,9

A group of about 140 professionals (primarily biologists, but also including lawyers and physicians) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of recombinant DNA technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the precautionary principle.

In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.

I'm actually betting that AI will become a big part of AR/VR. That's what most people aren't realizing.

There's a lot of immersive technology that AI can provide in the metaverse, as I mentioned.

AI agents will be able to replicate the movement and mind of any human being or persona, and once you create a digital realm, i.e. metaverse in which they can reside, you will be able to visit them in person and interact with them in the metaverse like you couldn't in real life except go to a concert or ask for an autograph from a celebrity.

If you could have infinite dynamic experiences of a movie world with the characters of that movie, wouldn't you spend endless amounts of time in your favorite ""reality""? If you are a LOTR fan for example, you could live in that world recreated/generated by AI. The possibilities are endless, once the infrastructure and technology, i.e. AI and VR/AR are ready.

What we are seeing with the interest in AI chatbots now are that most people just want to have some kind of connection, even if it's not a real human connection. If it can mimic a human well enough, that is good enough for them.

There are several reasons why:

1) You've included companies with an earnings announcement more than 120 days away. While this might be fine for some investors, it's certainly not ideal for those looking to invest in the near-term.

2) Many of the stocks on this list are small-cap or micro-cap stocks, which tend to be much more volatile and risky than their large-cap counterparts. For example, Company XYZ on your list has a market cap of just $50 million while Company ABC has a market cap of over $10 billion.

This could be a battle of Ubiquities 
Windows has had a long history of ""Bugs"" so there is a big IF here; but IF they successfully integrate it and the software package (windows as a whole) operates well--it SHOULD erode Googles market share and quickly (given Microsoft's current and future presence in offices, schools and homes etc) but NO Microsoft is not operating in a vacuum with a static market--Google has been working and will be pressed hard to release their own AI.
--So, I think first to release a viable AI (well integrated with functional software/hardware) will get a significant boost; not likely to ""Kill"" the competition but a bet now will prove profitable--which horse to pick?

16200,j8v3lv0,t3_1146ap4,"Microsoft has always been like this.   They have always taken a very short term view.  

So they jumped on this ChatGPT for Bing but did not really think through the consequences.

Ultimately search is all about trust.   Nobody is going to use a search engine they can not trust.

Microsoft already had bad branding with Bing.  Now having it return made up answers is only going to further hurt the brand down the road.  Not immediately as there is still a lot of hype with ChatGPT.

But the positive is the fact Bing has almost no market share.  So there is very little to loose.  Google has over 30X more market share

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

BTW, I am a shareholder of MSFT and have been for a very long time.

But what bugs me the most about Microsoft is that they are not inventing or innovating anything.

Browsers they had IE and failed.  They had Edge and failed.  So they just give up and now using Google.   This strategy will never enable you to win!

Phones it is the same story.  They had a phone but gave up and now using Google for their phone.   But not only Android but also Google Play Services!!!   Is that insane?

When Google invested into the TPUs 8 years ago, Microsoft did an FPGA instead of an ASIC.  Again what a short term view.  Now Google has their fourth generation TPUs and working on the fifth and have a HUGE advantage over Microsoft.

""Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised""

https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-records

Google got it 8 years ago and Microsoft just did not.  Since Microsoft can't do it themselves like Google they need to buy something.  But what can they buy?

Here is a great article that is dated but so much more true today.

https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/

It is the same story with AI.   Google invents transformers.   Microsoft invests into a company that is using Google fundamental breakthrough.   So Microsoft is two folds away from the actual innovation.

But Alphabet/Google is also producing the most impressive technology thing I have seen and even trumps the rockets landing on the ground.

16208,j8ukjzb,t3_1146ap4,"Ok unless you haven‚Äôt figured it out but there‚Äôs a ‚Äútech-recession‚Äù going on. That has been massive lay offs all over Silicon Valley. This affects the whole industry, including Microsoft. The era of ludicrous spending on marketing and innovations has come to a standstill for now or prolly an end. The department that will suffer the most is R&D, hence, most of these companies are gonna be run like they are on survival mode. They need a sustainable business model to keep afloat, while their cash flows remain positive and a steady increase in revenue to keep their consistent earning growth. 

With AI, it‚Äôs not about monetization at this point, it‚Äôs about getting in first and taking market share. So picture Facebook in 04, the social media market was in its infancy and Facebook was able to corner the market before it started making a profit through business ads and data sales. The same applies to AI. If Microsoft can get in first with Bing, the amount of user data it can accrue could help build its other business. It has infinite potential.

I think there is a broader issue with the tech industry where the term AI has been used excessively and inappropriately so that people have unrealistic expectations and don't realize exactly how far off we are from strong AI. I think it would be much more appropriate to call technologies like ChatGPT with a much less ambitions term, like ""algorithm"".

In addition, I think people are not that interested in technology that mimics natural interaction with people - when they search for something they want results that are as accurate and relevant as possible (ideally while also safeguarding their privacy), not a wall of text that tries to mimic what an actual person might write. If ChatGPT can provide that, it might make Microsoft's search engine perform better for most people and this might impct Microsoft's bottom line. If all they can show is some fancy chat like feature's I think people will quickly lose interest - just like with pseudo-AI assistants like Siri.

I think that the future of what we now call AI is under the hood to provide more relevant and curated information to users, without even being noticed, not the current ""in your face"" approach where the novelty wears off quickly.",t3_1146ap4,1676626842.0,1

I don't know what you mean here.

Ther's a motivation why if you access Google from Edge It asks you to set It as the favorite search page, Bing does the same: the added revenue generated from searches Is important for the respective companies.

- We do not have any idea how they work
- We don't know what even older models are cable of (there full range of capabilities)
- We don't know what abilities models will gain as we scale them

Sure, thats a given.

Whereas Chat GPT I might ask it a complex (and costly to compute) maths problem. 

Obviously I have no insight into what the servers are costing Open AI, but that model right now is not making money, and if it does will be a pure (pay only) subscription service. IMO a subscription service for complex problems is not a competitor to google search. Maybe it is for 5% of the search functions, and again, only if you pay for it.

Even  if I'm wrong, how hard would it be to stick ads under the responses? Like right now I can ask Google ""how many feet are in a meter?"" and it gives me an answer. There are no ads in the search results, and typically I would never look at the search results because Google just tells me the answer right at the top. If ChatGPT replaces Google, the only place in which Google's making ad money from search is when you are looking for a specific website, and they suggest some. ""Best dating apps,"" ""Therapists in CA,"" ""Fantasy Football Website,"" that's where Google is making money by bumping up sponsored results.
