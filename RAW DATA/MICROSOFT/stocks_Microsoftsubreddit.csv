0,Google falls 3% pre-market as Microsoft gains 2% on reports that Samsung is considering Bing as default search engine across all devices,2984,12pcfpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12pcfpt/google_falls_3_premarket_as_microsoft_gains_2_on/,525,1681730699.0,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html)

 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Bing may replace Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search service on Samsung Electronics Co. devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. 

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground. Those include adding artificial intelligence features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported."
1,Microsoft reportedly plans to invest $10 billion in creator of buzzy A.I. tool ChatGPT,2475,108b31n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/108b31n/microsoft_reportedly_plans_to_invest_10_billion/,423,1673360727.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html

Microsoft plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup behind popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, according to a report from Semafor.

The deal is part of a funding round with other investors involved that would value OpenAI at a whopping $29 billion, Semafor reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It isn't clear whether the deal has been finalized but term sheets sent to prospective investors indicated the plan was to close the deal by the end of 2022, Semafor reported.

Microsoft will reportedly get a 75% share of OpenAI's profits until it makes back the money on its investment, after which the company would assume a 49% stake in OpenAI.

Microsoft and OpenAI were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

For several weeks, the tech world has been abuzz with chatter about ChatGPT. The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.

The AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.

A bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google. The company's Bing browser has only a small share of the global search engine market, however it is hoped the deal could help the firm chip away at Google's dominance by offering more advanced search capabilities.

In December, Morgan Stanley published a report examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share ""and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.""

OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November. Despite optimism over its potential, the project is burning through cash due to the overwhelming level of pressure on its servers arising from its virality. Five days after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Altman said that the chat research tool crossed 1 million users."
2,I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022,2422,x1fjlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x1fjlg/i_tried_4_paid_services_for_stock_selection_here/,204,1661855480.0,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits.

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%

7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

3,Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,2357,13rxgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rxgz6/cathie_woods_ark_invest_sold_most_of_its_nvidia/,405,1685058945.0,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

4,"Tech leaders are calling for an A.I. pause because they have no product ready, Palantir CEO says",2188,1453tou,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1453tou/tech_leaders_are_calling_for_an_ai_pause_because/,328,1686313481.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html

Palantir’s boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if “such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that “many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.”

He added, without naming anyone, that this is because “people who have nothing to offer want to study AI,” but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, “studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield” is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an “A.I. race” akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that “there is already an A.I. arms race, it’s just we’re ahead, [and] it’s not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.”

He pointed out that the “single most important event” in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir’s AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces.

5,CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,1751,12fnz2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12fnz2b/cnbc_chatgpt_is_already_generating_savings_for/,290,1680964593.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google’s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft’s Bing chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder’s network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

“If you’re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,” she said. “This is second nature to you.”

Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

“We saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,” Haller said. “I don’t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I’ve been in this world for a long time.”

ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

“If they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,” she said. “Or better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.”

She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm’s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

“We saw it first on the demand side,” Ghanta said. “Now we’re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.”

ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

“For example, ChatGPT is bad at math,” he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. “If you say, ″Let’s do this step by step’ in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,” he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

“The currency of the day in hiring hasn’t changed, it’s a resume,” Ghanta said. “Hiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.”

They’re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

“I encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,” he said. “From a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.”

There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs “exposed” to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

“When Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn’t trust pictures anymore,’” Haller said. “Since the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.”"
6,Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,1677,10vikbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/,476,1675718450.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”"

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest."

9,Microsoft Bets Big on the Creator of ChatGPT in Race to Dominate A.I.,1095,10at56y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10at56y/microsoft_bets_big_on_the_creator_of_chatgpt_in/,252,1673612228.0,"This comes with rights to use their technology on MSFT products 

When a chatbot called ChatGPT hit the internet late last year, executives at a number of Silicon Valley companies worried they were suddenly dealing with new artificial intelligence technology that could disrupt their businesses.

But at Microsoft, it was a cause for celebration. For several years, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, had been putting the pieces in place for this moment.

In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco company that designed ChatGPT. And in the years since, it has quietly invested another $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the investment who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.

The $3 billion paid for the huge amounts of computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. And it meant that Microsoft could rapidly build and deploy new products based on the technology.

____


It has already been a home run partly because Satya was prescient enough to make the bet three years ago, and because all applications will be generative in the future,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing partner at Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group.

MSFT technology:

A year later, Microsoft invested $1 billion in the company and committed to building the supercomputer technologies OpenAI’s enormous models would demand while becoming its “preferred partner for commercializing” its technologies. OpenAI later officially licensed its technologies to Microsoft, allowing the company to directly add them to Microsoft products and services.

10,Investors beware: Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments this week could spark a major tech sell-off,930,11l1jod,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11l1jod/investors_beware_fed_chair_jerome_powells/,322,1678201149.0,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/investors-beware-fed-chair-jerome-powell-s-comments-this-week-could-spark-a-major-tech-sell-off-top-analyst-warns/ar-AA18i8Ag?ocid=hpmsn&cvid=b3053bf321d9497a8761bbdbbcab332f&ei=62)

After dropping more than 33% last year amid aggressive interest rate hikes and stubborn inflation, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has recovered roughly 12% in 2023. Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors’ bubble this week. 

Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He’s expected to discuss February’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated “ongoing” rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.”

Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not “overly hawkish”—repeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance—every time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.

As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell “retreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone” during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed’s benchmark interest rate."

Earnings: $2.45 per share, vs. $2.23 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $52.86 billion, vs. $51.02 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue is projected to be up 3% from a year earlier, which would mark a second straight quarter of growth below 10%. Before that, percentage expansion had been in double digits in every quarter since 2017.

Results are expected to be weakest in Microsoft’s personal computing division, which includes Windows operating system licenses sold to PC makers, along with Xbox consoles and Surface devices. Research firm Gartner estimated that PC shipments declined 30% in the quarter.

Microsoft’s Azure cloud business remains a bright spot for the company, but growth is slowing. Analysts surveyed by CNBC expect 26.5% growth from a year earlier, while analysts polled by StreetAccount predict 27.2% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose the size of its Azure business in dollars.

In the fiscal second quarter, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew by 31%, down from 35% in the prior period.

Investors have another reason to be excited about Azure, which has aligned itself with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

During the quarter, Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and said it would draw on the company’s artificial intelligence models for a new version of its Bing search engine and enhancements to the Microsoft 365 productivity software.


Microsoft shares have risen 17% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up less than 8% over the same period.

Executives will discuss the results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

13,Google is panicking! Google Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I. Fight,675,10i2ey2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10i2ey2/google_is_panicking_google_calls_in_help_from/,347,1674337122.0,"A rival chatbot has shaken Google out of its routine, with the founders who left three years ago re-engaging and more than 20 A.I. projects in the works.

Last month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival’s new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google’s $149 billion search business.

Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google’s artificial intelligence product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google’s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put A.I. front and center in their plans.

The re-engagement of Google’s founders, at the invitation of the company’s current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT.

The bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.

The new A.I. technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Mr. Pichai declared a “code red,” upending existing plans and jump-starting A.I. development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.

At the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its work force. On Friday, the company said it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed “to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,” Mr. Pichai wrote in a note to employees.

This is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,” said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a start-up called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. “ChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, ‘Here’s what a compelling new search experience could look like.’” Mr. Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of A.I. to stay competitive.

Since stepping back from day-to-day duties, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Mr. Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying car start-ups and disaster relief efforts.

Their visits to the company’s Silicon Valley offices in the last few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls “Other Bets,” one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.

But they have long been keen on bringing A.I. into Google’s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Mr. Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Mr. Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, “Why can’t it automatically write that email for you?” In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading A.I. research lab based in London.

But several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.

* Microsoft shares climbed 3.2% to a record Thursday and are now up 46% this year.
* The company could pick up $10 billion or more in annual artificial intelligence revenue from developers using its Azure cloud or OpenAI’s models, an executive said this week.
* JPMorgan analysts raised their price target on Microsoft stock Wednesday.

Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker’s growth prospects in artificial intelligence.

The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.

AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.

Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.

Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”

Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.

In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”

In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.

Scott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.

“Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.

“There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.

Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.

“While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.

With Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.

Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&P 500."

Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again? 

  
TL;dr  
People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this ""overvalued"" in my life. What is keeping it up?"

Thanks for all responses and ideas. Great insight from some of you.

In the end it would exponentially dwarf retails gain in the scenario I’m thinking of. Someone pointed out that if AI could solve the stock market, the stock market would be the least of my worries by then too. Some people testing Google’s and Open AI’s projects have had some dark conversations with them, so maybe the AI will just sell everything at 0.01 and say fuck you.

Some of you greatly underestimate how AI will change our lives. Maybe we wouldn’t need money by then.

That reminded me of MSFT/Open AI.  Throwing a product out there (while ok, it does some nice things).  It would be VERY hard to believe GOOGL.  Who has run all sorts of AI tests/in healthcare with alpha fold (deepmind).  Its completely incompetent.

&#x200B;

Part of me is thinking Google is testing the waters, looking like they missed the boat, but they are letting their competition go first......and maybe fail.  That way they can see what the public likes and tweak their AI platform rather than being first to the market.  Its a bold move, but google has the most data......they are very astute.

While I have written about the Ad tech bubble and why its the worst since the great recession, GOOGLE IMO is the top dog in AI at the moment.  They are letting the other poker players flaunt their hands and then the royal flush will come out.

Also Baird 'failing' and these Sketchy 'google memo released that execs are angry over their missing AI'  its all a big show that google might be putting on to SLAP down competition later. 

I wouldn't bet against this.  Thoughts?"

BuzzFeed [said](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/our-way-forward?d_id=5419973&ref=bftwbuzzfeed&utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=bftwbuzzfeed) Thursday that it will work with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to use artificial intelligence to help create content for its audience, marking a milestone in how media companies implement the new technology into their businesses.

Jonah Peretti, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, told employees in a memo that they can expect “AI inspired content” to “move from an R&D stage to part of our core business.”

Peretti elaborated that the technology will be used to create quizzes, help with brainstorming, and assist in personalizing content to its audience. BuzzFeed, for now, will not use artificial intelligence to help write news stories, a spokesperson told CNN.

“To be clear, we see the breakthroughs in AI opening up a new era of creativity that will allow humans to harness creativity in new ways with endless opportunities and applications for good,” Peretti said. “In publishing, AI can benefit both content creators and audiences, inspiring new ideas and inviting audience members to co-create personalized content.”

“When you see this work in action it is pretty amazing,” Peretti added, vowing to “lead the future of AI-powered content.”

The news sent BuzzFeed’s sagging stock skyrocketing more than 150% in trading Thursday to more than $2 a share.

Media industry leaders have increasingly said that artificial intelligence will revolutionize their businesses.

While BuzzFeed is the biggest digital content creator to move to implement OpenAI’s technology into its business, some other outlets have taken similar steps.

CNET recently used an artificial intelligence tool to help write stories. But the process did not go smoothly, with a number of articles ultimately requiring corrections.

In a note published online Wednesday, CNET Editor-In-Chief Connie Guglielmo [apologized for the errors ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/tech/cnet-ai-tool-news-stories/index.html)and said new processes had been put in place to prevent them in the future.

But, Guglielmo said, the outlet will not shy away from using artificial intelligence moving forward.

“The process may not always be easy or pretty, but we’re going to continue embracing it – and any new tech that we believe makes life better,” Guglielmo wrote."
21,Tesla stock collapse - All you need to know - Part 1,228,zv1dxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zv1dxh/tesla_stock_collapse_all_you_need_to_know_part_1/,385,1671986177.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.

22,Microsoft Boosts Investment in ChatGPT Parent OpenAI,207,10jghuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10jghuc/microsoft_boosts_investment_in_chatgpt_parent/,33,1674491170.0,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327?mod=hp_LATEST)

Microsoft has agreed to expand its investment in OpenAI, the software company behind the popular artificial intelligence apps [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). 

Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and OpenAI [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) [the expanded investment](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/) on Monday. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Bloomberg reported that a person familiar with the discussions said the agreement covers $10 billion over multiple years. Microsoft [invested $1 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-artificial-intelligence-startup-11563813648?mod=article_inline) in OpenAI in 2019 and made an additional investment of an undisclosed amount in 2021.

Neither Microsoft nor OpenAI could immediately be reached for comment.

Microsoft said the new agreement “extends our ongoing collaboration across AI supercomputing and research and enables each of us to independently commercialize the resulting advanced AI technologies.” The company added that it will use OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products, and introduce software built on OpenAI technology.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”

OpenAI said in a blog post that the “multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment” will allow the company “to continue our independent research and develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.”

Adding the natural-language capabilities of ChatGPT to Microsoft’s Bing search engine could make it a more formidable competitors to market leader Google, although parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also has made substantial bets on artificial intelligence software, acquiring the AI start-up DeepMind in 2014.

In a research note, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that while Bing holds a smart share of the search engine market, “Microsoft still seeks to gain share vs. Google’s dominant search engine by offering more advanced search capabilities and language models that could take market share away from Google over time.”

Ives also sees applications for the software in Outlook, Office, and videogame software."

Earnings per share (EPS): $1.05 vs $1.18 per share expected, according to Refinitiv 

Revenue: $76.05 billion, vs. $76.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:

YouTube advertising revenue: $8.25 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google Cloud revenue: $7.43 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.32 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google’s core ad business is expected to report minimal expansion from a year earlier, and growth is likely to remain in the single digits until late 2023, based on analyst estimates.

A slowing economy and competition from TikTok have hurt Google as well as digital ad rivals Snap and Facebook. Earlier this week, Snap reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Facebook parent Meta topped estimates but still recorded a 4% decline in sales.

In January, Alphabet announced it was laying off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce. The company told employees recently that more of them will be at risk for low performance ratings than in prior years.

Alphabet also cut staff in its health sciences unit Verily by 15%, citing a restructuring that will supposedly better position the business to seek financial independence.

Pressure is mounting for Google in other ways.

Artificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is viewed as posing a risk to Google’s search engine. Executives teased that the company may introduce a similar product to the public at some point this year. CNBC reported this week that Google is internally experimenting with several potential products that could influence its search business.

In January, the U.S. Justice Department filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, this one targeting its advertising business. It marked the first federal lawsuit against Google filed during the Biden administration.

Google is now showing its willingness to invest heavily in live sports. During the fourth quarter, the company agreed to pay $2 billion per year for the next seven years for YouTube to own the exclusive rights for “NFL Sunday Ticket.”

24,On Tesla's valuation (Part Trois),162,y8sdc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/,184,1666254030.0,"Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

> We have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.

Following Q3, this was slightly disappointing at 17.2%. Lower than Q1 despite higher deliveries, in part due to lower deliveries compared to production as Tesla is shifting away from end-of-quarter delivery pushes (20K cars were on a boat at the end of the quarter that previously would've been sold before quarter end). That said, it's still up 18% or 2600 basis points YoY, easily industry leading for high volume automakers (BMW is second at 14.5%), and Tesla guided for record high margins in Q4.

I also said:

> While we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.

Since then, we have heard rumours that Berlin is expected to reach at least comparable margins to Shanghai, despite significantly higher wages. While this still remains uncertain, it would certainly reinforce their bullish sentiment on margins quoted above.

Then I said:

> I think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.

> That said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.

Since then, it appears that Texas and Berlin are not ramping faster than Shanghai did. 400K this year is looking entirely impossible, with ~100K being more likely.

That said, Shanghai has continued to ramp beyond expectation and is now at a 1.2M unit run rate. Peak production so far has been 57K Model Ys in August and 30K Model 3s in September, which would put the factory's maximum real output (remember factories can never reach their full run rate due to holidays and other downtime) at over 1M vehicles per year (highest volume car factory in the world by about 20%) or 250K per quarter. Well above even Q1's 170K.

------------------------------

**The numbers**

Updating the expected numbers from my previous posts (you can go back to them to compare what has changed if you like) based on the latest information, my Bear and Bull case numbers are as follows:

**Sales**

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,350,000|1,500,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,600,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,700,000|

**ASP**

Last time, ASPs increased significantly, from $50,000 to ~$57,500. In Q3 2022, they decreased slightly to $54,350. I expect these prices to start to increase again with the upcoming tax incentives, as Tesla mentioned they expect to take the full tax incentive from the Inflation Induction Act for vehicles, battery production and battery sourcing for a total of $10K+ per car. I expect this will offset the reduced demand from the recession and further increase ASPs to ~$57,5K in 2023 and then remain stable while Tesla continues to drive down costs.


**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs ($54K for 2022, $57,5K for 2023 and 2024) and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$73B|$81B|
|**2023**|$115B|$150B|
|**2024**|$150B|$213B|

**Operating Margin**

A year ago I said:

> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

This is where I was most wrong after Q1. Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. Since then, operating margin has decreased to 17.2%, with an expected record operating margin in Q4. This makes me slightly less confident about their steep increase in margins, so I will be adjusting those slightly to the downside.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|17%|19%|
|**2023**|19%|23%|
|**2024**|21%|27%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$12.4B|$15.4B|
|**2023**|$21.9B|$34.5B|
|**2024**|$31.5B|$57.5B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $700B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|56|45|
|**2023**|32|20|
|**2024**|22|12|

**PEG**

Since PE ratios are pretty useless by themselves, I've added a PEG rating this time. Large caps traditionally tend to float at PEG ratios between 1.5 and 3.5. That said, extreme growth companies like Tesla tend to have slightly lower PEG ratios, as investors assume the growth will come down more rapidly over time. So perhaps a PEG between 1 and 2 is more reasonable.

Also worth to note is that only 1.6% of companies in the S&P have a PEG of below 0.5, and 0.2 is the lowest PEG rating in the entire S&P. As a general rule of thumb though, anything below a PEG of 1 is typically considered undervalued.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|0.45|0.25|
|**2023**|0.42|0.16|
|**2024**|0.50|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

After Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap, I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024. With a growth rate between 44% and 67% respectively, Tesla would have a PEG rating of between 0.50 and 0.18. To get to normal PEG levels, that means Tesla stock would have to grow between 100% and 1,011% from here through Q1 2025.

Interesting to note is how Tesla only needs to double earnings to have a lower PE ratio than the S&P average, when high growth companies tend to have much higher PEs than the average; I'm expecting Tesla to almost 3x their earnings in just 3 years in the bear case.

Also worth mentioning is how, even in the bear case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($22B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the bull case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is entirely false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business (including their automotive software sales), as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid ""FSD doesn't exist"", ""energy is a scam"" and ""the Bot will never be useful"" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.

**TL;DR:** When you actually look at the data, instead of just reasoning by analogy, Tesla stock will need to grow between 100% and 1,011% through Q1 2025 to revert to the average PEG rating for fast growing large caps."
25,Buy Microsoft stock on the coming ChatGPT-enabled Bing,129,104a6h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/104a6h0/buy_microsoft_stock_on_the_coming_chatgptenabled/,198,1672952792.0,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) was a disappointment for its shareholders in 2022. But the new year will likely be the one of “recovery”, a D.A. Davidson analyst said in a note this morning.

Microsoft stock could climb to $270

On Thursday, Gil Luria recommended that investors buy Microsoft stock at the current discount as it has upside to $270, which translates to a more than 20% increase from here.

He’s bullish primarily on the tech behemoth’s $1.0 billion investment in OpenAI – an artificial intelligence research lab that operates “ChatGPT”.   

Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside. Longer-term, incorporating ChatGPT into Bing may provide MSFT with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance.

A day earlier, “The Information” said Microsoft was working with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into its flagship search engine.

OpenAI investment to benefit Azure as well

Interestingly, the D.A. Davidson analyst doesn’t expect OpenAI to benefit “Bing” only. In fact, Azure – its cloud platform stands to benefit just as much from the said investment. His note reads:

We’ve heard estimates between $250 million to $1.0 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI, much of which is being spent on Azure. We expect those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of GPT 4.0 later this year and the many product offshoots that’ll link to OpenAI via APIs.

In just over a month of its launch, ChatGPT has surpassed 1.0 million in terms of user count. Luria is also convinced that the multinational is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn (find out more).

The Nasdaq-listed firm is set to report its Q2 results later this month. Consensus is for it to earn $2.28 a share versus the year-ago $2.48. Versus its high in mid-August, Microsoft stock is down about 25% at writing."
26,$PYPL (PayPal) - Q1 2018 VS Q1 2023,118,13fmsz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13fmsz4/pypl_paypal_q1_2018_vs_q1_2023/,92,1683901802.0,"*Disclosure: I have a small position in PayPal which I opened last year at a BEP of $88, and I'm considering to invest significantly more at this current price of $64.*

Looking back 5 years ago in 2018 when PayPal released their Q1 earnings report at the time, the business was valued slightly more (\~$80B) than what it's valued at today (\~$71B) after their 2023 Q1 earnings report.

However, the numbers tell a story of a completely different business.

**Revenue**: $3.69B VS $7.04B (\~90%+)

**TPV**: $132B VS $354B (\~168%+)

**FCF**: $737M VS $1B (\~35%+)

**OM**: Flat on Non-GAAP and GAAP

**EPS**: $0.57 VS $1.17 (\~105%+ Non-GAAP) | $0.42 VS $0.7 (\~66%+ GAAP)

The business is guiding for lower top-line quarter on quarter at 7-8% now VS 16-18% 5 years ago.

Fundamentally though, how is it possible for this business to be so punished by the market? Am I missing something or should I be unloading big bucks on PayPal? Based on their EPS forecast of $4.95 this year (up 20% from the year before), it now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of **13**...

Is it that PayPal was so disgustingly overvalued in 2018 that the valuation is now normalised? Or is the market pricing in an imminent top/bottom line decline (which is contradicting to PayPal's guidance)?

I just don't see it. I see a market that is punishing a strong performing company for not being sexy or milking the term ""AI"".

27,ChatGPT's Effects on Companies,113,zfijwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zfijwz/chatgpts_effects_on_companies/,110,1670457445.0,"In case you may be unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a free chatbox AI developed by OpenAI that is quite literally capable of doing virtually anything.

You can ask it to write an essay, short story, movie script, create functioning programs in any coding language, answer any math or science question, and it does so within seconds.

How do you think the emergence of this AI will affect various companies? Which ones and how?

The main victim I can think of is Google. The simplicity and efficiency of this AI is unmatched and could seriously harm Google Search's usage and therefore profitability.

What are your thoughts?"

It seems like the 2010s heir-apparents to FAANG (like Uber and Zillow) flopped, yet you’d think that by now there’d have been a next wave of companies to overshadow the blue-chip giants. These guys sounded good as startups, poised to disrupt new spaces, but TSLA seems to be the lone exception doing well as a stock.

I know each company has its own story but is there a bigger picture that emerges? Hopefully AI will usher in the next tech boom but I’m still curious about that ”cohort” and whether there’s still any hope for them in terms of long-term growth.

29,Google parent Alphabet’s stock hit with two downgrades this week,95,14l5hf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14l5hf7/google_parent_alphabets_stock_hit_with_two/,85,1687946967.0,"In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet’s “narrative has caught up with the fundamentals.” In other words, the stock is priced to match the company’s current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.  
  
“What do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,” Shmulik wrote.

The analysts also pointed to Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company’s search advertising business. SGE is Google’s experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft’s Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.

“We recognize that \[Google’s\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,” Walmsley wrote in a research note. “But our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‘old’ Google…which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.”  
  
Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet’s margins.  
  
The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union’s European Commission to break up Google’s massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws."
30,Microsoft is beating Google at its own game,97,10n347x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10n347x/microsoft_is_beating_google_at_its_own_game/,152,1674871341.0,"Microsoft appears to be on the cusp of being something it hasn’t been in a long time: cutting-edge. It’s a label the company lost a long time ago after a series of small startups grew to become Microsoft’s biggest competitors. Google, for example, started out as a nimble, innovative upstart and eventually bested Microsoft in browsers, email, and mobile operating systems. But now Microsoft might be the nimble, innovative company that bests Google in artificial intelligence. And it’s all thanks to OpenAI.

OpenAI is the hottest AI lab out there with one of the buzziest and most exciting products: ChatGPT. And Microsoft is its very good friend. On Monday, the two companies announced that Microsoft was investing $10 billion into OpenAI (that’s on top of the $3 billion Microsoft has given OpenAI since 2019), and Microsoft is rumored to be adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Yeah, that’s right: The much-maligned, little-used Bing might finally become a real competitor to Google’s search.

Following the news of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that ChatGPT is a “potential game changer” for Microsoft, and that the company was “not going to repeat the same mistakes” of missing out on social and mobile that it made two decades ago. Microsoft “is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind,” Ives wrote.

There are parallels here, at least on the surface. Microsoft was once the dominant player in computer technology, with its Windows operating system being used by the vast majority of personal computers and its Internet Explorer browser being used by the vast majority of web surfers. And then it got in trouble with the US government, which sued Microsoft for using its dominant position to unfairly drive out competition and take over the then-nascent browser market by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. The lawsuit tied up Microsoft for years. In that environment, companies like Google emerged, putting out better products that people preferred in an exponentially growing market.

Microsoft still did just fine — it remains one of the most valuable companies in the world and is still more valuable than Google — but it doesn’t have the same consumer-facing cachet it did before. Its enterprise clients drive the vast majority of its revenue, through products like Microsoft 365 and Azure. Google, by contrast, is very visible to and much-used by the general consumer, owning everything from Chrome to Gmail to YouTube. Its main revenue source is the digital ads that consumers see as they navigate the internet, and the majority of them are using Google services while they do it.

But now Google is the company that’s having antitrust issues, facing multiple lawsuits from the federal government and almost every state and territory in the country that target core parts of its business, including one that was filed just yesterday. Those may well clear the way for Microsoft to be the leader in a burgeoning industry with a ton of potential: AI. Companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements in the technology and are now showing it off to the general public, while Google’s competing products are practically nowhere to be found beyond updates on Google’s blog. (Microsoft isn’t entirely in the clear, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently trying to block its massive merger with the gaming company Activision Blizzard, but it’s in a much better position, antitrust-wise.)

That’s not to say that Google doesn’t recognize AI’s potential and increasing importance. It’s been working on AI offerings for years, and has some of the best ones. It acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, before OpenAI even existed. And it developed the Transformer technology that ChatGPT is built on (GPT stands for Generative Prediction Transformer).

But Google has held back on giving them the kind of public demonstration that OpenAI has, saying it wants to ensure that its products are responsible and safe before unleashing them. Not helping matters was a claim from a (now-former) engineer that Google’s chatbot technology, LaMDA, had become sentient. That’s been widely dismissed (and denied by Google), but it underlined how advanced the technology has become. And it showed the risks not of the technology becoming sentient, but of it being so good that people would think it was and start to treat it as such.

Now that ChatGPT is out there, Google has to play catch-up and figure out how it wants to integrate its AI technology into its own offerings. It’s even, reportedly, brought back founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help out. The company also recently published a paper outlining its approach to AI and how important it is for that approach to be responsible (or Google’s definition of responsible, given the lack of government regulations).

“Google is, I think, justified and correct in taking this seriously and taking Microsoft’s bid to use this tech to seriously compete with them in advertising, search engines, and other products,” said Derek Leben, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s business school who focuses on AI ethics. “I think this is a very brilliant move from [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella. This is something that is definitely going to position Microsoft very well.”

But, Leben warned, there remains the question of whether the benefits of these products outweigh their risks — and if rushing them to market to compete will enhance those risks.

“That is indeed the problem with arms races,” he said. “They tend to motivate actors in them to move faster, and accept risks that they otherwise would not have accepted.”

Maybe OpenAI’s technology is a game changer. Maybe it’s just a party trick. Either way, Microsoft’s got it, and a lot of people think it’s amazing. That perception is important. Google now finds itself in a similar position that it helped put Microsoft in two decades ago: hoping it can release something better before it gets passed by.

31,The AI productivity trap: how the 'Blockbuster Effect' may hurt your stock investments,75,14hvwyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hvwyv/the_ai_productivity_trap_how_the_blockbuster/,44,1687620829.0,"**Summary**  
While AI presents vast opportunities for enhancing global economic productivity, it is important to acknowledge that not all companies will thrive or even survive in the face of this revolution. However, it appears that investors are presently embracing an overly optimistic outlook, assuming that virtually every company will automatically reap the rewards of this emerging technology.  
We currently live in the so called “knowledge economy”, a system that values intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation as the primary sources of economic value. Knowledge acts as a potent business moat for established companies, making it challenging for competitors to replicate or access. Thus creating a strong barrier to entry in the market.  
The emergence of AI could potentially lead to a ""knowledge democratization"" phenomenon, gradually dismantling the barriers that currently protect business moats, and thereby impacting the valuations of many popular stocks. This effect, which I refer to as the ""Blockbuster effect,"" entails a scenario where a disruptive technology benefits everyone except those who were initially expected to be the primary beneficiaries of such innovations.

  
**The actual post**  
Over the past decades, the concept of the ""knowledge economy"" has gained prominence, emphasizing the significance of knowledge generation, acquisition, and utilization in driving economic growth and development. In this transformed economic landscape, the primary source of value has shifted from traditional factors like raw materials and physical labor to intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation.  
Within this context, knowledge can be viewed as a valuable business moat. It represents a company's unique expertise, insights, or intellectual property that are not easily replicated or acquired by competitors, thereby creating a barrier to entry.  
Smaller companies and startups often face challenges in competing with larger corporations due to limited financial resources. They may struggle to invest in research and development, hire highly skilled professionals, or acquire advanced technologies, which can hinder their ability to develop and leverage knowledge-based assets. In contrast, larger corporations benefit from well-established networks, partnerships with industry leaders, and research institutions, granting them access to valuable knowledge, market insights, and collaborative opportunities. These advantages strengthen their competitive position.  
In my perspective, the modern corporate world is heavily influenced by the monopolization of knowledge. However, AI has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift by democratizing knowledge, which could prove detrimental to many well-established companies. If AI succeeds, it may enable smaller companies to compete with industry leaders in the medium term. In the long term, we might witness a guerrilla war where market leaders contend with numerous small or micro companies.  
In this hypothetical scenario, the global economy becomes highly productive, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, increased productivity does not automatically translate into higher stock valuations, and the opposite may be true for many stocks currently traded. I refer to this phenomenon as the ""Blockbuster effect"" or the ""Blockbusterization"" of the economy, in honor of the defunct video rental company that was essentially rendered obsolete by the internet.  
During the late 1990s, computers and the internet were introduced as transformative technologies that would reshape the corporate landscape and enhance productivity, which indeed happened. The democratization of information brought about significant societal and economic changes. While many existing companies benefited greatly from this revolution, others became redundant or remained as struggling entities awaiting the next downturn.  
Blockbuster serves as a notable example. The internet greatly enhanced the productivity of the entertainment industry, benefiting society at large. However, it also swiftly eradicated Blockbuster's core assets and competitive advantages. For instance, Blockbuster had an extensive network of exclusive movie rental deals with major producers such as Warner Bros., Disney, and Paramount, which ensured early access to popular titles and fostered customer loyalty. However, with the rise of streaming platforms, many of these partners established their own direct channels, rendering Blockbuster's exclusive deals irrelevant. Other once-relevant moats, such as well-located stores and an extensive movie catalog, also lost their significance.  
Blockbuster stock performed quite well during the dot-com bubble and reached its all-time high in early 2002. Investors seemingly believed that Blockbuster could leverage its dominant market position and embrace the wonders of computers and the internet at the core of its business. However, it is unclear why they were so optimistic, considering that Blockbuster primarily served as an intermediary between studios and consumers, lacking distinctiveness beyond physical rentals. Investors seemingly failed to distinguish between the broader societal and economic impacts of technology and its specific implications for their investment.   
While Blockbuster is a prominent example, countless lesser-known companies and entire industries faced similar fates. The internet revolutionized entire layers of intermediaries that existed before personal computers and the internet.  
In my viewpoint, there seems to be a pervasive tendency to haphazardly incorporate the potential productivity gains driven by AI into the valuations of every company. This mirrors the past mistake made by Blockbuster's investors, who assumed that the mere greatness of a new technology for society and the overall economy would guarantee its benefits for their favored stocks or indices.  
Furthermore, it is crucial to delve into related matters that surpass the scope of this discussion. For instance, it is worth examining why there is a widespread belief that the ""Magnificent Seven Stocks"" will inevitably derive substantial benefits from, or even survive, the AI revolution. Additionally, one should consider the possibility that the true victors of the AI revolution have yet to emerge, transcending existing players in the market.

  
**My advice for the future**  
Right now we are getting bombarded with AI hype, FOMO and 90s like irrational exuberance, my advice can be summed up as follows.    
1-Exercise prudence when factoring in prospective productivity improvements into the current market leaders. This task is intricate and carries a considerable risk of filling your portfolio with overvalued stocks.  
2-Maintain an open-minded approach, acknowledging the possibility that many present-day market leaders could face redundancy or obsolescence in the medium or even near future, despite the overall stability of the economy and markets.   
3-Don't let AI distract you from important macroeconomic trends happening in the present hoping the irruption of AI changes it all. Same happened in the dot com era, people talked about this “new era” where even basic stuff like P/E ratios or the yield curve inversion were no longer relevant, but it was. God knows it was. "
32,Microsoft Q3 Earnings - Room for improvement,54,135m5t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/135m5t5/microsoft_q3_earnings_room_for_improvement/,6,1683036276.0,"Microsoft surpassed everyone’s expectations with their latest Q3’23 earnings, by beating estimates on their top line revenue and bottom-line net income. Although their growth rates for azured has slowed to 27% from 31%, the growth rate was still better than expectation. Nevertheless, the CEO Satya Nadella has whetted investors’ appetite during the earnings call by announcing the phase of growth for azure, which is Azure OpenAI. With the success of ChatGPT around the world, businesses are excited on the introduction of the Azure OpenAI, which would lead to further revenue growth for Microsoft.

AI-Integration of their product offerings has kept the growth story strong for Microsoft. Prior to their quarterly earnings release, shareholders were worried that Microsoft’s growth would come to a halt, and that this would sink the share price given that they are still currently priced to grow at double digits for years to come. Through this quarter earnings, Microsoft has proved that they are able to integrated AI to their current product offering successfully.

While Microsoft has produced a stellar quarter, there is still some room for improvement due to the share buybacks and dividend increase not keeping up with their growth. While it is debatable that they are increasing their R&D spend for AI, Microsoft has been generating lots of free cash flow, and they can look into providing shareholder value through higher share buybacks or increasing their dividends.

33,Morgan Stanley Taps ChatGPT’s Maker to Build AI System for Advisors,51,11sf3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11sf3ek/morgan_stanley_taps_chatgpts_maker_to_build_ai/,3,1678927816.0,"https://www.barrons.com/amp/advisor/articles/morgan-stanley-chatgpt-open-ai-artificial-intelligence-advisors-377b072f

Morgan Stanley is working with OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, to develop an artificial intelligence resource for its financial advisors.

Morgan Stanley describes the planned technology as an “internal-facing service” that will mine the company’s in-house content—research reports, analyst notes, comparative asset models, etc.—to help advisors better serve their clients.

Jeff McMillan, head of analytics, data, and innovation at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, says the firm had evaluated hundreds of start-ups and technology vendors to develop an artificial intelligence product that at once benefits advisors and improves the client experience while also adhering to compliance requirements.

Among all those considered, “OpenAI stands out,” McMillan says in a statement.

“The work we are doing with them will allow us to bring our expansive intellectual capital into the hands of our financial advisors in seconds,” he says. “It will be like having our chief investment strategist, chief global economist, and global equities strategist on call for every financial advisor 24/7.”

The application positions Morgan Stanley as an early adopter of GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s language software. Morgan Stanley says it is the only company in wealth management working with OpenAI to receive early access to its products.

The technology is currently in testing with Morgan Stanley advisors, with a full rollout planned for late spring or early summer, McMillan tells Barron’s Advisor.

The artificial intelligence application, which Morgan Stanley has yet to name, draws exclusively on the firm’s own materials, meaning that it’s cordoned off from the public internet.

But Morgan Stanley’s own body of content is vast. The company expects the new AI application to help advisors to quickly find the most relevant materials to produce better recommendations for clients.

“It allows advisors to instantaneously source and analyze our intellectual capital in ways that would have historically been quite time consuming,” McMillan says. “It’s essentially like having the smartest experts at Morgan Stanley on speed dial.”

So how would the AI tool help advisors in practice? McMillan offers a few examples. An advisor might ask it how best to explain to clients the difference between an earnings recession and an economic recession. More basically, an advisor might ask the program what a Morgan Stanley analyst’s outlook is for the S&P 500, and why.

Other potential queries, per McMillan:

“What are Morgan Stanley’s rates on CDs and what are some alternative products available to my clients who are seeking yield?”

“Tell me the top-rated technology stocks by our research department, and compare and contrast the risk and reward for each.”

Morgan Stanley puts any new technology through rigorous compliance testing before rolling it out widely across the firm, and the AI application is no different. Morgan Stanley is developing its AI application in concert with the firm’s legal, risk, and compliance teams to incorporate “appropriate safeguards and controls,” McMillan says.

There isn’t a client-facing side to the new technology, which McMillan describes as “an internal research tool for our advisors,” though it is very much intended to directly inform their work with clients.

“[T]o be clear,” he says, “this is designed to help our advisors more efficiently and intelligently communicate with their clients, so it is involved with client interactions, albeit through our advisors.”"

Is it really going to boost profits like the hype?,40,13vuikf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13vuikf/msft_is_baking_in_massive_ai_revenue_streams_is/,78,1685463220.0,"Long term holder of MSFT here. To be fair I think MSFT is making a good move getting out in front of this trend and getting a big foothold in the industry. However cool the tech is I find it very hard to believe the stock run up is warranted to this level based on what I saw at build. Couple of points I think ""bear"" considering.

1. How many employers are going to pay extra for these features is the near future? My company has blocked most things AI citing fears of client data leaks and misuse. (co-piot, bing chat)
2. How big of a revenue boost will this really be? There is a lot of computational hardware in use behind the scenes. If you have power users hitting this all day how much is being kept in profit?
3. Azure Open AI seems to have some good use cases, but a lot of the demonstrated cases are around chat bots. Are chat bots worth a 35X + multiplier on this 2 trillion plus stock?

My view is more that MSFT has to do this to ensure they stay in the game not that this will be a major major revenue driver. For a company this large thinking PE of 35 is a bit lofty. But then again I've been reminded by some that MR Market tends to throw fundamentals to the wind when the hype gets big and we can grow into this multiplier...it just might be a bit."

> Stocks cut much of their earlier losses Friday as investors looked past hotter-than-expected labor data to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up just 34.87 points, or 0.1%, to 34,429.88 points after hitting a session low of more than 350 points down. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to 4,071.70, rebounding from an earlier loss of 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also made up ground to end nearly 0.2% lower at 11,461.50 points. The tech-heavy index dropped as much as 1.6% earlier in the day.
*****
> All three indexes set weekly gains, with the Nasdaq posting the largest increase at nearly 2.1%. The S&P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow ticked up by 0.2%. Friday’s close marked the first time the three major indexes notched back-to-back weekly gains since October.
*****
> Stocks dipped after labor data released Friday morning showed payrolls rose by 263,000 in November, a bigger gain than the 200,000 increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Average hourly earnings also came in above expectations, jumping 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% against the same month a year ago. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.
*****
> The market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on. Market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as December.
*****
> “Just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after Powell’s speech,” said Anna Han, vice president at Wells Fargo Securities. “He’s confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation, so I think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off.”
*****
> It was the final monthly employment report before the Fed’s two-day meeting Dec. 13-14, in which the central bank is expected to slow to a 50 basis point interest rate hike from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent months.

> But with the big 3.1% gain in the S&P 500 on November 30, the YTD loss receded above the -15% mark to -14.4% on the heels of a 5.4% gain for the month, which is also a 14.1 percent rally off the October 12 low. And this marks the first back-to-back monthly gains of over 5% each month since August 2020, the ones before that were in March-May 2009. It’s the 14th such occurrence since 1950. The previous 13 all occurred in bull markets.

> Now, when the S&P 500 is down YTD November less than 15%, December’s performance is not so bad at all, just a tad below the average 1.6% to 1.1%, up 17 of 23 or 74% of the time. We still expect some chop as the bull market finds its footing, but we remain bullish and anticipate the yearend rally to continue to climb the proverbial “wall of worry” and for the Santa Claus Rally to come to town.

> # Country ETFs Outperforming US Recently

> For most major global equity markets, at some point this Fall a 52-week low has been put in place, with significant rallies since then. As shown below, of the 22 ETFs tracking key country stock markets in our Global Macro Dashboard, the average gain off the low is now 22%. The largest of these rallies have come from Germany (EWG), Italy (EWI), and China (MCHI), which have all risen over 30%. For China, that gain has come in the shortest span of time with October 31st being its low, whereas Italy and Germany's lows were a few weeks further back. One other interesting note regarding China is currently it trades only slightly above its 50-DMA whereas a majority of other country ETFs are in or at least near overbought territory. On the other end of the spectrum, the US (SPY) has experienced the most modest rally having only risen 13.82%. India (INDA) is close behind with a 13.89% gain, although it bottomed before the rest of the world with its 52-week low being back on June 17th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120122-GMD-1.png))**

> While much of the rest of the world has experienced a larger rebound off the lows, year to date performance between the US (SPY) and global equities excluding the US—proxied by the MSCI All World ex. US ETF (CWI)—is now very similar. The US is marginally in the lead with a -14.12% YTD total return versus a 14.45% drop for CWI. At the lows at the end of Q3, international markets were underperforming the US by more than 5 percentage points, but that gap has been closed during the current rally.

> # Five Good Signs for The Bulls In 2023

> Can you believe it? We made it to December! As we noted yesterday, we wouldn’t be surprised if we finished this year with some more green, but today we’ll look into the future and what could be in store in 2023.

> First things first, let’s start with something simple. Stocks will likely be lower this year; we can all agree there. How likely is the S&P 500 to be down two years in a row? The bottom line, it is pretty rare for back-to-back yearly losses, and we don’t expect it to happen this time either. In fact, over the past 50 years, it has only happened twice. There was a three-year losing streak after the tech bubble burst in 2000, 2001, and 2002, then back-to-back losses during the vicious recession of 1973 and 1974. So it ‘could’ happen, but we don’t see many similarities between now and those two times, suggesting next year should be a bounce-back year for stocks.

> Another potential positive is that when the S&P 500 is lower during a midterm year (like we will likely see in 2022), the following year has been extremely strong. Since 1950, the year after a negative midterm year saw the S&P 500 higher all eight times, with a very impressive yearly return of 24.6%. Looking at the past 50 years, things are even better, as the ‘worst’ next year was 26.3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture1.png))**

> Thirdly, and somewhat similar to above, pre-election years historically are very strong for stocks, with the S&P 500 up 16.8% on average and higher 88.9% of the time. Midterm years are the worst, which clearly played out this year. All in all, that’s something for bulls to be excited about in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-800x407.png))**

> Fourth, we hear a lot about how a recession is coming in 2023, but we aren’t so sure. Sonu did a great job discussing some of this here and here.

> The bottom line to us is that the consumer makes up 70% of the economy, and is still in good shape and spending. But could a recession start next year? Well, history would say it would be rare. That’s right, we found that out of the past 13 recessions, none started in a pre-election year. Full disclosure, we did see recessions begin in January in 1970 and 2008, so those were just a month away. But all in all, this is another potential positive for the bulls in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture3.png))**

> Lastly, stocks soared yesterday as investors realize that the Fed will likely end their series of aggressive rate hikes potentially quite soon. As a result of yesterday’s big move, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than seven months. We took a look, and this could be potentially quite bullish.

> As you can see here, previous times that saw streaks end at least six months beneath the 200-day moving average resulted in solid performance going forward. In fact, since 1950, only one out of 13 times stocks went on to make new lows, which was in 2002.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture4.png))**

> Here are the longest streaks beneath the 200-day moving average and what happened once the streak ended. Up 18.8% a year later and higher more than 92% of the time is one thing that could have bulls smiling in 2023.

> # Will Santa Bring Jolly or Coal to Investors This December?

> Can you believe it? We’ve made it to the last month of the year! I don’t know about you all, but I’ll be pretty happy to wish 2022 goodbye as soon as possible. But the good news is that we continue to think the mid-October lows were the lows from the bear market, and continued good times could be coming. I’ll break down some positive signs tomorrow on the blog, but today I’ll show why there’s a chance Santa will come to town and bring some green with him this December.

> First things first, December is historically known as one of the best months for investors, and this is true. Only once did the S&P 500 see December turn out to be the worst month of the year. That was in 2018 when the Fed made one rate hike too many, and investors weren’t very festive about things, sending December down a record 9.2%.

> As the chart shows below, December is still up over the past ten years (so including that massive drop in 2018), and that is mainly because the past three years, this final month has gained 2.9%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively. Looking further, it ranks as the third-best month since 1950, with only April and November better. In fact, until 2018, this month was historically the best. Lastly, in a midterm year, October is the best month, November is the second best, and December is the third best.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-800x338.png))**

> Some other things to know:
> * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.
> * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
> * Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.
> * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.
> * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #2!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dec-worst-mo-of-year-800x339.png))**

> The bottom line is that with inflation likely peaking, the U.S. dollar weakening, positive seasonals, a potentially more dovish Fed, investors still extremely bearishly positioned (bullish from a contrarian point of view), broadening overall market participation, a stronger than expected consumer, and crude oil back to near flat for the year, there are many former headwinds, which have now become potential tailwinds. When all is said and done with 2022, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this year end higher than where it is today.

> # A Popular Recession Indicator is Flashing Bright Red. Should We Worry?

> A political strategist once said that if there were reincarnation, he would want to come back as the bond market. “You can intimidate everybody,” as he put it. With good reason, investors watch bond markets carefully for all sorts of signals about the economy, monetary policy, and inflation.

> And right now, a key signal from the bond market – the yield curve – is flashing bright red, warning about impending recession. The yield curve is simply a curve showing interest rates on US treasury bonds across various maturities. Yields on the short end of the curve, i.e., smaller maturities, typically rise and fall depending on what investors expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to do over the next year or two. Interest rates on the long end of the curve, with maturities of 5 years or more, are typically higher than those on the short end. If investors anticipate higher growth and inflation, they will demand much higher interest rates, widening the “spread” of difference between short and long-term yields.

> In extreme cases, we get inverted yield curves, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. This normally does not make intuitive sense since it implies that long-term investors, who face more uncertainty and risk, are settling for less compensation than short-term investors. It typically happens when the Fed raises interest rates to prevent overheating of an economy (like they have this year), while bond market investors kind of take the opposing view – believing that the Fed will go too far and push the economy into recession, which would be accompanied by much lower inflation and hence, lower long-term yields.

> The yield curve inverted prior to the last ten recessions, with just one false signal in 1965. The table below shows yield curve inversions (as defined by the 10-year/1-year spread turning negative), along with the timing of the recession that followed. No surprise that this is a favored recession indicator.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-yield-curve-inversions-table-800x679.png))**

> The chart below shows how the 10-year/1-year spread has gone negative prior to the shaded bars, i.e., recessions. The bad news is that this spread inverted back in July of this year and is currently at its most negative, or “inverted state,” since 1982. Indicating a recession is on the horizon if you consider the historical precedent.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-picture-yield-spread-602x800.png))**

> # What does it really tell us, beyond “Yes, Recession”
> One thing you notice from the table and chart above is that while a recession has followed inversion, the degree of inversion doesn’t say anything about the following:
> * When a recession will start – the start time has varied from 7 to 24 months
> * How long the recession will last – we had prolonged recessions in 1974 and 2008, and the degree of inversion was quite different prior to these
> * How deep the recession will be – the degree of inversion was similar prior to the 2001 and 2008 recessions, but these were very different economic drawdowns
> Another huge caveat I would add to the track record: the inversion in 2019 technically preceded the 2020 recession, but it didn’t really “predict” it in that it didn’t predict Covid-19.

> Also, the yield curve has a bit of a dubious record outside the US, as this study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve points out. Several yield curve inversions occurred in the U.K. and Canada that did not predate recessions, i.e., you had a lot of false signals. But it worked better in the US, France, and Germany.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-st-louis-fed-study-inversions-800x575.png))**

> # A symptom rather than a cause
> Yield curve inversion is more of a symptom rather than a cause. The logic is that the Fed tightening too far leads to an expectation of slower economic growth (or recession), which leads to lower inflation expectations (there’s less demand for goods and services). Which in turn results in long-term yields falling below short-term yields. To a first approximation, long-term yields are simply the expected path of future short-term rates, i.e., monetary policy. And so, if inflation is expected to be lower in the future, especially amidst a recession, you would expect the Fed to reduce rates.

> Note that higher rates can take their toll on the economy. For example, housing activity can decline amid higher mortgage rates, and businesses may cut back on spending/hiring if they find borrowing terms to be much higher. But these usually occur only with a lag – which is why a recession doesn’t follow immediately after the Fed raises rates and yield curves invert.

> # Look toward inflation expectations
> With respect to yield curve inversions, a lot of it comes down to inflation expectations. Inflation expectations can fall if investors expect a recession.

> But, longer-term inflation expectations can also be lower than short-term inflation expectations if inflation has surged recently and investors believe it to be a short-term phenomenon. Sound familiar?

> It’s not easy to directly gauge inflation expectations, but we can calculate them using securities called inflation swaps. Without getting into too much detail, these are used to transfer inflation risk from one entity to another. You have swaps ranging over various periods, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which can tell you what investors expect inflation to average over these periods.

> The chart below shows 1-year inflation expectations versus 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectations. The latter is the inflation expectation over the 9-year period that begins one year from now – my goal is to separate short-term inflation expectations from longer-term expectations. As you can see, 1-year inflation expectations surged above longer-term expectations over the past 18-20 months. Prior to 2021, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation was mostly above the 1-year. But they’re converging again, with investors expecting inflation to average about 2.7% over the next year. At the same time, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is just under 2.6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-inflation-expectations-592x800.png))**

> What also comes out of the graph is that during the 2008 and 2020 recessions, 1-year inflation expectations collapsed well below the longer-term series. Based on that, it doesn’t look like markets are expecting a recession now.
> * 1-year inflation expectations are still slightly above the 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectation
> * 1-year/9-year expectations have barely fallen, in contrast to what we saw in 2008 and 2020 when they were below 2%
> Could we be headed for stagflation, i.e., a recession with high inflation? Well, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is around 2.6% right now – it doesn’t exactly scream stagflation, let alone high inflation.

> To wrap up, the yield curve may be as inverted as it is today because the Fed is hiking short-term rates even as long-term yields fall on the back of lower inflation expectations – in a sense vindicating the rate hikes. However, there are other factors, including a reversal of supply-chain-related issues that pushed inflation higher in the first place. My colleague, Ryan Detrick, and I have written quite a lot about why we think inflation is off the boil (see here and here).

> And just as important, inflation expectations beyond a year are not pointing toward a deflationary recession or stagflation, for that matter.

> Of course, investors could be wrong, and things could change in a hurry. This is something I’ll be watching closely.

> # Typical December Seasonal Pattern Begins Dull Pops Mid-Month

> December’s first trading day has been bearish for S&P 500 and Russell 1000 over the last 21 years. A modest rally through the fifth or sixth trading day also has fizzled going into mid-month. It is around this point that holiday cheer tends to kick in and propel the indexes higher with a pause near month-end.

> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect, 2023 Almanac pages 112 &114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2023 Almanac page 18), which states as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

> The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on December 23 and lasts until the second trading day of 2023. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. The “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) was invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac.

> This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # December #2 Small Cap #3 Large Cap Tepid Start Solid Finish

> Trading in December is holiday-inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins.

> December is the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. It’s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and fourth best for NASDAQ (1971). It is also the third best month for Russell 1000 (1979).

> In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 does not seem highly likely this year.

> When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/622df92caae1f1d36246081b8c04ec3f/19c407a38165e76c-b2/s400x600/a5ece9d71341061ea8853d22d94d38c5b51b9519.jpg))**

> In the last eighteen midterm years, December’s rankings slip modestly to #5 DJIA (0.9%), #3 S&P 500 (1.2%) and #7 NASDAQ (–0.3% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also tend to soften in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just three times in ten midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is 0.3%. Midterm December performance had been stronger prior to previously mentioned December 2018.

# [Stock futures rise as S&P 500 and Dow try to bounce back from lowest levels since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/stock-futures-are-little-changed-after-sp-500-closes-at-lowest-level-since-2020.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
> S&P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
> The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
> Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
> Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
> The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
> “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
> On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

37,Prove me wrong: It'd be a huge mistake not to hold stocks for the long term because of AI,32,13cj1uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13cj1uu/prove_me_wrong_itd_be_a_huge_mistake_not_to_hold/,129,1683618749.0,"**Main thesis:**

* Companies can save exponentially more money with AI.
* For example, as a company, you used to have to pay $85/hr and a total of 10 hours ($850 total) to write a good blog post for marketing. With LLMs (large language models), you can generate an article and ask your writer to spend one hour editing it. The cost to produce a blog post of similar quality went from $850 to $85 and the speed to produce it went from 2 days to 1 hour. Evidence that this is already happening: [https://reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12ff5mw/it\_happened\_to\_me\_today/](https://old.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/12ff5mw/it_happened_to_me_today/)
* It's rare to see an exponential increase in productivity like the above. Perhaps this kind of tech comes around every 50 years? Steam engine, electricity, internet level of impact.
* Soon, many workers will be exponentially more productive.
* Things that used to cost a lot of money to produce will be cheap.
* We're starting to get generative AI in video games, movies, music, programming, etc. as well. Even Excel and Powerpoint are getting generative AI.
* I'm a software engineer. Github CoPilot is incredibly good at helping me write code signficantly faster.
* Like the iPhone which made many workers significantly more efficient and opened entirely new industries, AI can and will likely do the same.
* Thus, corporations and stocks will benefit.
* Corporations will hire less and produce more - leading to greater profit margins and/or higher revenues.
* There will obviously be big losers and big winners but as a whole, I expect S&P 500 to continue to marge towards greater profitability and a bigger total market cap.
* GDP/year is a measure of products and services produced in a year. I expect significantly more products and services to be produced with AI than without AI. Hence, I expect GDP to accelerate.

**Other examples of LLM/AI usage to save on cost or increase speed or both:**

* Studies are now showing that GPT4 is more accurate than a doctor at diagnosing diseases, including rare diseases.
* GPT4 is often better than a lawyer at finding laws, drafting documents, compliance, and legal research. If you're a giant corporation, you now have to hire fewer lawyers.
* LLMs is faster and often better at tier 1 customer service. Combine LLMs with an AI voice and you have phone support too. Customer service is often one of the larger expenses at a company. You can replace your entire tier 1 customer service department and just hire a few advanced tier 2 people.
* LLMs can tutor your kids with their homework. Previously, you had to hire an expensive tutor.
* In HR, LLMs can now find quality candidates for you automatically - instead of paying humans to sift through thousands of resumes or spend weeks looking through LinkedIn.
* Within my own industry, I'm giving GPT4 access to my database and it's automatically generating business insights for me based on my data. This means I don't have to hire business analysts/data scientists or as many of them.

We're only 5 months into the ChatGPT era.

# **Dow leaps 700 points on hot jobs report, Nasdaq notches sixth straight winning week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Friday as traders cheered a strong jobs report and the passage of a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow jumped 701.19 points, or 2.12%, to end at 33,762.76 — its best day since January. The S&P 500 climbed 1.45% to close at 4,282.37. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.07% to 13,240.77, reaching its highest level since April 2022 during the session.
*****
> With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished the holiday-shortened trading week about 1.8% and 2% higher, respectively. The Dow’s Friday advance pushed it into positive territory for the week, finishing up around 2%. The Nasdaq notched its sixth straight week higher, a streak length not seen for the technology-heavy index since 2020.
*****
> Nonfarm payrolls grew much more than expected in May, rising 339,000. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a relatively modest 190,000 increase. It marked the 29th straight month of positive job growth.
*****
> Recently strong employment data had been pressuring stocks on the notion it would keep the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. But Friday data also showed average hourly earnings rose less than economists expected year over year, while the unemployment rate was higher than anticipated.
*****
> Both data points have given investors hope that the Fed could pause its interest rate hike campaign at the policy meeting later this month, according to Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
*****
> “The so-called Goldilocks has entered the house,” Sandven said. “Clearly, on the bullish side, there are signs that inflation is starting to wane, speculation that the Fed is going to move into pause mode, increasing the likelihood of a soft landing.”
*****
> Easing concerns around the U.S. debt ceiling also helped sentiment. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday night, sending the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. That comes after the House passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday, just days before the June 5 deadline set by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*****
> Lululemon shares popped more than 11% on strong results and a guidance boost, while MongoDB surged 28% on a blowout forecast.

> # A Resilient Labor Market = A Resilient Economy

> Another month, another employment surprise. Should we be surprised anymore?

> Economists expected payrolls to grow by about 187,000 in May. That’s still a solid job growth number, but a stepdown from what we’ve seen this year through April. However, actual payroll growth beat expectations for the 14th straight month.

> The economy created 339,000 jobs in May, close to double expectations. Better still, payroll growth in March and April were revised higher by a total of 93,000!

> * March payrolls were revised up by 52,000, from 165,000 to 217,000
> * April payroll were revised up by 41,000, from 253,000 to 294,000

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-monthly-payroll-growth-601x800.png))**

> We’ve got two months of payroll data since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March, and nothing suggests weakness arising from that banking crisis.

> Over the first five months of the year, the economy’s added 1.5 million jobs. That in a nutshell tells you how the economy is doing. For perspective, the average annual payroll growth between 1940 and 2022 was 1.5 million. During the last expansion, 2010-2019, average annual payroll growth was 2.2 million per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-annual-job-growth-612x800.png))**

> **But what about the unemployment rate?**

> The unemployment rate did rise from a 50-year low of 3.4% to 3.7%. This does raise some cause for concern but digging through the data suggests it may be noise more than anything else.

> It probably helps to understand that the job growth and unemployment rate data come from different sources. The former comes from asking about 120,000+ businesses how many people they hired. The latter comes from asking about 60,000 households about their employment status. No surprise, the latter is noisier.

> A big reason for the weak household survey (and rising unemployment rate) is that more than 400,000 people who were self-employed said they were no longer employed. As you can see in the following chart this is very noisy data, but the recent trend seems to be toward lower self-employment. It’s basically reversing the surge we saw in 2021, when self-employment surged. So, what we’re seeing now may simply be normalization of the labor market as more workers move from self-employment to W2 jobs with an employer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-self-employment-600x800.png))**

> Also, the unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

> The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio dropped only a tick, from 80.8% to 80.7%. This still leaves it higher than at any point between 2002 and 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-prime-age-employment-population-ratio-614x800.png))**

> All in all, the labor market remains strong and resilient, despite all the recession calls. Perhaps its not as strong as the headline payroll growth number of 339,000 suggests, but any number above 150,000 would be good at this point. And we’re certainly well above that.

> In fact, looking at the job growth and employment-population data, this labor market is probably the strongest we’ve seen since the late 1990’s. Our view since the end of last year has been that the economy can avoid a recession this year, and nothing we’ve seen to date suggests we need to reverse that view. Far from it.

> Since 1971 June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking eighth best with an 0.8% average gain, up 29 of 52 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best 8 Months” which ends in June. Small caps also fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in June since 1979 advancing 63.6% of the time.

> June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.02% average gain).

> Despite being much stronger S&P 500 pre-election year June ranks fifth best. For the rest it is just sixth best. Average monthly gains in pre-election year June range from DJIA 1.1% to a respectable 2.4% for NASDAQ. Russell 2000 has been the most consistently bullish in pre-election years, up 8 of the last 11 (72.7% of the time).

> # The June Swoon?

> Stocks did it again, as the S&P 500 gained 0.2% in the month of May, making it now 10 of the past 11 years that stocks finished green in May. Of course, it gained only 0.01% last year and only 0.25% this year, so the recent returns weren’t off the charts by any measure.

> Looking specifically at this year, tech added more than 9% in May, thanks to excitement over AI and Nvidia, with communication services and consumer discretionary also in the green, while the other eight sectors were lower.

> Specifically, turning to the month of June, stocks historically have hit a bit of trouble here. Since 1950, up 0.03% on average, the fourth worst month of the year. Over the past 20 years, only January and September have been worse and in the past decade, it is again the fourth worst month. The one bit of good news is during a pre-election year is it up 1.5%, the fifth-best month of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-800x338.png))**

> Here’s another chart we’ve shared before, but years that gained big in January (like 2023) tend to see some periods of consolidation in late May/early June, but eventually experience a surge higher into July. Given the flattish overall May, this could be playing out again.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-800x278.png))**

> What if stocks were having a good year heading into June? Since 1950, if the S&P 500 was up more than 8% for the year going into June (like this year), the month of June was up an impressive 1.2% on average versus the average June return of 0.03%, while in a pre-election year the returns jumped to 1.8%. The percent of the time where returns were higher gets better as well, from 54.8% in your average June to nearly 74% if up 8% or more for the year heading into June, to 80% of the time higher if up 8% for the year in a pre-election year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-800x342.png))**

> Overall, it has been a very nice run for stocks this year and we remain overweight stocks in the Carson Investment Research House Views. June could potentially cause some volatility, but when all is said and done, we wouldn’t bet against more strength and higher prices in June.

*****

> # NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Lead June Pre-Election Strength

> Over the last 21 years, June has been a rather lackluster month. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. Russell 2000 has fared better with a modest average gain. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days.

> From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and returned to losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally led by technology and small caps.

> Historical performance in pre-election years has been much stronger with all five indexes finishing with average gains. June’s overall pattern in pre-election is similar to the last 21-years pattern with a brief, shallow pullback after a solid start.

> In pre-election years the mid-month rally has been much more robust beginning around the sixth trading day and lasting until the fifteenth. Followed by another modest retreat and rally into the end of Q2.

> # May and YTD 2023 Asset Class Performance

> May 2023 is now behind us, and below is a look at how various asset classes performed during the month using US-listed exchange-traded products as proxies. We also include YTD and YoY total returns.

> May was a month of divergence where Tech/AI soared, and the rest of the market fell. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) gained 7.88% in May while the Dow Jones Dividend ETF (DVY) fell 7.7%. That's a 15 percentage-point spread!

> At the sector level, it was a similar story. While the Tech sector (XLK) rose 8.9%, sectors like Energy (XLE), Consumer Staples (XLP), Materials (XLB), and Utilities (XLU) fell more than 5%. In total, 8 of 11 sectors were in the red for the month.

> Outside the US, we saw pullbacks in most areas of the world other than Brazil, India, and Japan. China, Hong Kong, France, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the UK all fell more than 5%.

> All of the commodity-related ETFs/ETNs were in the red for May, with oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) falling the most at more than 10% each.

> Finally, fixed-income ETFs also fell in May as interest rates bounced back. The aggregate bond market ETF (AGG) was down 1.14% in May, leaving it up just 2.6% YTD and down 2.2% year-over-year.

> # How Worried Should We Be About Consumer Debt?

> A very common question we get these days is whether we’re concerned about the massive increase in consumer debt.

> Short answer: No. Well, not yet anyway. But let’s walk through it in 6 charts.

> The New York Federal Reserve (NY Fed) releases a quarterly report on household debt and credit, and the latest one that was released last week came with the headline:

> “Household Debt Hits $17.05 Trillion in First Quarter.”
> But let’s look at the details. Household debt increased by $148 billion in Q1. That translates to a 0.9% increase, which is the slowest quarterly increase in two years. Most of the increase in debt was from mortgage originations ($121 billion) – mortgage debt makes up $12 trillion of the total $17 trillion in debt. The rest was auto loan and student loan balances.

> Here’s something interesting: credit card balances were flat in Q1, at $986 billion. The fact that overall balances are higher than where they were in 2019 ($927 billion) should not be surprising given we just experienced a lot of inflation. Prices rose at the fastest pace in 40 years, and so you should expect card balances to increase. However, incomes rose as well.

> When you think debt, the key question is whether households are able to service that debt. A good measure of that is to look at debt service costs as a percent of disposable income. As of Q4 2022, that’s at 9.7%, slightly lower than what it was before the pandemic and well below the historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-debt-service-disposable-income-608x800.png))**

> There’s even better news: disposable income grew 2.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Significantly higher than the 0.9% increase in total household debt, let alone interest costs!

> Part of that includes the large boost to social security income due to inflation adjustments in January. Also, tax brackets were adjusted higher, resulting in more money in household wallets.

> But even if you exclude these one-off increases, disposable income growth has been strong between February and April, rising at a 5% annualized pace. In fact, employee compensation by itself has risen at a 3.9% annualized pace over the past three months. Meanwhile, inflation is running just about 3% – which means households are seeing real income gains (adjusted for inflation).

> This is why consumers don’t feel the need to borrow to the extent they did before the pandemic. Credit utilization rates measure credit card balances as a percent of available credit. As you can see in the following chart, utilization rates for both credit cards and home equity lines of credit are well below pre-pandemic averages.

> **Lack of stress showing in delinquency data as well**

> Another way to look for signs of consumer stress is to look at the debt delinquency data. As of the first quarter, the NY Fed survey showed that the percent of loan balances that were more than 90 days delinquent was stable around 1.5%. That’s down from 1.9% a year ago, and quite a bit below the 3% average in 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-balances-by-delinquency-status-800x580.png))**

> Even third-party collections are at record lows, with just over 5% of consumers having collections against them as of the first quarter. This is down from 6% a year ago and below the 2019 average of 9.2%. The average collection amount per person is $1,316, which is lower than the $1,452 average in late 2019. This is surprising because just with inflation you’d have thought the amount would be higher.

> All in all, the data on consumer finances is not showing much cause for concern. So, count us in the “not worried” camp. At least, not yet.

> # Some Good Inflation News

> While the market prices in a much higher likelihood of a rate hike at the June meeting, there was actually some decent news on the inflation front today. Starting with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence report, in this month's update, the inflation expectations component fell to 6.1% from a peak of 7.9% fifteen months ago in March 2022 (first time reading touched 7.9%). Looking at the chart below, this reading was also at 6.1% fifteen months before that first peak. In other words, for all the talk about how inflation has been stickier, the pace of decline in this indicator on the way down has been the same as the pace of increase on the way up.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/053023-Conference-Board1.png))**

> Another notable report was today's release of the Dallas Fed Manufacturing report. The Prices Paid component of that report showed a decline from 19.5 down to 13.8 which was the lowest reading since July 2020. For the month of May, two of the five components (Empire and Philadelphia) showed modest m/m increases from multi-month lows, and three showed significant declines to multi-month lows. The chart below shows a composite of the Prices Paid component using the z-scores for each of the five individual components going back to 2010. The peak for this component was 19 months ago in November 2021. Unlike the inflation expectations of the Conference Board survey, this reading hasn't declined quite as fast as it increased in the 19 months leading up to the peak, but at -0.2, it is still below its historical average dating back to 2010 and back down to levels it was at right before the COVID shock hit the economy in early 2020.

> # Home Prices Bounce in Hardest Hit Areas

> March data on home prices across the country were released today with updated S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller numbers. Case Shiller home prices had been falling rapidly in many of the twenty cities tracked, but in March we actually saw a pretty big month-over-month bounce in some of the hardest-hit areas like San Diego, San Francisco, LA, Denver, and Phoenix. Some cities still saw declines, however. Las Vegas saw a m/m drop of 0.93%, while Miami fell 0.41%, and Seattle fell 0.28%.

> On a year-over-year basis, Miami is still up the most with a gain of 10.86%. As shown in the table below, Miami home prices are up 59.87% from pre-COVID levels in February 2020, and they're only down 2.9% from post-COVID highs. Only Tampa is up more than Miami from pre-COVID levels (+61.04%), but Tampa prices are down more from their post-COVID highs (-4.70%) than Miami (-2.90%).

> Four cities are down more than 10% from their post-COVID highs: San Diego (-10.12%), Las Vegas (-10.95%), San Francisco (-16.35%), and Seattle (-16.50%). New York is down the least from post-COVID highs of any city tracked at just -2.9%.

We've included a vertical red line on each chart to highlight pre-COVID levels. When looking through the charts, you can see this month's small bounce back in most cities after a 6-9 month pullback in prices from peaks seen early last year.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great new trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"
39,Better Buy: Shopify vs. Fiverr International,21,13qcug9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13qcug9/better_buy_shopify_vs_fiverr_international/,25,1684907456.0,"Which of these disruptive platforms is a better long-term investment?

  
Shopify (SHOP -6.01%) and Fiverr International (FVRR -1.39%) both challenge the status quo for selling goods and services. Shopify's e-commerce services enable smaller merchants to set up their own online stores, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their marketing campaigns without joining a crowded online marketplace like Amazon. Meanwhile, Fiverr is a gig economy marketplace that hosts hundreds of categories of writing, coding, media, marketing, and design jobs.  
  
Shopify and Fiverr both saw their stocks hit all-time highs during the buying frenzy in meme and growth stocks throughout 2021. But as of this writing, Shopify and Fiverr trade about 64% and 91%, respectively, below those frothy levels.  
  
Both stocks lost their luster as investors fretted over their slowing growth in a post-pandemic market. Rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth tech stocks.

**Shopify's post-pandemic slowdown could be ending**

  
Shopify's revenue surged 86% in 2020 and grew 57% in 2021 as the pandemic drove more merchants to open online stores and more customers to shop online. Its adjusted net income also jumped 1,332% in 2020 and rose 66% in 2021.

But in 2022, Shopify's revenue only grew 21% as its adjusted net income plunged 94%. Its growth cooled off as the pandemic passed, and it ramped up its spending to expand its lower-margin Shop Pay and logistics businesses. Its acquisitions of 6 River Systems and Deliverr -- which were both aimed at expanding its logistics network -- also crushed its operating margins. That combination of slowing growth and rising costs drove a lot of bulls away from Shopify.

However, Shopify's revenue rose 25% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, and the company unexpectedly announced it would sell its entire logistics division to Flexport in exchange for a 13% stake in the private company. It also plans to lay off approximately 20% of its workforce to complement that divestment and stabilize its operating margins.  
  
Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise about 20% this year as its adjusted EPS soars 675%. That stable outlook suggests it's reached the trough of its cyclical slowdown. Despite all those improvements, Shopify still faces intense competition from other similar services like Amazon's ""Buy with Prime"" buttons for independent merchants, Adobe Commerce, and BigCommerce -- and all that pressure could erode its pricing power and squeeze its gross margins.  
  
**Fiverr's growth is still decelerating**

  
Fiverr's revenue surged 77% in 2020 and rose 57% in 2021 as the pandemic drove more people to accept freelance and contract work. It also turned profitable on an adjusted basis in 2020, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 152% in 2021.

But in 2022, Fiverr's revenue and adjusted net income only rose 13% and 7%, respectively. In 2023, it expects its revenue to rise a mere 5% to 8% -- but it expects its adjusted EBITDA to roughly double as it reins in its spending.

As Fiverr's growth cools off, it faces longer-term concerns about ChatGPT and similar generative artificial intelligence (AI) services displacing a wide range of freelance jobs. CEO Micha Kaufman tried to allay those concerns during the company's latest conference call by saying that it doesn't ""anticipate AI development to displace the need for human talent."" Instead, Kaufman suggested the AI boom will drive a growing need for more freelance AI work for humans -- such as ""verifying and editing"" AI-generated content.  
  
Fiverr also recently launched a dedicated AI services category for those positions. However, Fiverr's growth could stay sluggish for the foreseeable future -- and it still faces intense competition from similar freelance platforms like Upwork.  
  
**The valuations and verdict**

  
Shopify and Fiverr's valuations cooled off a lot after their steep drawdowns. Shopify trades at 11 times this year's sales, while Fiverr trades at just 3 times this year's sales. Meanwhile, Shopify is pricer because brighter days seem right around the corner, while Fiverr seems cheaper because its downturn could easily last for at least another year.

I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. But if I had to pick one, I'd definitely buy Shopify because it's growing faster, it's making tough calls to streamline its business, and it shouldn't be disrupted by the rise of generative AI platforms.  
  
Fiverr could remain a top destination for gig economy workers, but I'm not fully convinced it's immune to the generative AI revolution -- which could easily disrupt a wide range of jobs across the writing, coding, media, and design industries."

# [Stock futures inch higher after House passes debt ceiling bill: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Thursday after the U.S. House passed a debt ceiling bill in a crucial step to avoid a U.S. default, with the measure now moving it to the Senate.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 8 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.2% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
> The Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by a vote of 314-117 with bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he hopes “we can move the bill quickly here in the Senate and bring it to the president’s desk as soon as possible.”
*****
> Concern over a possible U.S. debt default lingered on Wall Street throughout May — which concluded Wednesday. Last month was also marked by a dramatic rally in artificial intelligence-related stocks.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite ended May with a 5.8% gain as enthusiasm around AI continued to boost related stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia jumped 36% in May, briefly touching a $1 trillion market cap this week. Alphabet, Meta and Amazon all rose at least 10% during the month.
*****
> Outside of tech, gains were hard to come by, however. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% in the month, while the blue-chip Dow fell almost 3.5%, dragged down by Nike, Walt Disney and Chevron.
*****
> “We have been impressed by the resilience of this market since the March low, absorbing a relentless onslaught of negative sentiment and headlines,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler.
*****
> Beyond the debt ceiling battle, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s June 13-14 policy meeting as another possible market catalyst. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Wednesday that he’s leaning toward skipping a rate hike at the upcoming gathering. However, he added that Friday’s payrolls report could change his mind.
*****
> A slew of economic data is set for release Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and the purchasing managers’ index.
*****
> Nordstrom jumped 4% in premarket trading after its fiscal first-quarter sales beat Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce shares fell about 6% after the software company bumped up its full-year forecast but reported higher capital expenses than expected.

42,How I see the Future Economic Landscape - A few points to consider and ponder.,17,12cmumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12cmumr/how_i_see_the_future_economic_landscape_a_few/,24,1680706249.0,"# Future Economic Landscape

I believe that the world is heading to an inflationary regime (which can last decades). But that doesn’t mean it will be inflationary throughout, there will be periods of disinflation, deflation, and reinflation peppered within this inflationary regime, just like how we had a deflationary regime over the last four decades that was peppered with periods of disinflation, deflation, and reinflation.

**So why are we heading to an inflationary regime?**

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the deflationary drivers of the last four decades** – 

1.**China** – managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today.

2.**Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe.

3.**Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China.

4.**Female Labor Force Participation** – increased participation of women in the labor force, especially in China.

5.**Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down.

6.**Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model whilst increasing revenues. It also led to increased competition and the emergence of massively disruptive startups.

7.**Technology** – the ultimate deflationary driver which made the world smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, boosted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially.

**Now let us understand which of the above deflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** – 

1.**China** – demography is getting older and wealthier. Cheap labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are already moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh, as China isn’t feasible for cheap labor anymore.

2.**Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity. Reshoring of jobs and supply chains will be inflationary.

3.**Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have mandates in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.

4.**Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the electorate, leading to more fiscal policy solutions, which makes the economy inflationary.

**Apart from the drivers listed above which can turn from deflationary to inflationary, a new set of inflationary drivers can also be witnessed.**

**The new drivers of an Inflationary Regime**

1.**ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock for existing sources of energy as enough new investments weren’t being made. This leads to higher prices for existing sources of energy. New ESG projects require mega capex. Without public investment in ESG, private investment would not be enough to scale or bring down the costs to the end consumer. This either means that private investment bears the loss, increase prices, or the governments subsidize the private investment to bring down the costs to the end user. If private investments have to bear a loss, then investing in ESG wouldn’t be attractive to them, if ESG projects have to increase prices to be profitable, then they may not be feasible to consumers, and if the governments introduce subsidies for private ESG investments, then they would exacerbate the debt problem.

2.**Inequality** – the deflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation.

3.**Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy along with monetary policy is proven to be inflationary.

**But because I have a view on an inflationary regime that doesn’t mean it will actually play out. There are still factors that would be a risk to an inflationary regime and lead to the deflationary regime from the last 4 decades to continue for another few decades.**

**The risks to the drivers of an Inflationary Regime**

1. **Technology** – it could continue to be a deflationary driver and would be enough to replace the labor force exiting the market. These technologies could be AI, robotics, 3D printing, etc.

2. **India & Africa** – although they lack the administrative infrastructure present in China to develop a similar market scale, they could still be a new source for cheap labor.

3. **Female Labor Force Participation** – in countries such as India where the female labor force participation is low, an increase in the participation rate can be a deflationary driver.

4. **Weakening JPY** – the continued weakening of the JPY against the USD can make Japan more competitive in the export market, making it a serious competitor to China. However, to stay relevant, China will be forced to devalue its currency, exporting deflation to the world in the process. Although, the BoJ can stop the JPY from weakening further, but that would mean giving up the YCC, which seems difficult as of now because that would lead to a lot of their domestic institutions and funds failing as they own a lot of the JGB’s. Apart from that, increasing yields in Japan would mean lesser liquidity in the global markets, which could possibly lead to higher yields worldwide. Considering these risks, it seems more likely that Japan would let the JPY weaken as per market forces, which in turn would force the hand of China.

5. **Underestimating China** \- having a tight grip over the country, establishing policies and new laws to make sure prices stay low, won’t be difficult for China. Apart from that, the costs involved in building new supply chains and infrastructure to move away from China, may prove difficult to the world, considering this would require new investments, which would mean a higher debt burden than already exists.

  

**A few other thoughts on the Future Economic Landscape**

1. Governments would be more focused on spending to reduce inequality rather than investing in alternative energy because fiscal stimulus would win votes as that’s money directly in the hands of people.

2. Monetary policy alone would be frowned upon by the electorate and hence fiscal policy would also be required. Monetary and fiscal policy together, are known to be inflationary.

3. PE, VC, and other alternative investments can become risky as liquidity moves out. Liquidity is moving out because treasury yields worldwide are rising and institutional investors who moved to alternative assets in search of yields, are moving out. Treasury yields move higher when inflation moves higher. Not to forget that if JPY keeps going higher, the BoJ will have to give up on the YCC, thus increasing JGB yields, and taking away liquidity from international markets, which in turn can hurt alternative investments all the more. Alternative investments already are under pressure because of lower valuations due to higher interest rates or discount rates, and taking away liquidity means difficulty in finding buyers for existing investors or lower exit valuations. Keeping this in mind, investors should be more stringent with investments in startups or loss making entities.

44,"The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?",16,13yhq75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yhq75/the_future_picks_and_shovels_of_ai_may_not_be/,3,1685724118.0,"For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now. 

I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.

Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.  

Years ago, a paper titled ""Attention is all you need"" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.  

Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy. 

Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs."

#[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
> Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
> Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
> The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
> The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
> However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool.
*****
> He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
> “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.
*****
> The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they’re relaying to the public.
*****
> “No matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‘communicate’ what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,” Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
> “When markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

46,"Considering Google as a potential long-term investment, would love to hear your thoughts",13,141s9z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/141s9z8/considering_google_as_a_potential_longterm/,43,1686000069.0,"Hi r/stocks !

I currently put about 80% of my saving each month (About 4100 USD) to S&P500 (VOO) and the last 20% are divided between multiple technology stocks, mostly Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and AMD (very original, I know). Recently I thought of dividing the last 20% differently and giving 10-15% to 1 company that I believe in instead of dividing it between them ""randomly"" as I did until now, and I thought of Google for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

\* AI - I use AI technologies and ChatGPT daily. I think that while Google are currently behind, they will eventually catch up and be a leader in the sector. They show impressive advancements recently, and not only that there are signs that they are leading the sector in other areas, like physical robots (Like the awesome video where they play soccer/football). On the other hand, Microsoft bought their usage of AI and rely almost entirely on OpenAI to advance the field for them, which is risky and might lead to many issues in the long run.

\* Quantum computing - This market is clearly going to change the world when it becomes mainstream, and Google is currently a leader in the area. They continue developing and researching in the field and continue to show progress, including this year.A combination of advancing in AI in the shorter term and being a strong company in quantum computing in the long run leads me to believe that Google might be a good investment for the long run, possibly more than other technology companies.

Of course I am 100% aware that no one can perdict he future and don't intend to put everything in one basket, but I still wonder what your thoughts are, and if I should put more into Google than other tech companies."
47,NVIDIA's Impressive Report: Not the Market's Silver Bullet,11,13rjtn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rjtn7/nvidias_impressive_report_not_the_markets_silver/,6,1685026250.0,"What's driving today's markets?

As anticipated, Wall Street's opening was a mixed bag, echoing the fluctuating futures. Shares in the real sector and banks are down, whereas technology and semiconductor manufacturers' stocks are enjoying a healthy boost. The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.

What's happening with NVIDIA?

Despite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.

In my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.

However, **I believe this growth alone won't suffice to propel the market further**. Given the challenging economic conditions, I see a high probability of a market correction on the horizon.

Let's also consider some statistical data. U.S. GDP figures surpassed expectations, yet with the unresolved debt ceiling issue, this news has taken a back seat and will likely resonate later. And as for the initial U.S. jobless claims? No change there either, meaning there’s yet more to keep an eye on in the future.

What raises concern is that the **DXY is standing at 104.21 points**, and the **ten-year UST yield is at 3.77% per annum**, with **the two-year yield at an alarming 4.42%**! Meanwhile, **gold is trending downwards**. All in all, quite an intriguing scenario."

# [Stock futures rise slightly as investors await Fed rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed by 45 points, or 0.13%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.22% and 0.24%, respectively.
*****
> Ford Motor beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines in its latest quarter, as did coffee chain Starbucks. However, both stocks declined in the premarket.
*****
> The Fed is scheduled to release its latest policy announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Chair Jerome Powell is also set to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.
*****
> Data from the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders are pricing in an 86% chance the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points. Wall Street will also look for clues on whether the central bank will continue its rate hiking campaign, or if it will pause increases.
*****
> The announcement will come after a rough session for the market. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Ongoing concerns of contagion in the regional banking sector weighed on markets following the First Republic Bank’s collapse and subsequent takeover by JPMorgan.
*****
> “There’s still pain throughout the sector,” iCapital’s Anastasia Amoroso said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “And the reason why I think the bank action should really matter to the Fed is because, remember, in the last FOMC meeting, Fed Chair Powell really gave us new metrics to watch in terms of whether they’re going to be raising rates or not. And that is the extent of the credit tightening that’s happening in the economy.”
*****
> Corporate earnings season continues with CVS Health, Yum Brands and Spirit AeroSystems reporting results Wednesday before the open.
*****
> On the economic front, traders are anticipating the latest ADP jobs data for April. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 133,000 jobs last month.
*****
> The S&P Global U.S. Services PMI data for April is also due. It’s expected to show a reading at 53.7 last month, which is in line with the prior month. April’s ISM non-manufacturing PMI data is forecasted to show 51.8, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That’s higher than the 51.2 reading from the previous month.

# [Dow futures are flat after failed First Republic is sold to JPMorgan: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/30/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-notches-best-month-since-january.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline Monday after the major averages logged gains for April, and traders assessed the takeover of failed bank First Republic.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow climbed 21 points, or 0.06%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.
*****
> The moves come after news that JPMorgan Chase has acquired all of troubled lender First Republic’s deposits and a “substantial majority of assets,” according to a release. JPMorgan’s shares rose 3% in premarket trading on the news.
*****
> “This takes away the uncertainty for the market,” Sarat Sethi, managing partner at DCLA, told CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange” on Monday. “What you’ve seen now is an agreement where depositors will be taken over, and you’ve got some type of guarantee there. That’s important for the market because, you don’t want to see this kind of thing unravel.”
*****
> First Republic reported last week that deposits tumbled more than 40% in the first quarter, triggering further declines in the already struggling stock. Shares have cratered 97% since the start of the year.
*****
> The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rose about half a percent in the premarket, as investors bet the crisis that ignited in March had been contained.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a winning week and month. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow added 272 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% as Big Tech earnings took center stage.
*****
> For the month, the Dow gained 2.5% to notch its best monthly stretch since January, while the benchmark index gained 1.5%. The tech-heavy index posted marginal gains. Earnings reports from major tech companies dominated much of last week’s market debate, fueling the narrative that earnings are faring better-than-feared, despite many widespread macroeconomic concerns.
*****
> So far, a little over half of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with more than 79% and about 72% surpassing earnings and sales expectations, respectively. First-quarter earnings are currently on track to fall 3.7% for the period, a smaller drop than the 6.7% decline projected on March 31, according to FactSet.
*****
> “There was definitely a very positive surprise on the big tech earnings,” said Jan Szilagyi, CEO of Toggle AI. “There was a certain trepidation going into the earnings season,” as expectations called for relative weakness.
*****
> Monday kicks off another busy week for earnings, with results from Norwegian Cruise Line and MGM Resorts. Reports from Pfizer, Starbucks, Advanced Micro Devices and CVS Health are due out later in the week.
*****
> Reports from many of these technology giants helped to lift some market confidence, he added.
*****
> In other news, investors anxiously await the latest rate hike decision from the Federal Reserve, due out Wednesday at the conclusion of the central bank’s policy meeting. As of Monday morning, about 89% of traders anticipate a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Wall Street will closely monitor remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, offering clues into the central bank’s forward policy path.
*****
> Wall Street also awaits ISM manufacturing data, construction spending and S&P Global manufacturing PMI on Monday. April’s nonfarm payrolls report is on deck Friday.

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
> The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
> Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
> One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

China's Baidu Inc beat revenue estimates for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in its advertising, cloud and artificial intelligence businesses.

The search engine giant, which generates most of its revenue from online ads, is seeing advertisers return after China lifted its zero-COVID policies last year in a boost to the country's economic prospects.

The company also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $5 billion.

Quarterly revenue came in at 33.08 billion yuan ($4.80 billion), inching past analysts' estimates of 32.01 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue from Baidu Core, which includes search-based ad sales, cloud offerings and its autonomous driving initiatives, fell 1% to 25.7 billion yuan.

Baidu's research and development expenses were 21.4 billion yuan, accounting for 22.4% of revenue, as it plans to integrate its ChatGPT-like Ernie Bot into cloud, smart cars and household appliances, among other mainstream businesses.

The AI-driven chatbot, seen by many as China's most promising answer to the platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp, will complete internal testing in March.

""The Chinese AI market is on the verge of experiencing an explosive growth in demand, releasing unprecedented and exponential commercial value. Baidu stands as the best example of the long-term growth of China's AI market and is advancing at the forefront of this new wave,"" Baidu CEO Robin Li said.

Li added that the developers of Ernie Bot were sparing no effort to ensure the chatbot was made available as early as possible."

# [Stock futures rise Thursday after S&P 500 posts 4-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/22/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Thursday as traders weigh earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and assess future potential Federal Reserve moves.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%.
*****
> Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue.
*****
> The S&P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain.
*****
> The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes.
*****
> Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target and the labor market “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,” according to the minutes.
*****
> “The Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn’t get entrenched at its current high level,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “By mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.”
*****
> More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John’s, Wayfair and Bath & Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others.

*****
> U.S. stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street hoped that the debt ceiling crisis would soon see a resolution.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 15 points. Futures linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 were also up slightly.
*****
> Regional banks were set to build on their strong gains from the previous session. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) traded 1.3% higher after rising more than 7% on Wednesday. Shares of PacWest popped nearly 6%.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the major averages jumping more than 1% each on Wednesday, as hope for a possible debt ceiling deal grew.
*****
> House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday that he does not believe the U.S. will default on its debt. President Joe Biden also stated in later remarks that he was confident lawmakers would come together to reach a deal and avoid a default.
*****
> Meanwhile, Wells Fargo’s head of equity strategy Chris Harvey was skeptical that progress has been made in Washington on the debt ceiling talks.
*****
> “We still think that macro is going to start to weigh over things. We think people are getting too excited about the debt ceiling in the short term. And we think that there’s probably some more downside as we go forward in time,” Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “We think it’s going to get a little bit more tenuous as we go forward in time,” he continued. “We do think a deal [will] get done, but we think it’s too optimistic at this point in time.”
*****
> Investors will be looking toward retail giant Walmart’s earnings report Thursday for insights on the health of the consumer. China-based tech giant Alibaba is also set to report earnings before the bell.
*****
> Wall Street will also watch out for the weekly jobless claims numbers to gauge the strength of the labor market. The Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing survey numbers for May, as well as existing home sales data for April, are also slated to be released Thursday morning.

We think about Nvidia as a hardware player.

It's fine to invest in these companies, because if AI takes off huge, they'll all reap tremendous rewards, but what about the companies that will use these new AI tools to eliminate huge swaths of their payroll? I think we should concentrate on companies that can continue to do everything that their business model is aligned to do, just with 70 percent less human employees. The gigantic cost savings will start showing up in their surprising earnings beats, and the valuations for these companies will start to accelerate. 

So, which industry uses thousands of human workers to process forms and documents, that won't need any of these workers anymore once AI has completely automated their process? The first industry that popped into my mind is Insurance. Should we look for insurance companies with the largest number of current workers likely to be phased out?

Look, I know this is depressing, but what else are we going to do? If we're all going to have our jobs replaced, might as well get rich investing in these companies on the way out. I don't want to come across as a vulture that's just following a group of travelers in the Sahara desert, just waiting for them to drop dead so they can feast, but it is.... what it is."

*****
> The S&P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
*****
> Stocks slipped on Friday as Wall Street closed out a huge week in which investors received a pause on rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, plus encouraging inflation data.
*****
> The S&P 500 ticked down 0.37% to close at 4,409.59, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 108.94 points, or 0.32%, to close at 34,299.12. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.68% to finish the session at 13,689.57.
*****
> Here are the major market milestones on the week:
> * The S&P 500 is up 2.6% on the week, its best performance since March.
> * It’s the S&P 500′s fifth positive week in a row, the first such streak since November 2021.
> * The benchmark is now up more than 26% from its bear market low.
> * The Nasdaq Composite is up about 3.3% on the week, its best week since March.
> * The Nasdaq is up eight weeks in a row, its best winning streak since 2019.
> * Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up six days in a row through Thursday.
> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 1.3% for the week, its third positive week in a row.
> * The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit their highest levels since April 2022.
*****
> The Federal Reserve delivered what investors wanted this week when the central bank left rates unchanged Wednesday after 10 consecutive hikes. While the Fed signaled that two more rate increases were coming this year, many traders and economists on Wall Street believe the Fed could be nearly done. Earlier in the week, the May consumer price index came in at the lowest in two years.
*****
> Adobe added 0.9% after beating results and issuing upbeat guidance, the latest tech stock to rally. AI darling Nvidia gained 10% this week, adding to its 192% surge this year. Microsoft added 4.7% this week and hit a record Thursday. Tech shares were the hardest hit initially when the Fed embarked on its rate-hiking campaign.
*****
> “Wall Street remains upbeat that the AI wave won’t be going away anytime soon and that investors will prefer US stocks as we see diverging central bank policies worldwide,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “This stock market rally seems a bit overextended but too much money remains on the sidelines, which means if the AI trade remains intact, this winning streak for the S&P 500 can continue.”
*****
> Friday brought more good news on the inflation and economic front. Consumer inflation expectations fell in June, with one-year assumptions for price pressures declining to 3.3% from 4.2% in May. The headline reading from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers came in at 63.9, higher than estimates of 60.2 from Dow Jones.
*****
> Friday’s session saw choppy moves across the stock market as stock options, index futures and index future option contracts.
*****
> Friday also marks the final trading day before a long weekend, with the market closed Monday in observation of Juneteenth.

> # Four Things the Bulls Need to Know

> “The stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming.” -Old stock market axiom

> Here are four things that have caught my attention over the past week.

> First up, you might have heard by now, but the S&P 500 moved into a new bull market, up more than 20% from the October ’22 lows. We wrote about this in detail here, but investors need to know that a year after this happened, the S&P 500 was historically up 17.7% on average and higher 12 out of 13 times.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-3-800x381.png))**

> Adding to the fun, S&P 500 finally made a new 52-week high this week, the first one since early January 2022. What does this mean? Below we looked at all the times stocks went at least one year without a new 52-week high and the good news is more strength is quite likely. A year later stocks have been higher an incredible 15 out of 15 times and up more than 17% on average. Adding that to the numbers in the first table and the next year could continue to surprise to the upside.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-3-800x477.png))**

> Next up, this week marked officially eight months since the bear market ended. To think stocks would be up more than 20% by now would have been crazy to most investors if they were being honest. The quote I used above is one I always think about when stocks fall and it really does sum up investor sentiment well. Very few were saying ‘buy stocks’ last October and most didn’t say it early in 2023 either.

> We did note the week of the lows why the lows were likely in (and boy did the bears hate that call), but even I’ve got to admit the strength this year has been impressive. We moved to overweight equities in our Carson House View models in mid-December and we added to equity risk in late March during the regional bank crisis. To sum it up, we’ve been in the lonely bullish camp and continue to think higher prices are coming.

> What does eight months without a new 52-week low mean? It would be extremely rare for stocks to roll over and make new lows from here for starters. Also, three months later the S&P 500 was up 85% of the time, six months later 90% of the time, and a year later 80% of the time higher. The bottom line, once you get to eight months without a new 52-week low, the upward trajectory likely stays in place.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-1-800x277.png))**

> Lastly, the bear market officially started a year ago this week, as the S&P 500 moved to down 20% from the January ’22 peak on 6/13/2022. That wasn’t a fun time for investors at all, but here we are a year later, and stocks are up more than 16%. In other words, had you had the intestinal fortitude to buy when all the headlines were negative, you’d be sitting on some great gains a year later. Again, think about the quote at the top of this blog. This is what is important to always remember. Stocks go up and they go down. If you want to get some good deals, you need to buy when they are lower.

> # Why the Fed Wasn’t As Hawkish As Everyone Thinks

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) didn’t raise rates in June, leaving the Federal Funds rate in the 5-5.25% range. This was the first meeting in which they held back ever since they started raising rates back in March 2022.

> However, the big news was that Fed members project rates to be 0.5%-points higher than what they projected back in March. Members updated their projections for rates to hit 5.6% at the end of 2023, up from the previous estimate of 5.1%. By itself, this was viewed as a very hawkish signal, despite the pause in rate hikes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Fed-rate-projections-600x800.png))**

> If you recall, the last set of projections was made in March soon after the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. At the time, they said that potential credit tightening would be equivalent to rate hikes, so they left projections unchanged.

> Fast forward three months and the economy looks to have weathered the banking crisis, even as core inflation (excluding food and energy) remains elevated. Hence the update to where they believe rates should be at the end of 2023.

> However, the rest of the materials they released, along with Fed Chair Powell’s comments suggest more rate hikes are not a certainty.

> **The Fed is (finally) acknowledging the economy’s resilience**

> Along with interest rate projections, Fed members also updated their economic projections. This is where things got interesting. The updated projections included:

> * Raising 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%
>  * Dropping the 2023 unemployment rate from 4.5% to 4.1%

> Despite projecting more rate hikes, they seem to believe that economic growth will be stronger than they expected back in March, and the unemployment rate lower.

> At the same time, they also expect inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index (their preferred measure) to be 3.9% y the end of 2023. In March, the expectation was 3.6%. The higher projection makes sense within the context of the economic strength we’re seeing currently (we’ve written about this).

> Moreover, Fed members expect core inflation to slow to 2.6% in 2024, leading them to project interest rate cuts worth about 1%. Even as the economy grows 1.1% in 2024.

> Take all these projections with several grains of salt. Moreover, these projections are not forecasts – instead, they’re more like best guesses.

> However, it is a sign that Fed officials finally believe that inflation can slow down without a recession. That’s a significant turnaround from what they’ve been signaling over the last year, i.e. a huge economic slowdown/recession is necessary for inflation to fall.

> In fact, Powell acknowledged that the conditions are in place for inflation to slow down – economic growth has fallen below trend though activity remains strong, the labor market is less tight, and goods supply chain disruptions are easing.

> Pausing in June allows them to get more information about the impact of rate hikes and the banking crisis. Now, the July Fed meeting is only 6 weeks away and there’s not enough data that will give them that information. Instead, they’re looking for at least 3 months of data to see how things evolve.

> That buys time and indicates that 2 more rate hikes (each worth 0.25%) are not a sure thing. At the same time, raising the 2023 estimate ensures that investors believe they are serious about curbing inflation, and gives them the optionality to increase rates if inflation remains persistent.

> **Good news: inflation looks to be headed lower**

> Headline CPI inflation has decelerated from a peak of 9.1% year-over-year in June 2022 to 4% in May. Over the past three months, inflation is running at a 2.2% annualized pace, the slowest 3-month pace since two and half years.

> The big driver of the pullback has been energy, but more recently, food prices have also started falling. Vehicle prices, which boosted inflation last year, are also moving lower – used car prices rose over the last two months, but private data indicates that it’s going to reverse soon.

> What’s left? As the chart below indicates, a lot of it is shelter inflation (the dark green bar). This is the main reason why core inflation remains elevated, running at a 5% annualized pace over the last three months. That’s simply too high for the Fed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-HEadline-inflation-breakdown-662x800.png))**

> The good news is that shelter inflation looks to be at an inflection point. We’ve discussed in the past how the official rental inflation data has a significant lag to the private market data. Private data have been showing rents to be decelerating for more than a year now. It’s taken a while, but the official data is now turning around as well. It is a bit like turning an aircraft carrier around, and so it is going to take a while. But it is just a matter of time before core inflation decelerates on the back of falling shelter inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-rental-inflation-private-vs-official-598x800.png))**

> Now, the Fed has said that they need to see even services inflation excluding shelter decelerate. We received good news on that front. The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter. It measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently. Over the past 3 months, this measure is running at a 2.5% annualized pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Sticky-CPI-615x800.png))**

> On top of this, the producer price index, which measures input prices for businesses and typically leads inflation, has collapsed to just 1.2% year-over-year in May. That’s well off the peak pace of 11.6% we saw in March 2022, and lower than the pre-pandemic average of 2%. Even excluding food and energy, PPI is down to 2.8% now from 9.7% 14 months ago.

> All in all, there’s encouraging news on the inflation front even as the economy remains resilient. Powell’s comments reflect that. This is why we’re not quite so convinced that two more rate hikes are baked in. But expect them to leave rates higher for longer.

> # Why Strong Stock Returns on Friday is Bullish

> One of the most hated and despised rallies continued last week, with the S&P now up nearly 12% on the year and officially up more than 20% from the October lows. If you’ve been reading or listening to what the Carson Investment Research team has been saying, then you know we’ve been in the camp we’ve been in a new bull market for quite some time now, expecting continued higher prices. None the less, with stocks now officially up 20%, we see others finally coming around. For instance, check out the cover of Barron’s over the weekend. Yeah, we sure weren’t seeing things like that in January, were we?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Slide1-1-800x450.png))**

> Sonu and I both wrote blogs last week on stocks being up 20% from the lows and you can read them here and here. Additionally, here’s a Yahoo! Finance hit I did on October 13, the exact day that stocks officially bottomed. I noted many reasons to think better times were coming and fortunately, that is exactly what has happened.

> Additionally, here’s the blog I wrote a week after the October lows titled Why Stocks Likely Just Bottomed. Our bullish tilt since late last year wasn’t popular and has been widely mocked by many bears for months and months. We aren’t hearing so much chirping from them now though

> One thing we’ve notice lately is buying and strength in stocks later in the week, specifically on Thursday and Friday. We love to see this, as it shows there is confidence to hold stocks over the weekend. Those of us that have done this long enough remember how volatile (and usually bearish) Friday afternoons would be during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) or during the COVID bear market in February and March of 2020. Even last year during the bear market we saw historically weak returns on Friday.

> So, to now see buying and confidence on Thursday and Friday in ’23 are significant changes from what we saw during previous bearish phases and could be another clue that this bull market is indeed healthy and likely has legs left.

> This first chart shows just how much better Thursday and Friday are doing than the other days this year. Again, we like to see this late week buying as a clue things are healthy and confident. (For those wondering how we did the annualized return calculations, the average Friday return this year so far has been a gain of 0.40%, so we multiplied that by 252 (the number of trading days per year) to get an annualized return).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pic3-800x450.png))**

> Let’s talk specifically about Friday, shall we? As of last week, Friday was up an incredible 101.7% on an annualized basis in ’23. This would come in as the best Friday EVER. Now, let’s be honest, the odds do favor this coming back to earth some over the remaining rest of the year, but overall we are on a great start to this year being one of the best ever for stocks on a Friday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pic2_Edited-800x450.png))**

> What does it all mean you ask? In the final table below, I looked at all years that had at least a 55% annualized return on Friday. This was the very best 12 years ever for Friday returns and sure enough, they are also some of the best years overall for stocks. In other words, some of the best years ever also saw strong performance on the last day of the week, further confirming that buying on a Friday is what you tend to see in bullish markets.

> We will end on this note, stocks were higher 12 out of 12 times in these years and up a very impressive 24.8% on average, about half of this year’s 12.0% return so far. This could be a subtle clue that as good as this year has been, it could have more in the tank before all is said and done. I did discuss this Friday concept on Yahoo! Finance on Friday.

> # Solid Pre-Election June Gains As Expected

> June is delivering much better than typical pre-election year strength, but NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are leading the charge as usual. R2K was up 7% for the month yesterday and NAS was up 4%, both up more today. However, June quarterly OpEx is riddled with volatility. Week after DJIA is Down 27 of the last 33 years 1990-2022. (2023 STA page 108.) S&P down 23 of 33. NASDAQ down 18/33.

> So far in 2023 NASDAQ is closely tracking the pre-election pattern up 28.6% year-to-date! But remember, June ends NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months with a seasonal peak in mid-July. Enjoy this AI/Chip-driven rally for now and use it to reposition for the Worst 4 Months July-October.

> The backdrop is set up for sideways action over the weak summer months, especially after mid-July into the worst two months of the year August and September. This is lining up well for our NASDAQ Best 8 Months MACD Seasonal Sell Signal that can occur anytime on or after June 1. AI (Almanac Investor) subscribers will be emailed when it triggers.

> # More Balanced June

> Heading into the month of June, stock market performance this year was a clear case of the haves and the have-nots. The chart below shows the performance of S&P 500 sectors on a YTD basis through the end of May. As of 5/31, just three sectors - Technology, Communications Services, and Consumer Discretionary - were outperforming the S&P 500 YTD, and the eight other sectors were not only underperforming the S&P 500's YTD gain of 8.9%, but they were also all down on a YTD basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/06/061323-Sectors-YTD.png))**

> The flip of the calendar has seen the trend of uneven YTD returns flip as well. Besides the fact that every sector is up on a MTD basis, the number of sectors outperforming the S&P 500's 4.6% MTD gains are much more evenly split with five sectors outperforming and six underperforming. Surprisingly, one of those sectors lagging behind the S&P 500 is Technology! Uneven market returns have been a key complaint of bears all year. If the pattern of June continues, though, what will they blame next?

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street awaits tech earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/23/stock-futures-inch-down-as-wall-street-awaits-tech-earnings.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell on Monday as investors awaited a slew of corporate earnings from big tech companies, as well as fresh economic data releases.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 89 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major indexes all fell last week as the earnings season began to ramp up, with several prominent banking names posting their quarterly results for the first time since the bank failures in March. The Dow dropped 0.23% and ended a four-week winning streak. The Nasdaq declined 0.42%, while the S&P edged down 0.1%.
*****
> Roughly 76% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Friday beat analyst earnings estimates, according to FactSet data. However, first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are estimated to decline an overall 5.2%, per Refinitiv.
*****
> Wall Street is looking ahead toward mega-cap tech earnings results this week in what will mark the halfway point of earnings season. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are among the high-interest names scheduled to announce their results for the first quarter.
*****
> “A lot of these companies took 2022 as an opportunity to dump all the bad stuff into their earnings,” said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Friday, regarding upcoming tech earnings.
*****
> “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a lot of positive surprises coming out of their earnings reports,” Damodaran added.
*****
> Investors are also keeping a close eye out on new economic data that will provide insight into whether inflation is cooling, or if the Federal Reserve will announce another rate hike at its next meeting in early May. GDP numbers for the first quarter, as well as April’s consumer sentiment data will be released among a flurry of other economic indicators.
*****
> “Part of the reason why we’re so focused on the economic data is we think the investor narrative is still around the Fed and interest rates. And we think the economic reports over the next seven to 10 days are going to be the really big driver of ultimately what the Fed is going to do,” said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments.
*****
> Bassuk continued, “We’re expecting the data, frankly, to be mixed. And we think that’s going to continue to cause uncertainty and continued volatility. I think, to some extent, the Fed rate hike slowed down the economy. But there’s still elements where things are still looking pretty robust. Because of that, we’re thinking that the Fed is likely to do one more rate cut.”
*****
> Coca-Cola and Credit Suisse are set to report earnings Monday before the bell. Whirlpool and First Republic Bank will be announcing their results after Monday’s trading session. Traders will also watch out for the Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing survey results to gauge the state of the state’s factory activity.

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday after the Biden administration and Republican lawmakers reached a tentative deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures gained 0.6%. Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 1.2%.
*****
> President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default over the weekend, with Congress set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday. Lawmakers have not signaled that they intended to return to Capitol Hill early to work on the deal. Both Republican and Democratic support is needed for the bill agreement to pass.
*****
> “Although the upcoming votes in Congress still pose a small risk, the main risk had been that political pressures would prevent a deal from coming together,” wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a note. “Now that a deal has been reached, it seems very likely to pass both chambers of Congress in the coming week.”

*****
> U.S. stock futures were higher Friday as regional banks rebounded and traders tried to end a volatile week on a high note.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 147 points, or 0.44%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.46% and 0.3%, respectively.
*****
> Regional banks rose broadly after declining in the previous session. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1%, with shares of embattled bank PacWest rising 0.9%. Western Alliance advanced 2.2%. On Thursday, regional banks dropped broadly after PacWest said its deposits fell sharply last week.
*****
> Tesla shares rose 1.6% after Elon Musk said Thursday that he’s stepping down as chief executive at Twitter. He will oversee product at the social media firm.
*****
> Investors are also keeping an eye on Washington as concern around debt ceiling negotiations persisted. CNBC reported that a debt ceiling meeting between President Joe Biden and congressional leaders that was set for Friday was postponed to next week.
*****
> Investors are coming off a fourth straight losing session for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Thursday slid more than 200 points, or 0.66%. Disney’s decline a day after it reported poor subscriber numbers weighed on stocks. The S&P 500 declined 0.17%. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.18%.
*****
> Meanwhile, weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data, a sign of easing inflation, failed to shield investors from ongoing concerns of a downturn ahead — particularly as a handful of stocks continue to carry the market.
*****
> “It’s a fairly typical story,” JPMorgan’s Jason Hunter said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You see the thin leadership, and then at some point the growth decelerates enough to cause a true flight to cash.”
*****
> Investors are anticipating preliminary consumer sentiment data on Friday, set to release after the open. Economists polled by the Dow Jones are expecting a May reading of 63.0, which would be lower than the level of 63.5 in the previous reading.
*****
> April import prices are also due out before the open on Friday. Economists are expecting a 0.3% rise last month, compared to the decline of 0.6% the prior month.
*****
> As of Thursday’s close, the Dow and the S&P 500 are headed for their second negative week in a row, down 1.08% and 0.14% this week, respectively. However, the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for its third straight positive week, up 0.76%.

60,"Effects of name rebranding on stock value: MCG (Membership Collective Group) changes to SHCO (Soho House & Co). Can you buy ""cool""? [DD]",4,11xk8g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11xk8g6/effects_of_name_rebranding_on_stock_value_mcg/,5,1679412575.0,"What are your thoughts on the ""rebranding"" name change from Membership Collective Group Inc. (ticker MCG) to Soho House & Co Inc. (SHCO)? Will this change create value or is the change superficial?

Some open questions:

**Will business operations or resource distributions change in a meaningful way?**

MCG first pitched itself as a tech company during their recent IPO in July 2021: ( MCG is “a global membership platform of physical and digital spaces”) and a SoHo House app, but they claim that the name change will be accompanied by a ""return to their roots"" as a members club with a ""member-first focus"".

[https://www.ft.com/content/cbc925e1-0915-404b-b5ef-ca8bb62793df](https://www.ft.com/content/cbc925e1-0915-404b-b5ef-ca8bb62793df)

\-What will happen to their Soho House app?-Will they invest more in the co-working spaces or the members clubs going forward?-How will members react to recent hikes in membership fees (almost doubled to about  £2,750.00 per year for members over 27 years old to access all houses)

[https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/pricing](https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/pricing)

**When does ""brand"" matter to investors in addition to profitability?**

Applicants join SoHo house for it's cool brand name. The claim of being a ""networking space for creatives"" seems overstated. 

But how much do investors care about putting money into stocks that ""sound cool""? Halal investing appeals to investors moral compass, but does ""cool"" investing appeal to institutional or retail investors identity?

The business model started with a strategy to buy failing hotels, and turn them into members clubs. Recently they have adapted their model to increase the types of subscriptions (and the price of subscriptions.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/dealbook/soho-house-ipo.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/dealbook/soho-house-ipo.html)

**Historical effects of name changes on stock price?**

A study of 58 firms across 1981-1985 showed name change did lead to increase in stock price, especially when initial performance was poor (like MCG) and when the firms produced industrial goods (unlike MCG).

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/183841](https://www.jstor.org/stable/183841)

A more recent study during the 2000s internet surge showed that adding ""dot com"" or other internet affiliation to existing companies produced returns of around 74 percent for the 10 days after the announcement. This is similar to why many companies are trying to add AI to their brand and mission in 2023.

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-1082.00408?casa\_token=s-3IkpI38O8AAAAA:mOh62hGRG35lMtaeJQICmHUCsb0aHUw\_0tvdIj-QULr6zLjMMU9MP0K1UnZrAnYDh59p7cEFJvF7i\_MeTA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0022-1082.00408?casa_token=s-3IkpI38O8AAAAA:mOh62hGRG35lMtaeJQICmHUCsb0aHUw_0tvdIj-QULr6zLjMMU9MP0K1UnZrAnYDh59p7cEFJvF7i_MeTA)

&#x200B;

**Will they be profitable in the long run?**

The 2021 MCG IPO price was $14, and has steadily declined to the current price around $6.50.

The lingering question is can a company who relies on exclusivity (making it hard to gain membership) scale after going public? Do private membership clubs appeal to a large enough segment of people with disposable income?

Raising membership prices during a recession is a risky choice, but it seems to be paying of in the short term.

61,AI Investment Play Due to API/Plugin Integration of GPT,5,12464pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12464pz/ai_investment_play_due_to_apiplugin_integration/,8,1679962363.0,"So basically, last week's big news was the announcement on availability of plugins/APIs for ChatGPT.

[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins)

This will allow users to use the GPT prompts to interface with other third-party apps (e.g. Expedia, Shop, Slack) and facilitate transactions.  I think this is a big step towards changing the way we interface with other websites when it comes to shopping, ordering food, communicating with others, etc.  That being said, most likely, not all of these apps will benefit from the interface as at the end of the day, the user traffic needs to increase significantly due to the technology.  In other words, I am not sure if more people will be using Expedia now that they can connect through GPT given that Expedia hinges on the number of people willing to go on a vacation/trips.  And facilitating this move will not make it such that more people will go on vacations/trips than ever before.  So I think.

So in picking AI related stocks, I think one needs to take this information into account and be creative about what kind of companies will get a significant increase in traffic/users due to the connection with GPT.  In general, it seems like there needs to be some sort of barrier that dissuades many customers from currently using the app and GPT breaking down this barrier.  So I am thinking something to do with creative work (e.g. game development, art creation, music creation) can be a solid play here.  For example, if ChatGPT and its integration makes it easier for anyone to create pretty good looking and entertaining games, it is conceivable that the number of users for a platform like Unity might increase dramatically.

Any thoughts on this matter?  Any comment on whether this line of reasoning seems reasonable and if it does, specific stocks that can benefit from explosion of users can be beneficial in discussion."

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to resume rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock market futures were slightly higher Thursday as investors tried to regain their footing a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-day winning streak and a recent market rally appeared to fade.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow were 39 points higher, or 0.11%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.16% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Dow fell roughly 172 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 declined 0.7% for its first negative session in four. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.25%. The tech-heavy index and S&P 500 are now both on track to snap a four-week winning streak.
*****
> Those moves came as traders parsed through the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting. The central bank remains committed to fighting inflation, but indicated it could adjust its pace of tightening based on market conditions.
*****
> Investors have been hoping that the Fed might slow the pace of its rate hikes after July’s consumer price index reading showed inflation cooling slightly. But not everyone is convinced.
*****
> “We’re in the camp that the Fed is not going to pivot,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The minutes didn’t make us change our mind at all. We think a 75 basis point hike is likely in September, and we’ll see more hikes at the end of the year ... we think the market is a little lofty right here,” he added.
*****
> The latest batch of earnings report didn’t help traders’ sentiment during Wednesday’s session. Target’s quarter missed estimates, with results from Lowe’s coming in mixed.
*****
> Some key economic data will also be released Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and existing home sales.

# [S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures jump after Nvidia’s blockbuster quarter: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 jumped Thursday as investors cheered the latest quarterly results from Nvidia. Meanwhile, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid after Fitch Ratings placed the United States’ AAA rating on a negative rating watch.
*****
> S&P 500 futures were up 0.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures popped 1.9%. Dow futures were down 85 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Nvidia shares surged 27% in the premarket trading after the artificial intelligence beneficiary gave stronger-than-expected revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter, while also reporting beats on the top and bottom line in the previous quarter. Several analysts covering the stock hiked their price targets on the stock following the results.
*****
> Other semiconductor stocks followed Nvidia higher, including AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor, which rose 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 6.2%.
*****
> Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings put the U.S.′ AAA long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on a negative watch. The rating agency said the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations have raised the risks that the government could miss payments on some of its obligations. However, Fitch said it still expects a resolution before the X-date.
*****
> Those moves follow a down day for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday posting a fourth straight day of losses. The 30-stock index dropped 255.59 points, or 0.77%. The S&P 500 ended the day lower by 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.61%.
*****
> Debt ceiling negotiations continued to weigh on the major averages. The talks hit a hurdle earlier Wednesday. Later, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy indicated negotiations were making progress.
*****
> “We play this political game leading up and into the limit,” Atlas Merchant Capital CEO Bob Diamond said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think there’s no question that it would be a terrible, terrible, terrible decision to default for the dollar, for U.S. Treasurys, for our brand and reputation. I think the chances of that happening are extremely light.”
*****
> In corporate earnings, retailers Best Buy, Dollar Tree and Ralph Lauren will report Thursday before the open.
*****
> Traders can expect the second reading on gross domestic product in the first quarter before the open on Thursday, as well as the latest weekly jobless claims data. April pending home sales data is also on deck after the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.8%, up from the decline of 5.2% the prior month.

64,Open Source Automated Sentiment Analysis using Python Polygon.io and Open.ai,3,13o7r8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13o7r8x/open_source_automated_sentiment_analysis_using/,16,1684706531.0,"Greetings r/stocks I hope this post finds you well!

This tool is still in development and requires tuning! At this point I think Chat-gpt 4.0 code interpreter has taken me as far as we can get without expanding the effort with additional minds.

https://github.com/NerdyBurner/SAStocks

This tool is meant to replicate this research from the university of Florida:

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4412788](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4412788)

Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models

Article explaining the research:

[https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chatgpt-trading-algorithm-delivers-500-returns-in-stock-market](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/chatgpt-trading-algorithm-delivers-500-returns-in-stock-market)

ChatGPT Trading Algorithm Delivers 500% Returns in Stock Market

# 

Problem I had to solve:

The university used backend financial data, we as individuals do not have access to that data. Enter polygon.io and their incredible toolkit of financial data!

# 

Why did I build this tool?

I have had extensive conversations with chat-gpt4. One thing is clear, the best use of its abilities is to rapidly democratize its computational ability. Yes the tool likely requires refinement but now its in your hands. If you know python you can reach out to me to discuss refinements. If you are in finance and can help with the algorithms and analysis please also contribute if desired.

Just imagine a million people using AI intelligence to successfully inform their investing. The researchers achieved 500% returns.. if we are even half as successful it will be a huge win for all involved

# 

Targeting with Tickers.csv

I deliberately made this flexible. I'm targeting the S&P 500 but you could target whatever you want in the stock market by editing this list...

# 

How will I use the data?

The database generated by this output will be fed into GPT 4 Code Interpreter. Expect a second post that links back to this one with the data analytics. Right now the model is running - one thing I will say is due to rate limits it takes a while..

# Putting my money where my mouth is:

We determined that the model will benefit from the performance of actual holdings so I am giving $3000 of my ROTH IRA to this process. Positions will be posted tomorrow by close of business.

**Application Functional Summary**

This application is a sentiment analysis tool for stock market news. It uses both the Vader sentiment analysis tool from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the OpenAI API to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to specific stock tickers.

The application pulls API keys from a CSV file named api\_keys.csv where each key is stored as a row. The keys that it uses are for OpenAI and Polygon.io. Stock tickers are obtained from a CSV file named Tickers.csv.

The application saves news articles and sentiment analysis results to SQLite databases, and it also prints a final report with the aggregated sentiment scores for all stock tickers.

**Required or Suggested Programs**

Python 3.6 or higher is required to run this application.

You'll also need several Python libraries, including pandas, nltk, requests, sqlite3, openai, and retrying.

**API keys for the following services:**

OpenAI: You can get an API key by creating an account on the OpenAI website ([https://www.openai.com/](https://www.openai.com/)). The cost is $20 per month plus additional charges based on usage.

Polygon.io: You can get an API key by creating an account on the Polygon.io website ([https://polygon.io/](https://polygon.io/)). The cost is $30 per month.

**Areas for Improvement**

Aggregated Scores Algorithm:

The current algorithm for calculating the aggregated score is quite simple, and it might not accurately reflect the actual sentiment of the news articles. This could be improved by using a more sophisticated sentiment scoring algorithm, perhaps one that takes into account more nuanced aspects of the news articles.

GPT Prompt:

The prompt used for GPT-3 could potentially be improved. Currently, it asks the model to categorize the sentiment of an article as 'Good', 'Bad', or 'Unknown'. This could be expanded to include more nuanced sentiments, or to ask for a more detailed analysis of the article.

Expanding the Inputs to the Sentiment Analysis:

Currently, the application only considers the title and description of each news article for sentiment analysis. This could be expanded to include other elements of the articles, such as the main body text, or even comments on the article if available.

Expand to More Data Sources:

Currently, the application only uses news articles from Polygon.io. It might be beneficial to include more data sources to get a more comprehensive view of the sentiment around each stock ticker.

Error Handling and Logging:

While the application does some error handling, it could be improved by adding more detailed logging, so that if something goes wrong, it's easier to diagnose the problem.

Code Optimization:

Some parts of the code could potentially be optimized for better performance, especially the parts that involve making requests to external APIs or querying the database.

Remember to always keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly."

*****
> Stock futures were flat Monday, with investors preparing for more quarterly earnings reports.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 gained about 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up 58 points, or 0.17%.
*****
> Charles Schwab is set to report earnings later in the day. The stock has been under pressure recently, as traders feared the brokerage may suffer a similar fate to regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. However, the company has defended its financial position, noting last month it has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Schwab shares are down 39% year to date.
*****
> Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are slated to report earnings Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Investors have been eyeing the overall health of the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month spurred a liquidity crisis. Other notable names outside of financials, including electric vehicle heavyweight Tesla will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, while Procter & Gamble reports on Friday.
*****
> Corporate earnings got off to a positive start last week as banking giants Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat expectations. But discouraging retail sales data showed a slowdown in consumer spending by 1% in March pulled markets lower Friday.
*****
> As companies grapple with sticky inflation and higher rates, many investors have braced for a downbeat earnings reports, but data from Bank of America suggests that this earnings reporting season may already be faring better than expected. Of the companies that reported during the first week, 90% topped EPS estimates. That marks the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the Wall Street firm said.
*****
> For the week, however, stocks remained resilient. The Dow was positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both had their fourth week in the green in five.

66,Tesla stock ($TSLA) sinks as Barclays says it's time 'to move to the sidelines'.,2,14fvfiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14fvfiv/tesla_stock_tsla_sinks_as_barclays_says_its_time/,11,1687414916.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) stock sank 5.5% on Wednesday, its steepest loss in two months, after one analyst on Wall Street cautioned it was time to take some money off the table.  
  
In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near-term questions about the stock’s fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn’t exactly trade on fundamentals — it currently trades at a forward P/E of 80 — Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.  
  
“We believe the stock’s recent rally can be best explained by the market’s current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,” Levy said in his note. “Yet while we aren’t surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.”

Levy’s main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla’s recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and, most importantly, how multiple expansion is really the “entirety of the rally.”  
  
As for AI, the recent run-up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company’s ventures like FSD (full self-driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a “long-dated” opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.

Similarly, Tesla’s charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating “marketing benefits” for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long term, Levy says.  
  
The biggest factor for the \~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla’s near-term fundamentals haven’t changed, and while other AI-related stocks have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn’t the case for Tesla.  
  
Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla’s 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla’s margins are still “uncertain” given recent price cuts, though it is possible margins may have troughed. Finally, more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.  
  
All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla’s prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. “We continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,” Levy says, but “near term fundamentals need to be considered.”"
67,"Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock",0,13us12c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13us12c/powerhouse_picks_meta_amzn_or_nflx_unveiling_the/,9,1685359157.0," 

# Meta Platforms ($META)

Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.

Investors have also cheered the company’s aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta’s prospects.

Meta’s user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps –Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.

**Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company’s AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta’s positioning within the digital ads space.

## Amazon ($AMZN)

Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company’s retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS’s growth.

Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN’s rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon’s ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.

**Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**

Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company’s AI market position “diminish.”

Recent channel checks by Lee’s firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS’s generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.

“Case studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,” said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.

## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.

Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix’s business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.

**What is the Price Target for Netflix?**

On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.

Prior to the announcement, the analyst’s firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for “remote” users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.

While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for “remote” users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.

# Conclusion

Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels.

(BIDU) is planning to roll out an artificial intelligence chatbot service similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to a person familiar with the matter, potentially China’s most prominent entry in a race touched off by the tech phenomenon. 

China’s largest search engine company plans to debut a ChatGPT-style application in March, initially embedding it into its main search services, said the person, asking to remain unidentified discussing private information. The tool, whose name hasn’t been decided, will allow users to get conversation-style search results much like OpenAI’s popular platform.

The company’s shares rose as much as 5.8% after Bloomberg’s report, the largest intraday gain in almost four weeks. 

Baidu has spent billions of dollars researching AI in a years-long effort to transition from online marketing to deeper technology. Its Ernie system — a large-scale machine-learning model that’s been trained on data over several years — will be the foundation of its upcoming ChatGPT-like tool, the person said. A Baidu representative declined to comment.

69,IonQ Pursues a Revolutionary Step in AI: Striving to Develop Quantum Machine Learning Models Matching Human Cognitive Abilities,0,13z5osk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13z5osk/ionq_pursues_a_revolutionary_step_in_ai_striving/,16,1685780136.0,"  
IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  
In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.  
Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).

70,What's up with Microsoft's poor execution?,0,1146ap4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1146ap4/whats_up_with_microsofts_poor_execution/,53,1676595051.0,"Microsoft (MSFT) recently invested a lot of money into openai which is a good product but lacks monetisation and is seemingly unprofitable as most of the value it provides doesn't go back to the company hosting the AI, ChatGPT. 

Then, when they integrated ChatGPT into bing it still suffered from mistakes and issues like Microsoft's old AI such as ""going crazy"". Not to mention it's inaccessible to most of the public why launch it at all. After ""making Google dance"" they made the same mistakes.

This has been a problem with Microsoft with gaming as well. They buy large companies and IPs but can't produce good games. 

One example is Halo: Infinite where a combination of bad leads, contracting mistakes and dropping the ball on marketing led to a product that many enjoyed but still not good enough to set records despite being a record setting game for its budget. This led to it leaving a lot of money on the table. 

I just don't get why Microsoft can't seem to get it's shit together they could be so much more valuable as a company if they were able to execute. Don't get me wrong it's been performing well and even growing and I even own the stock this isn't a knock on Microsoft I just think it could be better."

In 1975, Kodak invented the digital camera. Kodak was scared that the digital camera would kill its business and so management shelved it hoping it would be a passing fad. Here comes Google's cannibalization problem. If Google releases and focuses on developing Bard, what happens to its search engine business (cash cow)? These challenges give rise to the innovator's dilemma. OpenAI has nothing to lose (at first it was a non-profit) but has a lot to gain. Hence its massive sprint. What next for Alphabet's stock? AI (and ChatGPT) have taken the world by storm."
