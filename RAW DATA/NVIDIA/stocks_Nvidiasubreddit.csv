0,Pelosi's husband buying over $1 million of computer chip stock ahead of vote,5794,w2x1ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2x1ts/pelosis_husband_buying_over_1_million_of_computer/,460,1658248545.0,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/cnn-msnbc-abc-cbs-nbc-ignore-pelosis-husband-buying-over-dollar1-million-of-computer-chip-stock-ahead-of-vote/ar-AAZKFKr?li=BBnb7Kz)

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. 

 Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

 Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. 

""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids."" "
1,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,3181,12zeetm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12zeetm/britain_blocks_microsofts_69_billion_acquisition/,598,1682508059.0,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

2,Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,2354,13rxgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rxgz6/cathie_woods_ark_invest_sold_most_of_its_nvidia/,405,1685058945.0,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

3,"EU approves Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle",2232,13ia8cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ia8cg/eu_approves_microsofts_69_billion_acquisition_of/,312,1684161583.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes."

5,Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,1428,13vr1zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13vr1zd/nvidia_hits_1_trillion_market_cap/,468,1685455008.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest."

""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Nvidia released its preliminary earnings on Aug. 8, warnings investors that the company was going to miss on its own expectations for the quarter as gaming sales continued to plummet.

9,Intel to invest $4.6 billion in new chip plant in Poland,1062,14avon6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14avon6/intel_to_invest_46_billion_in_new_chip_plant_in/,261,1686918820.0,"Intel plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in a new semiconductor assembly and test facility near Wrocław, Poland, as part of a multi-billion-dollar investment drive across Europe to build chip capacity, it said on Friday.

The U.S. chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany along with facilities in Ireland and France as it seeks to benefit from European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.

The facility in Poland will employ 2,000 workers and create several thousand additional jobs during the construction phase and hiring by suppliers, the company said in a statement.

""Poland was just a little bit hungrier to win this site,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a news conference.

Several countries have been vying to get Intel to invest in their regions and some, like Germany, who have secured a commitment from Intel, have been in talks on the amount of subsidies they can doll out.

Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday that the German government and Intel were close to an agreement for 9.9 billion euros ($10.83 billion) in subsidies, up from a previously agreed 6.8 billion.

""We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for competitiveness,"" Gelsinger said in an interview.

""Labour costs have gone up substantially, material costs have gone up substantially, so all of a sudden, the cost gap was bigger than we had originally estimated.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with Gelsinger on Monday, a government spokesperson said in Berlin.

Gelsinger declined to provide detail on the subsidy amount, but said he hopes to come to an agreement.

""The gaps are too big. If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward,"" Gelsinger said.

The level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.

Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.

Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory ""the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland"".

The company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.

It expects the facility to come online by 2027.

Intel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.

The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.  
  
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".  
  
Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).  
  
The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.  
  
Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.  
  
The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.  
  
Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.

It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.  
  
Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.  
  
""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias. 

Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), ""a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors.""

Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.

 It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing! 

**Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!"
14,Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports,923,xc17d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xc17d8/biden_to_hit_china_with_broader_curbs_on_us_chip/,207,1662950594.0,"The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said. The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

15,Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,907,13wi9do,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13wi9do/cathie_wood_calls_nvidia_stock_overpriced_after/,372,1685528570.0,"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).  
  
The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.  


Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.  
  
  
Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  
It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  
With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  
""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted.  
There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  
Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  
""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote.  
With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.

  
Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  
But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  
The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%."

Can’t we agree 2000 was a totally different time than 2022? It has been over 20 years since the crash but fear mongering is still there. 

Today, 60% of QQQ consists of companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Costco and more such. Are these companies similar to what we had in 2000? I don’t think so. Also how would I l know, I was 5 at that time.

A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker’s shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock’s recent surge.  
  
Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday. He pocketed $48.3 million through the transaction, which took place with shares that he held in his living trust.

Jones, who is also the managing partner of private-investment entity Square Wave Ventures, holds 676,396 shares of Nvidia through the trust after Tuesday’s activity. He owns another 137,934 shares directly.  


The latest transaction by Jones follows a move by the Nvidia director to unload 70,205 shares at an average price of $405 on June 2, according to a filing from earlier in the month. He made over $28 million through that earlier burst of selling.  
  
Jones is reducing his Nvidia holdings as the stock has seen a massive run up so far this year, rising nearly 200% over that span. Nvidia recently became just the seventh U.S. public company to finish out a trading session with a market capitalization above $1 trillion, and it’s seen as a huge beneficiary of the growing fascination with artificial-intelligence technology.

18,Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,757,xnot88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xnot88/buying_the_stockmarket_dip_is_backfiring_this_year/,592,1664116047.0,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.

Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday. 

That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.

So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. 

“A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. 

Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.

GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. 

U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.

Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.

22,"CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated",552,10root9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10root9/ceo_lisa_su_confirmed_that_amd_has_been/,111,1675340947.0,"AMD is ‘undershipping’ chips to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated
Less supply to balance out demand—and keep prices high.

As the PC industry flounders, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted pay cuts and other extreme measures going forward. AMD’s client PC sales also dropped dramatically—a whopping 51 percent year-over-year—but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren’t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).

“We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,” Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. “We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.”

With the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It’s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.

Despite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.

AMD isn’t the only one doing it, either.

“We’re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we’re seeing,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. “So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.”

Since then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD’s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.

Overall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD’s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).

This all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven’t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect—hope?—that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel’s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.

23,Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in Face of PC Slowdown,477,y1mjl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y1mjl7/intel_plans_to_cut_thousands_of_jobs_in_face_of/,141,1665527599.0,"Intel Corp. is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, to cut costs and cope with a sputtering personal-computer market, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 

The layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.

Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.

Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. 

During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. 

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.

Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.

Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years.

Now a broader slump is adding to those challenges. Intel’s PC, data center and artificial intelligence groups are contending with a tech spending slowdown, weighing on revenue and profit.

PC sales tumbled 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc, and Lenovo Group Ltd., which use Intel’s processors in their laptops and desktop PCs, all suffered steep declines.

It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world’s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. 

At the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits. The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone.

US tensions with China also have clouded the chip industry’s future. The Biden administration announced new export curbs on Friday, restricting what US technologies companies can sell to the Asian nation.

David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming.

Some chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., have said they’re steering clear of layoffs for now. But other tech companies, such as Oracle Corp. and Arm Ltd., have already been cutting jobs.

25,Nvidia ($NVDA) is the best risk-reward short over the next few months,397,12c6sbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12c6sbx/nvidia_nvda_is_the_best_riskreward_short_over_the/,268,1680664995.0,"On a technical-level, $NVDA is absolutely ridiculous. It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/

Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.

As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.

I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.

tl;dr: OTM Puts on $NVDA for May or June 2023. Expect a 20-30% drop in the coming weeks."

This is imo a very promising development.

Whether the Intel chips are on top, the AMD ones, or the Nvidia ones, you always need foundries, and Intel aims to be the third largest offered to third parties by 2025.  
  
If the perf/watt and cost is right, I can see former competitors hopping over, especially with early sweetheart deals to win over some consumers from TSMC which is very overbooked."

* \-24% in Q1 2019

* \-5% in Q4 2019

Nvidia's stock price dropped by about 53% during this period. It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.

This is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?

In the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months. This doesn't even account for electricity cost inflation.

ETH itself is down 30% in the last 7 days.

**Nvidia does not break out its gaming and crypto sales. (Comment: Nvidia ""gaming"" revenue fell short by $1b)** They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact. But if I have to guess, it won't be as bad as 2018 if crypto does not go back up because Nvidia's overall revenue has diversified a bit since 2018.

However, 2018 is very different than 2022 for Nvidia. In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.

Like most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \~13,000 to \~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.

The question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth? Do you think Wallstreet has already priced this in? Right now, Nvidia's PE is still at a premium over the market. What happens when its growth is negative for 4 quarters?

Long term, I still believe in Nvidia. But watch out in the next 1-2 years."
34,Micron Stock Tumbles as China Says Its Chips Are Security Risk,220,13olpot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13olpot/micron_stock_tumbles_as_china_says_its_chips_are/,65,1684747094.0,"Micron Technology Inc.’s stock dropped more than 6% after China’s cyberspace regulator said that its products failed to pass a cybersecurity review in the country.

Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company’s goods, saying it found “relatively serious” cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country. The components caused “significant security risks to our critical information infrastructure supply chain,” which would affect national security, according to the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.Micron’s shares dropped as much as 6.8% in premarket trading, which would be the biggest intraday fall since November if it holds during regular trading. The stock had gained 36% this year, closing at $68.17 on Friday.

The CAC had said about six weeks ago that it was launching a security review of imports from Micron, the US’s last major memory chipmaker.

The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two largest economies, with Washington having already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the Chinese chip industry. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said Beijing’s conclusion had “no basis in fact” and Washington will continue to try and limit industry disruptions with its allies.

**US Chipmakers Are Heavily Reliant on China**

Micron is less dependent on the country than many of its peersPercent of revenue from China

* Qualcomm: 64%
* Broadcom: 35%
* Intel: 27%
* AMD: 22%
* Nvidia: 21%
* Micron: 11%

^(Source: Company data compiled by BloombergNote: In some cases, China revenue includes chips for devices that are exported for sale elsewhere)

“No one should understand this decision by CAC as anything but retaliation for the US’s export controls on semiconductors,” said Holden Triplett, founder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former FBI counterintelligence official in Beijing. “No foreign business operating in China should be deceived by this subterfuge. These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.”

The move brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of chips to the country, which puts the components inside electronic products that are shipped all over the world.

The Chinese cyber agency said in its statement Sunday that, while the country welcomes products and services provided by companies of all countries as long as they comply with its laws and regulations, the investigation into Micron products are a “necessary measure” to safeguard national security. It didn’t detail what the security risks were or identify specific Micron products that are now barred.Micron, which has previously said it stood by the security of its products and commitments to customers, said in a statement Sunday it’s evaluating the conclusion of the review. The company is assessing its next steps, adding that it looks forward “to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.”

Analysts at Jefferies including Edison Lee said in a research report that the CAC’s decision will likely have a small impact on Micron because it focuses on “critical information infrastructure,” meaning operations like data centers and cloud computing services with security risks. Most of Micron’s memory chips sold in China are actually used in consumer electronics, like smartphones and notebooks, they said.

“We believe this ban is narrowly focused as it applies to only CII operators,” they wrote. “Therefore, the ultimate impact on Micron will be quite limited.”

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plunged a record 8.3% while Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. also declined.  The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.

The Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.

The US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays. 

The US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities. 

 “It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.” 

US chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%.

* Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
* Intel’s new reporting structure could help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.
* Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks.

 Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company’s turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

Wednesday’s update featured Intel’s Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company’s manufacturing margins.

Intel’s new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.

The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel’s turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC’s manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls “five nodes in four years.” Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies.

If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm

, which don’t run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year.

“The manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,” Zinsner told analysts. “They’ll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.”

Wednesday’s update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year.

Analysts on the call worried about Intel’s gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins.

Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion.

“This will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,” Zinsner said Wednesday.

Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD

, Intel’s chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%."

* Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.  

* Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.

Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 – and it's also helping the rich get richer.  
  
The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.  
  
Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.  
  
That's helped the companies' founders – already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 – to become even wealthier.

Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called ""year of efficiency"" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  
  
Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.  
  
Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.  
  
And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang – has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.

Great idea for Intel to open a sizable position in ARM as the IPO anchor imo. Intel clearly missed most of the smartphone race apart from some modems before selling even that off, but getting tighter with ARM and becoming the best place to fabricate ARM parts would be a solid addition to the turnaround. Also hedges from singular Nvidia or Apple influence on ARM."

The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

The A800 GPU, or graphics processing unit, went into production in the third quarter and serves as an alternative to the A100 model, Nvidia said in a statement Monday. “The A800 meets the US government’s clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it,” the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said.

**Nvidia** **jarred investors** **earlier this year when it said that it was banned from selling the A100 and forthcoming H100 products to Chinese customers without special US government approval**. The change put hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at risk. The US is concerned that the processors might be used by the military, Nvidia said in a regulatory filing in August.

The Biden administration expanded the restrictions last month, escalating tensions between the two countries and adding fresh hurdles for US chipmakers already facing a slump in demand. Nvidia has lost more than half its value this year, following three straight years of gains. 

Data centers rely on graphics chips like Nvidia’s to handle AI tasks and process huge sets of information. The US government’s rules on China exports place a cap on the speeds that such chips can communicate with each other, thereby limiting their usefulness.

Reuters previously reported that Nvidia had begun offering the A800.

Steve Cohen said investors are too worried about a market downturn and that focusing too much on recession odds may cause them to miss the “big wave” of opportunities brought on by artificial intelligence. 

“I’m making a prognostication — we’re going up,” said Cohen, founder of hedge fund Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets, according to people who heard him speak at a private event Tuesday at Citi Field. “I’m actually pretty bullish.”
Cohen, 66, said the burgeoning field of AI will likely create new jobs. 


The billionaire added that he’s worried about the “types of jobs that will be displaced,” but more broadly, he expects profit margins to improve, which would reduce pressure on the Federal Reserve to curb inflation with additional interest rate hikes. This would, in turn, boost markets, he said. 

Cohen joins other current and former hedge fund managers who have expressed enthusiasm for AI. Duquesne Family Office founder Stan Druckenmiller and Maverick Capital’s Lee Ainslie both took positions in chipmaker Nvidia Corp., a beneficiary of the AI boom, during the first quarter. 

“AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet,” Druckenmiller said last week at the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference."

“We have tried to set conservative forecasts for AMD's Al, given historic false starts, but higher price points plus supply chain commentary is pointing to an opportunity that is multiples of our initial target. Raising Al revs to $400 mm, but with bull case >$1.2 bn for CY24.
We have spent the last few days gathering data points from industry sources on the AMD MI300 (AI) opportunity. Our original estimate of $100 mm of Al revenue in CY24 in addition to other data center GPU such as cloud gaming or supercomputer) was intended to be conservative - and AMD management commentary has also been circumspect - but the opportunity in formation is materially larger. 

Our thought process is that 1) the overall inference market for GPUs is only about $400 mm trailing, and while it's clear that growth will be explosive in the near term, AMD is coming from outside the market, and customer's biggest priority is to reduce cost per query so price will be an issue. 2) We have been here before, where customers state enthusiasm for AMD data center GPUs, but NVIDIA reacts aggressively to defend their turf with very good products and dilute the opportunity, and 3) our price assumptions for MI300 was that it would come at a significant discount to the A100 points of about $9k.
Through conversations with several industry contacts - and to be clear, none of this is coming from AMD management, who has yet to size the opportunity - we are becoming more optimistic on all three fronts.

We continue to hear about more aggressive investment in both training and inference, and our initial numbers were likely too low, as we have discussed recently. While initially we had heard about LLM inference still heavily using (PUs, that appears to be only the case for select low latency applications - which are significant. If there is no urgency for results, CPUs are fine, but for LLM it's clear that hitting the latency requirements needs GPUs or specialty silicon.
In terms of AMD's share of that opportunity, it seems more tangible and durable than our initial expectations, with solid revenue forecasts from two of the four

US hyperscalers - with prospects for a third - at unit levels that materially surprised us. We would still expect NVIDIA to be aggressive in defending its turf, but AMD is seeing solid orders from these customers…”

In a more serious sector of the market, we have $NVDA making a historic move to a new ATH ($380) on the speculation of transformative AI breakthroughs. Recession fears lying dead in the trunk of the starship rocket. With the price of used GPU’s sliding to the downside since early 2022, it’s hard to understand where the priced in demand will come into fruition.   
Last quarter, Nvidia’s profit surged 26% to $2 billion, and sales rose 19% to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia’s outlook for the current quarter was also significantly — about 50% — higher than analysts’ predictions.  
The pump is based on forward earnings estimates along side the speculation on new AI tech. Let’s break down these two individually and see if this historic move is justified.  
Let’s begin with Generative AI as this is the premise for massive forward anticipated demand. So powerful and transformative it will transcend and eclipse the likely incoming recession.  
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.  
   
Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign business processes and transform supply chains.  
What are use cases for generative AI?  
•	Implementing chatbots for customer service and technical support.  
•	Deploying deepfakes for mimicking people or even specific individuals.  
•	Improving dubbing for movies and educational content in different languages.  
•	Writing email responses, dating profiles, resumes and term papers.  
•	Creating photorealistic art in a particular style.  
•	Improving product demonstration videos.  
•	Suggesting new drug compounds to test.  
•	Designing physical products and buildings.  
•	Optimizing new chip designs.  
•	Writing music in a specific style or tone.  
  
These seem like great conveniences for the modern world. Transformative recession resistant groundbreaking technology? Not so much. AMD has shared a small fraction of the liquidity wave incoming for AI tech. They over expanded their business ventures in late 2021 as we slid into a major market pullback based on inflation fears and fed tightening. Is this a leading indicator of what’s to come for NVIDIA’s aggressive expansion moving into a recession yet to be priced in? Maybe.   
NVIDIA has the technicals, financials and narrative on its side. All of which can change on a dime. What really matters are valuations which are flashing red in an alarming way.  
The new all-time high price wasn’t the only new ATH for NVIDIA.  
Let’s look at some indicators for NVIDIA.   


Price to earnings P/E (TTM)  
•	NEW ATH – 218x (2023)  
•	OLD ATH – 97x (2017)  


We’ve seen a significant rise in the P/E ratio in a very short period, which indicates a large amount of speculation on NVIDIA.   


Price to Sales P/S (TTM)  
•	NEW ATH – 34.8x (2023)  
•	OLD ATH – 26.2x (2021)   


P/S at 34.8x is extremely high, it’s also important to note that we’re at higher levels currently than we were at peak mania back in both 2021 & 2017. You will be dead before earnings catch up with current valuations, your children would also likely expire prior to these valuations making sense. We could call this a multi-generational investment strategy at best. Jokes aside, it’s more likely than not that we will see a massive correction in NVIDIA stock price. Insider sell volume continues to grow over the last 3 quarters and is likely to continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.  
Nvidia is not a small startup. Its sales amounted to $27bn over the past year, while its free cash flow came in at $3.8bn, reflecting a free cash flow margin of 14%, which is higher than the NDX average of 12%. Such extreme valuation ratios are rare for large established companies as growth is a declining function of market size.  


The combination of speculative trading activity, particularly in options markets, and the allure of a new game-changing technology often come together to create spikes in stock prices that are far out of line with any fundamental developments. As a stock's price rises, its gain attracts attention and strengthens the credibility of the underlying bullish story, which creates further buying interest. When a high volume of option trading takes place as in the case of Nvidia currently, this adds fuel to the fire as relatively small amounts of individual capital can have an outsized impact on prices.  
We often see investors abandon traditional valuation methods or ignore valuations altogether when a fashionable stock such as Nvidia rallies significantly beyond its earnings potential. Many recent articles on Nvidia do a good job of explaining why the company will grow strongly yet ignore the issue of valuation.  


As much as I enjoy my NVIDIA GPU, AMD has bridged the gap in performance at a cheaper price. NVIDIA are well known for being overpriced in the gaming industry. Future growth at this valuation almost completely relies on AI rapidly improving to another level again from here. This is screaming sell the news IMO. Given everything we’ve gone over and the coming recession, NVIDIA cannot possibly keep up with their projections in the most recent report. If you don’t believe the recession is coming, just remember a 3-month and 10-year inversion has never been wrong.  
It is very easy to see the flaws investing in something like $PEPE or $GME. NVIDIA on the other hand is a good company and does a great job of projecting believable future growth.

**Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first:**

>ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  
Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  
Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  
Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM.  
ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business.

I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.

Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more.

In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft.

ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent.

This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is [ditching stock ARM cores](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16684/ampere-roadmap-full-custom-cores) for their own custom server cores.

Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs.

Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am [one of the few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/s1r0w8/nvidia_was_approached_by_softbank_to_buy_arm_not/hsb30a6/?context=3) on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real.

Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.

ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow.

There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company that valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware."

67,"What stocks will flourish during U.S. ""Reshoring"" trend?",55,z9xm3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z9xm3d/what_stocks_will_flourish_during_us_reshoring/,69,1669924031.0,"Here are my thoughts please feel free to contradict/supplement me since I'm by no means any kind of expert or even moderately knowledgeable in this subject.

I think reshoring is going to be a strong trend given that:

* It would be a popular rally cry from both political parties. It would be very popular cause especially in manufacturing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, etc -- some of which are possibly swing states.

* The more unrest we see out of China and Russia, the more this concept will gain support.

* Some big companies will want to shore up their supply chain (e.g. maybe like car companies with semiconductors). They will lobby hard for this.

* Labor unions should also love this as more manufacturing = more jobs and more union members.

Some effects might be:

* Inflation. Reestablishing manufacturing is going to require initial investment in building factories

* Our labor is more expensive than China's. The labor market is already tight on the supply side right now, if we were to create millions of well paying labor jobs this might create scarcity of labor (will this trigger wage-price spiral)?

* Retaliatory trade wars. Our legislations encouraging re-shoring might be interpreted as anti free trade which may trigger China to launch their own protectionist rules, causing a cycle of hostility (although arguably this was going to happen anyway).

* Revival of a living-wage labor class, or middle class.

So what kind of companies will benefit from this? 

* Companies that help other companies build factories, infrastructure, etc (Like Catepillar).

* Companies that create automation -- like Tesla robots? (I'm sure there's dozens of better companies just serving as eg.)

* Companies that help improve logistics -- like software robot companies, Nvidia, etc.

* Companies that serve a middle class that was shrinking, but maybe will start growing again. Like Target maybe?

* Companies that will build homes around these new factory towns. 

SO what kind of companies will get hurt from this? I'm actually not sure.

Would love your thoughts on any of this, **but especially what companies will benefit/hurt the most and why**?"

I'm new to all this, but I'm curious about investing in NVIDIA and Intel. To me it looks like there are both good and bad things about both so I don't know if it's the right time to invest.

NVIDIA has a huge stake in AI, they make some of the best hardware for it, and AI's huge right now, plus there are leaks (from sources which have previously proven accurate) of a new gaming/creator GPU for the high-end desktop market (a potential Titan RTX ADA or RTX 4090 Ti), which NVIDIA hasn't had an offering for for a few years. However, it sounds like they have a lot of unsold inventory of gaming GPUs, which is concerning.

I have less info on Intel, but there's recently been discussion of future 1.8- and 2-nanometer process nodes from them, which is really promising. However, their recent high-end CPUs have been widely considered ""uncoolable"" when overclocked and extremely difficult to cool when run at stock speeds (see the recent Linus Tech Tips video where they cooled an i9-13900k with a 5000W chiller, titled ""The God of Computer Coolers."" Meanwhile, their gaming GPUs have generally flopped. However, smaller transistors are known to consume less power and generate less heat (although transistor counts will likely massively increase)."

With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.

While I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology. Moreover, investors should consider that the market is already pricing lots of optimism--with NVDA shares valued at a FWD EV/EBIT of close to x60.

&#x200B;

 Tesla is the best-performing stock listed on the S&P 500 year-to-date, rising 69%, while the other five best-performing S&P constituents are streamer Warner Bros. Discovery (up 63%), biotechnology contractor Catalent (59%), orthodontics firm Align Technology (50%) and the cruise liner Royal Caribbean (48%), according to FactSet data.

Despite spanning industries, each of those companies have one thing in common: They were among the worst-performing stocks of 2022, each losing 35% or more last year.

Other notable gainers this year are fellow streamers Paramount (40%) and Disney (21%), Silicon Valley technology giants Nvidia (46%) and Meta (44%) and other leisure travel stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line (44%) and Caesars Entertainment (27%).

 

The S&P’s biggest losers are also a diverse group, led by telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies (-25%) and followed by solar energy company Enphase Energy (-23%), specialty healthcare provider Baxter International (-20%), energy company APA Corp (-18%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Pfizer (-15%).

The decline of Pfizer, by far the worst-performing stock of 2023 with a market capitalization over $100 billion, comes after the company [said](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/31/pfizer-expects-covid-vaccine-and-pill-revenues-will-fall-60-in-2023/?sh=7c9241f37bee) it expected sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and oral treatment will slip 60% in 2023, and headline an onslaught for several big pharmaceutical companies, with peers Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly down 9% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date.

 

KEY BACKGROUND

The S&P 500 is up 6.7% year-to-date after slipping 18% in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008. The slump closely tracked the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from around 0% to over 4% in an effort to slow inflation. In addition to Meta, other mega-cap tech stocks are up dramatically this year, with each of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft up 6% or more.

## TANGENT

Also gaining thus far in 2023 is bitcoin, up almost 50% year-to-date at about $25,000, an eight-month high. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam warned Monday that investors must be wary of the latest rally for the cryptocurrency, explaining: “We've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos,” referring to bitcoin’s dramatic 75% nosedive between November 2021 and November 2022.

## SURPRISING FACT

U.S. military contractor Northrop Grumman is the sixth-worst performing S&P constituent year-to-date, [despite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/02/15/chinese-spy-balloon-graphic-reminder-of-geopolitical-market-risks-heres-what-it-means-for-stocks/?sh=afd798e78889) a recent rally for it and other defense stocks as geopolitical tensions stewed.

## BIG NUMBER

$61.3 billion. That’s how much Musk has tacked onto his fortune so far this year during Tesla’s rally, roughly the size of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s total fortune. Musk, who lost his position as the world’s wealthiest person in December, is $15 billion away from reclaiming the title from LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

Hey Everyone,
First time posting on here. Me and my fiancé are working on reallocating our money in our retirement fund to reduce some risk to the downside over the coming year. Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.

20% S&P index fund,
XLK - 5%,
XLI - 5%,
XLP - 20.25%,
XLU - 10%,
XLB - 2.5%,
XLV - 18%,
XLC - 5%,
XLE - 5.5%,
5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.

Essentially we’re leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.

Remaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.

Edit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into ANY companies we like for the long run. Those are just the ones we thought of off the top of our heads. Open to suggestions here, they don’t have to be tech companies."

On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.

On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.

Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led ""baby bubble"" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.

Even though, Q2 earnings were anticipated and matched revised estimates, the Q3 revenue guidance of $5.7Bn was way below consensus estimates of $6.7Bn.

A few takeaways from the earnings call.

They guided to 65% gross margins for Q3 - Given the weakness in ASP's for gamin chips - is it achievable?

I was trying to estimate Q3 gaming revenues.

From the earnings call

Analyst ""I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I’ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming""

CFO - ""And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2.Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2.""

Based on management's revenue estimate of $5.7Bn and the commentary above, I'm getting these estimates for Q3.

All Numbers in Millions.

Data Center - $3,871 - sequential growth of 3%  
Auto -$221 - sequential growth of 5%  
Viz - $500, the same as Q2  
OEM - $130, the same as Q2  
**GAMING - If $5,700 is the total then that leaves only - $1,000 for gaming, which is a sequential drop of 50%.**

Does that make sense?

**Alternatively, a sequential drop of 30% would put gaming at $1,428, then the revenue total goes to $6,100**

Sandbagging? Difficult to tell.

The markets are fairly sanguine about $NVDA's prospects , the stock is up 2% to $177 after falling to $164 in extended trading, I didn't see downward revisions.

I'm keen on picking up some if it declines another 5% from here, but that is looking difficult."

Also, in the piece for reference:

""Two decades from now, Huang may look back on 2002 with similar clarity.

Hi all

I'm not here to shit on anything. But I use to trade options on MPW. There were a few things that were yellow flags for me. Yellow flags meaning they might be issues or could indicate issues but alone are not enough to disqualify MPW for me.

1. High premium usually indicates high risk. REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia.
2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons. The biggest concern is fundamentals of the company. Another is a possible dividend cut.
3. MPW recently wrote down a pretty substantial amount of money from one of their tenants going into bankruptcy. This was given in their last earnings report/call. This would explain the drop in share price in the last couple weeks.

Then I came across some things online. The info to me turns those yellow flags into big red flags. So I just wanted to share this and get feedback. Links below.

88,Ways to estimate how ServiceNow and NVIDIA Partnership Impact ServiceNow's Bottom Line and share price?,24,13srmqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13srmqq/ways_to_estimate_how_servicenow_and_nvidia/,14,1685143143.0,"Hello r/Stocks,I've been trying to understand how to capitalize on the ongoing AI boom. I've been looking into ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), which recently announced a partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA).  


In articles from May 17, 2023, NVDA mentioned their plan to develop enterprise-grade generative AI capabilities to enhance business processes with faster, smarter workflow automation with NOW. NVDA's technology and infrastructure will be key to developing these custom large language models specifically for NOW platform.  


ServiceNow already has some AI features, but this new partnership could introduce more uses for generative AI across the enterprise. It sounds like this could make a big difference to IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers by strengthening workflow automation and quickly increasing productivity.  


It also seems like NOW will be using this new AI tech to help NVIDIA improve its own IT operations.They're working on various applications of generative AI to improve productivity. For example, they're developing intelligent virtual assistants and agents for handling user queries and support requests, as well as tools for customer service agents for automatic issue resolution and knowledge-base article generation.  


On NVIDIA's end, they're providing AI Foundations cloud services and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes the NVIDIA NeMo framework. It looks like these tools will help developers build, customize, and deploy language models for different enterprise use cases.  


How do you think this partnership could impact NOW' bottom line? Do you believe investing in NOW is a good way to take advantage of the AI boom, given this partnership with NVIDIA?  


I'm eager to learn more about this and I appreciate any insight you all might be able to provide. Thanks!"

Today, $NVDA released preliminary earnings report which was disappointing and it was expected, IMO. However, why did Nvidia not wait until Aug 24th for official report? Is there any reason, you can think of, that made Nvidia release preliminary earnings report just 2 weeks before official ER?

93,Activision: Proving doubters wrong,18,12399a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12399a3/activision_proving_doubters_wrong/,12,1679886187.0,"Posted this a month ago as a reply to a fellow redditor asking about the ATVI deal.

*But here are some points. You can easily find out more info online as it’s widely available data and info.*

* *upside case obviously is a 24ish % at current prices, and best part is you get it all back in cold hard cash, not MSFT shares. That is big upside considering the market environment and recessionary fears impacting sentiment this year*
* *downside case is a failure of the deal to go through, but then MSFT has to pay ATVI a breakup fee of 2-3bn in cash, which ATVI can use to buyback shares or conduct a special dividend.*

*Of course most people would be concerned w the question: how far will ATVI fall if the deal falls through?*

* *assuming that ATVI would return to trading at the multiples of its closest peers (Nintendo, Sony, EA, take two), a reasonable estimate would be \~$65-69 range EXCLUDING the impact of the break up fee, which is just about its price range before the acquisition announcement.*
* *if (AND A BIG IF) you include the cash breakup fee and assume that ATVI decides to return part of that to shareholders, one could see an additional $0.50 to $2 per share added on top of the range above.*
* *So actually the downside doesn’t seem all too bad, at around \~15% (assuming it really does fall to $65). This puts risk-reward ratio at 1.6 (24%/15%), which ain’t too bad at all. Morgan Stanley has also done it’s own downside analysis as well and predicted a price floor of $65 as well, and currently rates it a buy.*
* *to top it off it’s a fundamentally strong company as well, with game IPs and brands that are globally recognised and successful. It generates good cash flow and still has decent growth runway at least for the next 5 years, given that the gaming industry is still considered “mid to high growth”. Active user base continues to grow in the single digits and even the pandemic did not slow the business down as much as others.*
* *It’s latest call of duty release was it’s most successful ever as the company continues to be able to execute strongly on how to capture more gamers yet retain its existing one and monetise them well. It has a proven track record of developing, marketing and maintaining triple AAA titles. Balance sheet is healthy and there really aren’t much complaints with its fundamentals other than some controversies here and there.*
* *there are really only 3 regulators the deal needs to clear, FTC, EU and UK CMA. All 3 are seemingly on the side of not letting this pass. FTC has alr filed a lawsuit against ATVI, while both EU and UK CMA have raised concerns and papers of their own. Perhaps they are all playing the waiting game - if one regulator opposes it as the first mover, its much easier to “rationalize” opposing it as well, but the question is who would want to be that first mover? On the flip side, If one regulator approves it first, the chances of the deal going through would jump significantly as the others might just follow suit. Perhaps if you don’t like the uncertainty now, you could wait for some positive news (like a first major approval) and sacrifice some upside potential for more certainty. Prices could easily jump up to 83-86 by then.*

*Personally I hold q a significant amount of ATVI (\~12% of my pf), because I hold conviction that MSFT has the right people in place to recognise how impt this deal is to them and to negotiate a concession agreement that makes everyone happy. MSFT has never failed an acquisition in its entire history and it lends some confidence that it has the right people, strategy and relationships in place to see this out. It’s unlikely the deal will settle so soon, a more realistic timeline would be Q3 or even early Q4 due to complexity and size of this deal and the amount of stakeholders involved.*

*Interestingly enough, as the price has been so flat since the announcement of the acquisition I had the extra benefit of this position buffering my portfolio from some of the market downside (reducing volatility) and actually I somehow (luckily) outperformed many indexes last year. The price action is lowly correlated to the market at this point but rather to developments on the deal.*

*People saying that “this deal is too big to fail” know nothing, don’t listen to them. Any deal, no matter the size, can fail still, so do still manage how risk adverse you are.*

&#x200B;

Last week the UK regulator basically made a u turn on its provisional findings:

*After reviewing what it called “new evidence”, the Competition and Markets Authority said on Friday that it no longer thought there would be a “substantial lessening of competition” in the console market if the Xbox maker takes over the publisher of the bestselling game franchise.*

Price gapped up to \~$84 as of Friday close, and now the spread to deal price is about 12%. Although the risk reward may not seem as favorable as it once was when it was hovering around the 75-77 range the past 6-months, I still think there is opportunity present for those looking for a short term tactical trade idea (3-6 months)

* Just like in the EU regulator, the focus for UK is now exclusively on cloud gaming and anti competitive effects; which is a major win for the deal
* MSFT has boosted its efforts in soothing regulators nerves within cloud on top of consoles - most recently 2 10 year deals with boosteroid and ubitus (cloud gaming providers) on top of mega partnerships with Nvidia and nintendo
* As of now, 4 jurisdictions have cleared the deal (Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Serbia, Chile)
* The tone of the narrative in the markets surrounding this deal has clearly shifted - it has changed from criticism of the anti competitiveness of the deal towards a finding solution set that makes all parties happy
* The next 2 months will be especially closely watched -  Decision dateline for CMA end april, decision dateline NZ end april, decision dateline for EU end may, FTC expert reports start may.
* Citi has upgraded its probability of the deal closing from 50% to 70% last Friday
* MSFT has won dismissal of a private consumer antitrust lawsuit (first sued in late december 22)
* It now looks likely that EU and UK will both clear the deal - Though uncertain, a continued push by the US FTC to challenge the deal becomes increasingly complex in the face of its 2 peers, a wise move would be to align itself with the EC and CMA in recognizing that there is no console related anti competitive effects. When that happens, we all know where the deal is finally heading towards.

*As always, past performance is not indicative of future performance. This is not financial advice, do your own due diligence and risk-manage accordingly.*"
94,Can Someone ELI5 Me How To Read Fiscal Year Revenue Report?,19,103m9ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/103m9ef/can_someone_eli5_me_how_to_read_fiscal_year/,9,1672883909.0,"I am still new, and would like to learn about fiscal year usage in press releases. Why do some companies use year+1 for the revenue report? For example, this one: [https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2023](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2023)  


Why does it say ""Q3 FY23"" when the report was released in November 2022? I thought this number was supposedly for FY22? Can someone explain? For comparison, Microsoft recent release is this: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2022-Q3/performance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2022-Q3/performance#:~:text=Earnings%20Release%20FY22%20Q3&text=Revenue%20increased%20%247.7%20billion%20or,Azure%20and%20other%20cloud%20services)  


Here MSFT used the term ""FY22 Q3"", which is correct, but NVDA use the term ""Q3 FY23"" which is like a future tense, can someone explain?"
95,My thoughts on the unconfirmed report that Amazon will acquire Electronic Arts,19,wyjkyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wyjkyg/my_thoughts_on_the_unconfirmed_report_that_amazon/,29,1661546226.0,"Electronic Art's stock was up 4% today because of an unconfirmed report that Amazon will be acquiring the company. I'm not clear if Amazon will move forward with the bid, but I'm not surprised that Electronic Arts will be acquired sooner rather than later. We already know that Apple, Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal have been discussing acquiring the company since May '22. There are also other big tech players like Meta, Google, Nvidia, Netflix, and Nike who are potential suitors given their aspirations for the metaverse, they already missed out on Activision Blizzard after agreeing to be acquired by Microsoft, and there is a low supply of targets with the customer base & intellectual property that EA has to help them reach their metaverse goals.

&#x200B;

Extra background about EA's being potentially acquired:  [Report: EA Looking To Sell Or Merge (kotaku.com.au)](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/05/report-ea-looking-to-sell-or-merge/)

Link is a sensitivity analysis of possible valuations for EA: [https://imgur.com/a/3Boxkl0](https://imgur.com/a/3Boxkl0)

&#x200B;

Two key takeaways:

&#x200B;

* According to my analysis, a fair value (*yellow*) would be at least **+$173/share or +30% upside** from today's price. That would be consistent with EA's FY '23 EBITDA guidance for **+$2,400m** and a **20.0x** multiple for a software company that is growing the top-line by high single-digits and +30% EBITDA margins.

&#x200B;

* ATVI was acquired by Microsoft for a **17.5x** multiple. Applying that same multiple to EA's EBITDA guidance (*blue*) would imply **$150/share or +13% upside** from today's price. In my view, that **17.5x** multiple for EA is the **floor** because ATVI merited a lower multiple given internal scandals and declining performance for Call of Duty."

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, the first day of September, as traders continued to fret over the potential for higher Federal Reserve rates.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 143 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
> The moves came as the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.516%, the highest level since November 2007, at one point Thursday.
*****
> Nvidia shares also contributed to the losses, falling more than 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker said the U.S. government is restricting some sales in China.
*****
> The major averages are coming off four straight days of losses. On Wednesday, the final day of August, the Dow slid nearly 0.9%. The S&P 500 lost about 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell roughly 0.6%.
*****
> The Dow closed the month down about 4.1%, while the S&P and Nasdaq recorded losses of 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively.

*****
> “If we retest the lows, I think it happens in September,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” However, she added, “I think in order to do so, something would have to get materially worse than it was on June 16,” when stocks bottomed, such as earnings revisions that come in worse than investors are expecting.

# **Dow leaps 700 points on hot jobs report, Nasdaq notches sixth straight winning week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Friday as traders cheered a strong jobs report and the passage of a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow jumped 701.19 points, or 2.12%, to end at 33,762.76 — its best day since January. The S&P 500 climbed 1.45% to close at 4,282.37. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.07% to 13,240.77, reaching its highest level since April 2022 during the session.
*****
> With Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished the holiday-shortened trading week about 1.8% and 2% higher, respectively. The Dow’s Friday advance pushed it into positive territory for the week, finishing up around 2%. The Nasdaq notched its sixth straight week higher, a streak length not seen for the technology-heavy index since 2020.
*****
> Nonfarm payrolls grew much more than expected in May, rising 339,000. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a relatively modest 190,000 increase. It marked the 29th straight month of positive job growth.
*****
> Recently strong employment data had been pressuring stocks on the notion it would keep the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. But Friday data also showed average hourly earnings rose less than economists expected year over year, while the unemployment rate was higher than anticipated.
*****
> Both data points have given investors hope that the Fed could pause its interest rate hike campaign at the policy meeting later this month, according to Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
*****
> “The so-called Goldilocks has entered the house,” Sandven said. “Clearly, on the bullish side, there are signs that inflation is starting to wane, speculation that the Fed is going to move into pause mode, increasing the likelihood of a soft landing.”
*****
> Easing concerns around the U.S. debt ceiling also helped sentiment. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday night, sending the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. That comes after the House passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday, just days before the June 5 deadline set by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
*****
> Lululemon shares popped more than 11% on strong results and a guidance boost, while MongoDB surged 28% on a blowout forecast.

> # A Resilient Labor Market = A Resilient Economy

> Another month, another employment surprise. Should we be surprised anymore?

> Economists expected payrolls to grow by about 187,000 in May. That’s still a solid job growth number, but a stepdown from what we’ve seen this year through April. However, actual payroll growth beat expectations for the 14th straight month.

> The economy created 339,000 jobs in May, close to double expectations. Better still, payroll growth in March and April were revised higher by a total of 93,000!

> * March payrolls were revised up by 52,000, from 165,000 to 217,000
> * April payroll were revised up by 41,000, from 253,000 to 294,000

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-monthly-payroll-growth-601x800.png))**

> We’ve got two months of payroll data since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March, and nothing suggests weakness arising from that banking crisis.

> Over the first five months of the year, the economy’s added 1.5 million jobs. That in a nutshell tells you how the economy is doing. For perspective, the average annual payroll growth between 1940 and 2022 was 1.5 million. During the last expansion, 2010-2019, average annual payroll growth was 2.2 million per year.

> **But what about the unemployment rate?**

> The unemployment rate did rise from a 50-year low of 3.4% to 3.7%. This does raise some cause for concern but digging through the data suggests it may be noise more than anything else.

> It probably helps to understand that the job growth and unemployment rate data come from different sources. The former comes from asking about 120,000+ businesses how many people they hired. The latter comes from asking about 60,000 households about their employment status. No surprise, the latter is noisier.

> A big reason for the weak household survey (and rising unemployment rate) is that more than 400,000 people who were self-employed said they were no longer employed. As you can see in the following chart this is very noisy data, but the recent trend seems to be toward lower self-employment. It’s basically reversing the surge we saw in 2021, when self-employment surged. So, what we’re seeing now may simply be normalization of the labor market as more workers move from self-employment to W2 jobs with an employer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-03-self-employment-600x800.png))**

> Also, the unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

> The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio dropped only a tick, from 80.8% to 80.7%. This still leaves it higher than at any point between 2002 and 2022.

> All in all, the labor market remains strong and resilient, despite all the recession calls. Perhaps its not as strong as the headline payroll growth number of 339,000 suggests, but any number above 150,000 would be good at this point. And we’re certainly well above that.

> In fact, looking at the job growth and employment-population data, this labor market is probably the strongest we’ve seen since the late 1990’s. Our view since the end of last year has been that the economy can avoid a recession this year, and nothing we’ve seen to date suggests we need to reverse that view. Far from it.

> # June Better in Pre-Election Years

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec249140db7c204c701710238c59b59b/b895a3bf7e06e04f-80/s500x750/cc1f8b1909a82cb97e3496a674dc57c5ec1ea497.jpg))**

> Since 1971 June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks as a rule ranking eighth best with an 0.8% average gain, up 29 of 52 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best 8 Months” which ends in June. Small caps also fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in June since 1979 advancing 63.6% of the time.

> June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.02% average gain).

> Despite being much stronger S&P 500 pre-election year June ranks fifth best. For the rest it is just sixth best. Average monthly gains in pre-election year June range from DJIA 1.1% to a respectable 2.4% for NASDAQ. Russell 2000 has been the most consistently bullish in pre-election years, up 8 of the last 11 (72.7% of the time).

> # The June Swoon?

> Stocks did it again, as the S&P 500 gained 0.2% in the month of May, making it now 10 of the past 11 years that stocks finished green in May. Of course, it gained only 0.01% last year and only 0.25% this year, so the recent returns weren’t off the charts by any measure.

> Looking specifically at this year, tech added more than 9% in May, thanks to excitement over AI and Nvidia, with communication services and consumer discretionary also in the green, while the other eight sectors were lower.

> Specifically, turning to the month of June, stocks historically have hit a bit of trouble here. Since 1950, up 0.03% on average, the fourth worst month of the year. Over the past 20 years, only January and September have been worse and in the past decade, it is again the fourth worst month. The one bit of good news is during a pre-election year is it up 1.5%, the fifth-best month of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-800x338.png))**

> Here’s another chart we’ve shared before, but years that gained big in January (like 2023) tend to see some periods of consolidation in late May/early June, but eventually experience a surge higher into July. Given the flattish overall May, this could be playing out again.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-800x278.png))**

> What if stocks were having a good year heading into June? Since 1950, if the S&P 500 was up more than 8% for the year going into June (like this year), the month of June was up an impressive 1.2% on average versus the average June return of 0.03%, while in a pre-election year the returns jumped to 1.8%. The percent of the time where returns were higher gets better as well, from 54.8% in your average June to nearly 74% if up 8% or more for the year heading into June, to 80% of the time higher if up 8% for the year in a pre-election year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-3-800x342.png))**

> Overall, it has been a very nice run for stocks this year and we remain overweight stocks in the Carson Investment Research House Views. June could potentially cause some volatility, but when all is said and done, we wouldn’t bet against more strength and higher prices in June.

*****

> # NASDAQ and Russell 2000 Lead June Pre-Election Strength

> Over the last 21 years, June has been a rather lackluster month. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. Russell 2000 has fared better with a modest average gain. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days.

> From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and returned to losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally led by technology and small caps.

> Historical performance in pre-election years has been much stronger with all five indexes finishing with average gains. June’s overall pattern in pre-election is similar to the last 21-years pattern with a brief, shallow pullback after a solid start.

> In pre-election years the mid-month rally has been much more robust beginning around the sixth trading day and lasting until the fifteenth. Followed by another modest retreat and rally into the end of Q2.

> # May and YTD 2023 Asset Class Performance

> May 2023 is now behind us, and below is a look at how various asset classes performed during the month using US-listed exchange-traded products as proxies. We also include YTD and YoY total returns.

> May was a month of divergence where Tech/AI soared, and the rest of the market fell. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) gained 7.88% in May while the Dow Jones Dividend ETF (DVY) fell 7.7%. That's a 15 percentage-point spread!

> At the sector level, it was a similar story. While the Tech sector (XLK) rose 8.9%, sectors like Energy (XLE), Consumer Staples (XLP), Materials (XLB), and Utilities (XLU) fell more than 5%. In total, 8 of 11 sectors were in the red for the month.

> Outside the US, we saw pullbacks in most areas of the world other than Brazil, India, and Japan. China, Hong Kong, France, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the UK all fell more than 5%.

> All of the commodity-related ETFs/ETNs were in the red for May, with oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) falling the most at more than 10% each.

> Finally, fixed-income ETFs also fell in May as interest rates bounced back. The aggregate bond market ETF (AGG) was down 1.14% in May, leaving it up just 2.6% YTD and down 2.2% year-over-year.

> # How Worried Should We Be About Consumer Debt?

> A very common question we get these days is whether we’re concerned about the massive increase in consumer debt.

> Short answer: No. Well, not yet anyway. But let’s walk through it in 6 charts.

> The New York Federal Reserve (NY Fed) releases a quarterly report on household debt and credit, and the latest one that was released last week came with the headline:

> “Household Debt Hits $17.05 Trillion in First Quarter.”
> But let’s look at the details. Household debt increased by $148 billion in Q1. That translates to a 0.9% increase, which is the slowest quarterly increase in two years. Most of the increase in debt was from mortgage originations ($121 billion) – mortgage debt makes up $12 trillion of the total $17 trillion in debt. The rest was auto loan and student loan balances.

> Here’s something interesting: credit card balances were flat in Q1, at $986 billion. The fact that overall balances are higher than where they were in 2019 ($927 billion) should not be surprising given we just experienced a lot of inflation. Prices rose at the fastest pace in 40 years, and so you should expect card balances to increase. However, incomes rose as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-credit-card-debt-601x800.png))**

> When you think debt, the key question is whether households are able to service that debt. A good measure of that is to look at debt service costs as a percent of disposable income. As of Q4 2022, that’s at 9.7%, slightly lower than what it was before the pandemic and well below the historical average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-debt-service-disposable-income-608x800.png))**

> There’s even better news: disposable income grew 2.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Significantly higher than the 0.9% increase in total household debt, let alone interest costs!

> Part of that includes the large boost to social security income due to inflation adjustments in January. Also, tax brackets were adjusted higher, resulting in more money in household wallets.

> But even if you exclude these one-off increases, disposable income growth has been strong between February and April, rising at a 5% annualized pace. In fact, employee compensation by itself has risen at a 3.9% annualized pace over the past three months. Meanwhile, inflation is running just about 3% – which means households are seeing real income gains (adjusted for inflation).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-income-vs-inflation-602x800.png))**

> This is why consumers don’t feel the need to borrow to the extent they did before the pandemic. Credit utilization rates measure credit card balances as a percent of available credit. As you can see in the following chart, utilization rates for both credit cards and home equity lines of credit are well below pre-pandemic averages.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-credit-utilization-rates-609x800.png))**

> **Lack of stress showing in delinquency data as well**

> Another way to look for signs of consumer stress is to look at the debt delinquency data. As of the first quarter, the NY Fed survey showed that the percent of loan balances that were more than 90 days delinquent was stable around 1.5%. That’s down from 1.9% a year ago, and quite a bit below the 3% average in 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-balances-by-delinquency-status-800x580.png))**

> Even third-party collections are at record lows, with just over 5% of consumers having collections against them as of the first quarter. This is down from 6% a year ago and below the 2019 average of 9.2%. The average collection amount per person is $1,316, which is lower than the $1,452 average in late 2019. This is surprising because just with inflation you’d have thought the amount would be higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-31-third-party-collections-800x580.png))**

> All in all, the data on consumer finances is not showing much cause for concern. So, count us in the “not worried” camp. At least, not yet.

*****

> # Some Good Inflation News

> While the market prices in a much higher likelihood of a rate hike at the June meeting, there was actually some decent news on the inflation front today. Starting with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence report, in this month's update, the inflation expectations component fell to 6.1% from a peak of 7.9% fifteen months ago in March 2022 (first time reading touched 7.9%). Looking at the chart below, this reading was also at 6.1% fifteen months before that first peak. In other words, for all the talk about how inflation has been stickier, the pace of decline in this indicator on the way down has been the same as the pace of increase on the way up.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/053023-Conference-Board1.png))**

> Another notable report was today's release of the Dallas Fed Manufacturing report. The Prices Paid component of that report showed a decline from 19.5 down to 13.8 which was the lowest reading since July 2020. For the month of May, two of the five components (Empire and Philadelphia) showed modest m/m increases from multi-month lows, and three showed significant declines to multi-month lows. The chart below shows a composite of the Prices Paid component using the z-scores for each of the five individual components going back to 2010. The peak for this component was 19 months ago in November 2021. Unlike the inflation expectations of the Conference Board survey, this reading hasn't declined quite as fast as it increased in the 19 months leading up to the peak, but at -0.2, it is still below its historical average dating back to 2010 and back down to levels it was at right before the COVID shock hit the economy in early 2020.

> # Home Prices Bounce in Hardest Hit Areas

> March data on home prices across the country were released today with updated S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller numbers. Case Shiller home prices had been falling rapidly in many of the twenty cities tracked, but in March we actually saw a pretty big month-over-month bounce in some of the hardest-hit areas like San Diego, San Francisco, LA, Denver, and Phoenix. Some cities still saw declines, however. Las Vegas saw a m/m drop of 0.93%, while Miami fell 0.41%, and Seattle fell 0.28%.

> On a year-over-year basis, Miami is still up the most with a gain of 10.86%. As shown in the table below, Miami home prices are up 59.87% from pre-COVID levels in February 2020, and they're only down 2.9% from post-COVID highs. Only Tampa is up more than Miami from pre-COVID levels (+61.04%), but Tampa prices are down more from their post-COVID highs (-4.70%) than Miami (-2.90%).

> Four cities are down more than 10% from their post-COVID highs: San Diego (-10.12%), Las Vegas (-10.95%), San Francisco (-16.35%), and Seattle (-16.50%). New York is down the least from post-COVID highs of any city tracked at just -2.9%.

> Below we include charts of home price levels across all 20 cities tracked by Case Shiller along with the three composite indices. We've included a vertical red line on each chart to highlight pre-COVID levels. When looking through the charts, you can see this month's small bounce back in most cities after a 6-9 month pullback in prices from peaks seen early last year.

# [Stock futures inch higher after House passes debt ceiling bill: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Thursday after the U.S. House passed a debt ceiling bill in a crucial step to avoid a U.S. default, with the measure now moving it to the Senate.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 8 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.2% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
> The Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by a vote of 314-117 with bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he hopes “we can move the bill quickly here in the Senate and bring it to the president’s desk as soon as possible.”
*****
> Concern over a possible U.S. debt default lingered on Wall Street throughout May — which concluded Wednesday. Last month was also marked by a dramatic rally in artificial intelligence-related stocks.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite ended May with a 5.8% gain as enthusiasm around AI continued to boost related stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia jumped 36% in May, briefly touching a $1 trillion market cap this week. Alphabet, Meta and Amazon all rose at least 10% during the month.
*****
> Outside of tech, gains were hard to come by, however. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% in the month, while the blue-chip Dow fell almost 3.5%, dragged down by Nike, Walt Disney and Chevron.
*****
> “We have been impressed by the resilience of this market since the March low, absorbing a relentless onslaught of negative sentiment and headlines,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler.
*****
> Beyond the debt ceiling battle, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s June 13-14 policy meeting as another possible market catalyst. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Wednesday that he’s leaning toward skipping a rate hike at the upcoming gathering. However, he added that Friday’s payrolls report could change his mind.
*****
> A slew of economic data is set for release Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and the purchasing managers’ index.
*****
> Nordstrom jumped 4% in premarket trading after its fiscal first-quarter sales beat Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce shares fell about 6% after the software company bumped up its full-year forecast but reported higher capital expenses than expected.

104,Why or why not buy Disney?,15,yq6bva,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yq6bva/why_or_why_not_buy_disney/,79,1667961650.0,"
   Greetings, all!  I’ve starting trading with some success, but I’ve been careful.  I think I’m attracted to value companies, because the economics make sense to me.

I’m having trouble understanding the benefit buying a company like Disney at $90 (after hours), which lacks a dividend and has a PE of 57.  I’m comparing it to stocks like Ford (4% dividend, PE of 6).  

I know there are many growth stocks like Disney, but none of them seem to have the intrinsic value to justify their prices:  I submit Google. Meta, Carvanna, AMD, NVIDIA, etc, etc, that just deflated when the next [sucker] chose not to buy the inflated asset.

I know I’m missing something, so I’m hoping all of you kind souls can educate me.  It *seems* Disney is oversold, but the rational part of me thinks the stock should be trading at $40.

I appreciate your sage advice and wisdom."

Would a portfolio of these 4 stocks to buy and hold long-term be a good choice for long-term gains? Looking for good growth….

25% APPLE
25% MICROSOFT 
25% GOOGLE 
25% NVIDIA 

Or would this be too risky in your opinion? Being only 4 stocks and all in the technology sector."

Amazon and google and nvidia sure are big players but since they do everything else I’m also looking at robotics specific stocks that might have a bright future in 10-15 years. 

Warehouse robots and manual labor robots. Self driving tech. Military, ai And so on. 

I see some from Japan but hard to figure them out. Even worse the Chinese ones.

# [Stock futures fall as traders await debt ceiling progress in Washington: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were lower Wednesday as investors kept an eye on the federal debt ceiling debate in Washington ahead of the final trading day of May.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 33 points, or about 0.1%. S&P 500 futures slid 0.15%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were down 0.17%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after a muted day of trading on Tuesday that saw the Dow shed about 50 points while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3%.
*****
> Heading into the final trading day of May, the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 6.5% for the month. The S&P 500, however, is up only about 0.9%, while the Dow has fallen 3.1%.
*****
> The outperformance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq is due in large part to the excitement around artificial intelligence, which briefly pushed Nvidia’s market cap above $1 trillion on Tuesday. However, many on Wall Street are worried that the market’s strength has been too narrow.
*****
> “We’re not seeing any signs of broad participation. We’re not seeing signs of early cyclicals on top of A.I.,” said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors in Dallas.
*****
> One factor that has weighed on the market in recent weeks is the fight over the debt ceiling. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced a deal over the weekend to cap federal baseline spending for two years and raise the debt ceiling, but the agreement has not yet been ratified.
*****
> The deal cleared a major test Tuesday night after advancing to the House floor following a 7-6 vote in the House Rules Committee. The floor vote is expected to take place around 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.
*****
> “I think we have the votes to pass this today,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry, a GOP negotiator on the debt deal, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday morning.

I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  


* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. 
* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.
* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-break a sale. 

Other (not validated) ideas: OLED (as OLED technology it´s getting mainstream), CUERVO (Tequila industry), perhaps Herman Miller and Steelcase in the premium office chair segment?, Dolby (audio technology) and potentially Sonos in the future.

I'd love to hear from you. What other industries and players fit a similar profile?"

I am an amateur at stocks but I do invest in growth tech companies “apple, Nvidia, AMD, etc…” 

Any advice will be great, maybe your top 3 best recommended? Additionally, should I just leave money in there or should I switch around? 

Thank you!

I currently put about 80% of my saving each month (About 4100 USD) to S&P500 (VOO) and the last 20% are divided between multiple technology stocks, mostly Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and AMD (very original, I know). Recently I thought of dividing the last 20% differently and giving 10-15% to 1 company that I believe in instead of dividing it between them ""randomly"" as I did until now, and I thought of Google for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

\* AI - I use AI technologies and ChatGPT daily. I think that while Google are currently behind, they will eventually catch up and be a leader in the sector. They show impressive advancements recently, and not only that there are signs that they are leading the sector in other areas, like physical robots (Like the awesome video where they play soccer/football). On the other hand, Microsoft bought their usage of AI and rely almost entirely on OpenAI to advance the field for them, which is risky and might lead to many issues in the long run.

\* Quantum computing - This market is clearly going to change the world when it becomes mainstream, and Google is currently a leader in the area. They continue developing and researching in the field and continue to show progress, including this year.A combination of advancing in AI in the shorter term and being a strong company in quantum computing in the long run leads me to believe that Google might be a good investment for the long run, possibly more than other technology companies.

Of course I am 100% aware that no one can perdict he future and don't intend to put everything in one basket, but I still wonder what your thoughts are, and if I should put more into Google than other tech companies."

# **Dow jumps 500 points to break four-day losing streak as regional banks and Apple shares surge: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> Stocks popped on Friday as regional bank shares climbed off their lows and market-darling Apple jumped after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 546.64 points, or 1.65%, to close at 33,674.38. The S&P 500 climbed 1.85%, ending the day at 4,136.25. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.25% and closed at 12,235.41.
*****
> Despite Friday’s rally, the Dow and the S&P 500 logged their worst week since March. The 30-stock Dow lost 1.24%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%. The Nasdaq eked out a small weekly gain of 0.07%.
*****
> Stocks rose even as April’s jobs numbers came in hotter than expected. The U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs in April. Wall Street had expected 180,000 new jobs, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Late Thursday, Apple posted beats on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal second quarter, propelled by iPhone sales. Apple shares gained about 4.7%.
*****
> The rebound for regional bank stocks was boosted by a note from JPMorgan, which upgraded Western Alliance, Zions Bancorp and Comerica to overweight. The firm said those three banks appear “substantially mispriced” in part due to short-selling activity. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) advanced more than 6%. PacWest — which is down sharply this week on news it’s considering strategic options that include a sale — popped 81.7%. Western Alliance also jumped 49.2%.
*****
> Shares of regional banking companies have been under pressure this week, as traders fear other institutions could suffer the same fate as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Both banks collapsed in March.
*****
> Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, doesn’t believe the fallout in the regional banking sector is over despite Friday’s rebound. “When the whole news cycle started, it was sort-of explained away … as a unique circumstance for certain institutions. The reality is that liquidity is a universal challenge,” she said.
*****
> “The issue originally was that deposit flight was occurring. … But now that the pressure is no longer necessarily deposit flight. It’s this mark to market of the securities on all their books,” Young continued.
*****
> “So I don’t think that this news cycle isn’t necessarily over. … I also don’t think it dies of natural causes in the sense [that] it heats up and then just kind of cools down with no effect,” she added.

> # Don’t Fear the Seasons – Sell in May

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4b650404c70d0d2b310a6171718523dd/a799179fa63c7cb2-11/s500x750/18347719a303c4b0dc4ab8399bb475cd058b692f.jpg))**

> But don’t go away. We actually sold some positions in April when we issued our MACD Best 6 Months Seasonal Sell Signal to Almanac Investor subscribers. Reposition in May is a better strategy. Best & Worst Months stats plus a compounding onetime $10K investment tell the story. Can’t argue with success.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d4ea08ecebc2a62dd65b8d8ef604fdb/a799179fa63c7cb2-9e/s500x750/24cdaa9e31771ebf238f566783c2cf859c9794db.jpg))**

> Worst Six Months May-October is not a binary selloff. Risk is elevated historically, stocks tend to be volatile, moving sideways with choppy trading – illustrated in the chart. Anyone who tries to refute this by going back past WWII is making a moot point as the seasonal pattern was inverted when our economy was agrarian driven in yesteryear.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/76f3b09e4b9d8c68210bbf288762df6b/a799179fa63c7cb2-da/s500x750/209678687af2d94b939009fed911cf873cfa382f.jpg))**

> We sold $DIA & $SPY, plus other seasonal sector trades, underperforming stocks and rotated into some bond ETFs. This is the time of year we shift to a neutral stance – between our Dow/S&P Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal and our NASDAQ Best 8 Months MACD Seasonal Sell on or after June 1.

> Everyone gets hyper focused on whether you should Sell in May or not. But forget as I like to say: “Buy in October and get yourself sober.” From my October 4 Buy Signal to my April 25 Sell DIA and SPY trades were up 10.8% and 8.2% respectively. QQQ is up 15.5% from the October 4 Buy as of midafternoon trading today.

> If there is any year it’s time to get defensive in May, it’s this year. With the debt ceiling showdown, the banking crisis, inflation, interest rates and the slowing economy, it is a perfect time to move to the sidelines and enjoy the healthy yields in bonds.

*****

> # Seasonal Mid Point

> Today marks the midpoint of spring, so from here on, we can say that we're closer to summer than winter. Summer isn't typically thought of as a positive time for equities, but as highlighted in the ""Seasonality"" section of our Morning Lineup today, the next three months, which is the period straddling the back half of spring and the first half of summer, has been relatively strong in the last ten years. The table and charts below summarize the performance of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and each sector-tracking ETF from the close on May 5th through August 5th. The S&P 500's median performance during this period over the last ten years has been a gain of 5% with positive returns 90% of the time. Leading the way higher, Health Care (XLV), Real Estate (XLRE), and Technology (XLK) have all experienced median gains of over 5% with positive returns 85% of the time or more. In addition to XLV and XLK, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Consumer Staples (XLP) have also been up during this period in nine of the last ten years. On the downside, the only sector that has had a negative return on a median basis has been Energy (XLE). Ironically, even last year when the sector outperformed the broader market by a significant degree, it not only declined (-8.3%), but it also underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin during this three-month stretch.

> Looking at the last ten years, in every year since 2013, there have only been two years that the majority of sectors in the S&P 500 declined during this period (XLRE price data doesn't begin until 2016 while XLC didn't start trading until June 2018). Last year, six of eleven sectors traded lower even as the S&P 500 had a marginal gain, while in 2019, eight of eleven sectors declined as the S&P 500 fell 3%.

> # May the Fed be With You

> Happy Star Wars Day, or if you’re fan like I am (or have a birthday today like I do), May the 4th be with you!

> Of course, the title is a play on all this, but I find it apt since the Federal Reserve (Fed) looms so large as far as investors are concerned.

> The good news is that their aggressive rate hike campaign to fight inflation appears close to the end. It saw them raising rates by 5%, including the latest 0.25%-point increase they just implemented. The federal funds rate is now in the 5-5.25% range, which is the highest it got to during the mid-2000s economic expansion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-04-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

> The rate hike in May was expected, but what was more welcome was the fact that the Fed didn’t think that “additional policy firming may be appropriate”. While this is not an explicit signal that they are pausing, it did signal that they will be more data dependent. Fed Chair Powell explicitly referenced this when he talked about the future direction of policy, saying it will be assessed based on incoming data, including employment and inflation. Plus, they’ve done a lot – and they believe the economy is yet to reflect the full impact of that.

> However, as we wrote in our 2023 outlook, the big question for policy this year wasn’t how high they’ll go. Instead, the question was how long they’ll stick with high interest rates, which they view as “sufficiently restrictive” to bring inflation down to their target of 2%.

> Here we have a disconnect.

> # Markets vs the Fed
> In his post-meeting press conference, Powell was fairly clear that they remain focused on getting inflation back down to target. Inflation has moderated but remains elevated. Their forecasts don’t suggest inflation will pull back in rapid fashion, which means rate cuts would NOT be appropriate.

> On the other hand, markets are well ahead of the Fed. Investors estimate that there are no more rate hikes coming, and even beyond that, they expect the Fed to cut rates a few times before the end of the year. The chart below shows the difference between expected federal funds rate in December 2023 and June 2023. The difference right now is more than 80 basis points (0.80%), indicating at least 3 rate cuts of 0.25%-points each in the second half of 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-04-policy-rate-differential-623x800.png))**

> We wrote about this disconnect after the Fed’s prior meeting in March, but it is surprising that it hasn’t resolved yet. In fact, rate cut expectations increased after Powell’s press conference.

> You can also see how rate cut expectations surged after the SVB crisis hit, but we’ve also seen a lot of volatility in these expectations since then – as you can tell from how expectations moved after the SVB crisis hit.

> # Recession expectations
> It appears that investors are expecting a recession in the second half of the year, which will force the Fed’s hand. However, it can be useful to look to history to put current expectations in context.

> I looked at the last 3 rate cut cycles that came about amid recessions, and on average the Fed has cut rates by about 525 bps over 1.5-2 years. The table below shows the list. The 2020 recession was excluded because it was so short, both the recession and the rate cut cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-04-rate-cut-table-800x241.png))**

> One thing you can see above is that the timing of the first rate cut is 0-3 months ahead of the start of a recession.

> Markets are currently pricing the first rate cut in September 2023. Based on history, that would point to expectations for a recession starting between September and December 2023.

> Meanwhile, investors expect the federal funds rate to be about 2.9% by the end of 2024, i.e. 19 months from now. That is about 220 basis points lower than the highest rate expected this cycle, of 5.1% (where the fed funds rate is currently).

> Using a very simple calculation, and the fact that historically the Fed has cut by an average of 525 basis points, this would imply that the probability of a recession is just over 40% (220 divided by 525). In short, that is akin to rolling a 6-sided die and the odds of seeing a 5 or a 6 come up.

> That is high. However, 42% is less than 50% and that means the base case is not a recession. Obviously, this is subject to a lot of noise, and crucially, these odds can change. Just two weeks ago, the expectation was for about 170 bps of cuts by the end of 2024. That translates to a recession probability of 32%.

> The increased odds of a recession after the Fed’s latest meeting and Powell’s post-meeting comments suggests that markets think the Fed is biased toward overly restrictive policy in their quest to tame inflation. Which in turn will lead to a crisis and/or recession, forcing them to reverse course and make cuts.

> Fighting the Fed appears to be what investors are doing right now, even as the Fed tries to hold firm. So, expect bit of a bumpy ride as their views converge. And circling back to the title, may the Fed be with us all!

> # Initial and Continuing Claims in Opposite Directions

> The latest reading on initial jobless claims disappointed coming in at 242K versus expectations of 240K. That is up from last week's downward revision to 229K. As shown in the inlaid chart below, claims have moved up to some of the highest levels in a over a year with the past several weeks marking relatively range bound readings. This week's increase to 240K marks a move to the high end of that recent range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustment, claims came in at 219K. That is roughly in line with the readings of the comparable week off the year for the past few years excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were more elevated due to the pandemic. Claims are also generally following seasonal trends with the current week having consistently seen declines week over week historically. With that said, claims have yet to make a new low on the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-Claims-2.png)**

> Whereas initial claims were a slight disappointment, continuing claims surprised with an improvement this week. Rather than the increase to 1.865 million that was expected, they dropped all the way down to 1.805 million, the lowest reading in three weeks. Albeit improved in the near term, the uptrend in continuing claims remains in place as claims are around the highest levels since early 2022.

> # Sentiment Slouches

> The S&P 500 has firmly turned lower in the past few days and is nearing the lows from last Wednesday. In spite of that turn lower, bullish sentiment was unchanged at 24.1% per the latest AAII sentiment survey. Although less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish, that reading is only in the middle of the past year's range of readings as bullish sentiment has consistently been hard to come by.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-AAII-1.png))**

> With no change to bullish sentiment, all of the moves occurred for neutral and bearish sentiment. Neutral sentiment has declined for three weeks in a row, coming in at a six week low of 31% this week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-AAII-5.png))**

> All of those declines to neutral sentiment were picked up by bears as that reading rose 6.4 percentage points to 44.9%. That is the highest reading since the end of March and right in line with the average reading of bearish sentiment since the beginning of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-AAII-2.png))**

> With bearish sentiment moving higher, the bull-bear spread moved more firmly into negative territory. This week, bears outnumbered bulls by 20.8 percentage points; the widest spread in five weeks. That indicates the predominant share of respondents continue to expect the S&P 500 to head lower over the next six months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-AAII-3.png))**

> That negative outlook by individual investors is nothing new. Following the record streak of 44 straight weeks of a negative bull-bear spread that ended in February, the spread has resumed another lengthy streak of negative readings. This week marked the eleventh straight negative reading in the bull-bear spread. Even in the more recent context of the aforementioned record streak and another double-digit streak in the first quarter of last year, the AAII survey has seldom seen bears outnumber bulls on such a consistent basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/050423-AAII-4.png))**

> Factoring in other sentiment surveys like those from Investors Intelligence and NAAIM reaffirms the bearish tones of sentiment. With all three surveys combined, our sentiment composite remains firmly negative meaning sentiment is more bearish than average. We would also note that due to the timing of the collection of these surveys, they would have mostly missed any reaction to the FOMC's rate decision and market response yesterday. As such, next week's surveys will be the first to fully reflect the latest 25 bps hike and subsequent market declines.

> # The Last Hike?

> By the time most of you read this, there’s a good chance the Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%, the 10th consecutive hike from a low of 0.5% during the depths of COVID. We have no clue if this is their last hike, but odds are we are getting quite close.

> Let’s make this blog quick and easy. What if this is the last hike? Well, I went back and found the past 10 ‘last hikes’. Take note, it wasn’t until 1994 when the Fed actually announced their rate hikes for the whole world to know, so data before then isn’t always uniform. But for this, I’m using Bloomberg data.

> Looking at those 10 cycles of higher rates showed that stocks were up one year later eight times and up more than 14% on average a year later after the last hike. Yes, May 2000 is in there and we all know how poorly stocks did after that hike, but for the most part, we find it hard to justify turning wildly bearish if this is indeed the final Fed hike. There are no doubt other reasons for worry, but this might not be one of them.

> The Best Six Months November-April that begin in the Midterm is now 19-0, undefeated since 1950! These kinds of records are made to be broken, but not when it is based on such a sound and strong market seasonality.

> Now that the S&P logged a 7.7% return for the Best Six Months that just ended in April, it is time to reposition to a more neutral stance over the Worst Six Months May-October when market risk is elevated.

> Historically, the first two or three trading days of May have logged gains. That has not been the case this time around. Recent market volatility suggests a day of gains could prove challenging, especially as the market awaits the Fed’s next move tomorrow. Additional bouts of weakness often appear in May around or on the third, sixth, and twelfth trading days of the month while the last four or five trading days have generally enjoyed respectable gains on average. In pre-election years it has generally been better to lighten up on long positions early in May as the entire month tends to be weak with DJIA and S&P 500 finishing with average losses (pages 42 and 44 of Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023).NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have performed best in pre-election year Mays.

> # Why This Stock Market is Like The Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls

> “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” -Michael Jordan

> One of the big knocks we keep hearing about this bull market is that it is being led by only a few names. I was on Fox Business with Charles Payne yesterday and the guest before me was spouting off the same stats we’ve been hearing for months now. It has been widely reported that the largest two stocks in the S&P 500 (Microsoft and Apple) represent close to 40% of the rally this year and the FAANG names (Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet (formerly Google) account for about 80% of the year-to-date gains.

> Here’s what they don’t tell you, this is perfectly normal. You will always have the best stocks account for most of the gains. I compare this to the Chicago Bulls when they won six championships. Just because they had the best player of all-time, do those trophies not count the same? You want your best players to score most of the points. Steph Curry just dropped 50 in game 7 of a series and I’m pretty sure they advanced to the next round, even though he scored most of his team’s points.

> Again, your leaders are your leaders and they will count for much of the gains, but the truth is many stocks are going higher. What’s the easiest way to show that it isn’t just a few stocks that are going higher? I like to use advance-decline (A/D) lines for this purpose. An A/D line is simply a cumulative total of how many stocks went up or down each day. Throughout history, we’ve seen A/D lines break out to new highs before the indexes, while they also breakdown well ahead of actual price. This is one of the best ways to see what is really happening under the surface.

> Well, the Dow A/D line recently broke out to new highs after consolidating for more than a year. With the Dow itself about 6% away from new highs, this is a clue that the nearly 125-year-old index will probably be following the A/D line to new highs sooner than later.

> Turning to the S&P 500 A/D line we see another potentially bullish scenario. This one hasn’t quite broken out to new highs, but it is extremely close. Take note how this has trended sideways for the duration of the recent bear market, implying the tailwind for a bull market wasn’t happening. Well, should this breakout (like we expect), it very well could suggest continued strength the rest of 2023 and potentially further.

# [Stock futures are higher following third straight day of gains for the S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly higher on Thursday morning as Wall Street looked to build on a modest winning streak.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up by 98 points, or 0.32%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.23% and 0.32%, respectively. The S&P 500 on Wednesday posted its first 3-day winning streak since late May. The benchmark is on pace for its second positive week in 3 and now sits about 20% off its record high.
*****
> Chipmakers were higher in premarket trading after South Korea’s Samsung posted an 11% jump in profit and 21% surge in revenue for the latest period on strong sales of memory chips. Shares of Micron, AMD and Nvidia were all higher in premarket trading by more than 1%.
*****
> Another notable early mover was GameStop, which popped 9% in premarket trading after the video game retailer said a 4-for-1 stock split was approved by its board. Shareholders at the market close on July 18 will get a dividend of three additional shares for each of GameStop’s Class A common stock, the retailer said. The dividend will be distributed after trading closes on July 21.
*****
> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 posted its third straight day of gains following the release of the June meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve. The broader market index added nearly 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained more than 69 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite rose close to 0.4%.
*****
> Central bank officials reiterated a tough stance against inflation, saying another 50- or 75-basis point move would “likely be appropriate” at the July 26-27 meeting.
*****
> Still, many investors found it challenging to trust those gains as recession concerns continue to loom on Wall Street, and as market participants looked ahead to what many expect will be a volatile earnings season this month.
*****
> “Everybody is both emotionally and sort of market level exhausted,” Alli McCartney, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “So, I think we still have a summer of watching for what the Fed does, watching for what happens in international policy, watching for the directionality of CPI.”
*****
> On the economic front, traders will parse through the latest reports on weekly jobless claims and international trade that are due out Thursday before the bell. The Labor Department’s official jobs report is due out on Friday.
*****
> “With anecdotes of Tech sector layoffs and hiring freezes, sub-50 readings in the Employment
Components of the most recent ISM Manufacturing and Services surveys, and rising unemployment claims (albeit from extremely low levels), Friday’s Jobs report will hold particular significance,” Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub said in a note to clients.
*****
> Meanwhile, Levi Strauss is set to report earnings Thursday after the bell.

*  Specific tech embargoes from both sides, as well as

* Retaliatory trade war actions that goes beyond tech

I'm most interested in:

* Is Intel finally going to catch a break? Will they get more handouts from the government? Or will they get screwed by the Chip trade wars as well?

* Apple and Tesla's growth depend a lot on Chinese market. Is this going to hurt them?"
115,NVIDIA's Impressive Report: Not the Market's Silver Bullet,13,13rjtn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rjtn7/nvidias_impressive_report_not_the_markets_silver/,6,1685026250.0,"What's driving today's markets?

As anticipated, Wall Street's opening was a mixed bag, echoing the fluctuating futures. Shares in the real sector and banks are down, whereas technology and semiconductor manufacturers' stocks are enjoying a healthy boost. The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.

What's happening with NVIDIA?

Despite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.

In my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.

However, **I believe this growth alone won't suffice to propel the market further**. Given the challenging economic conditions, I see a high probability of a market correction on the horizon.

Let's also consider some statistical data. U.S. GDP figures surpassed expectations, yet with the unresolved debt ceiling issue, this news has taken a back seat and will likely resonate later. And as for the initial U.S. jobless claims? No change there either, meaning there’s yet more to keep an eye on in the future.

What raises concern is that the **DXY is standing at 104.21 points**, and the **ten-year UST yield is at 3.77% per annum**, with **the two-year yield at an alarming 4.42%**! Meanwhile, **gold is trending downwards**. All in all, quite an intriguing scenario."

> # Why a Strong First 100 Days Is a Good Thing

> “It’s not how you start the season, it’s how you finish.” -Albert Pujols, 11-time All Star professional baseball player

> Can you believe it, today is the 100th trading day of the year. In the face of mounting worries about the economy, Fed policy, stubborn inflation, an earnings recession, the manufacturing recession, the war in Ukraine, poor market breadth, signing Joe Burrow to a long-term NFL deal, and more, stocks have had a really strong start to 2023. Ok, that Joe Burrow part is more of a personal worry, but the man needs to be paid and we need to keep him in Bengal stripes, so it is a worry of mine in 2023.

> So, what exactly does a good start to a year as of Day 100 mean? Well, the 7.2% gain as of yesterday would be the best start to a year since 2021 with 2019 and 2017 before that. In other words, recently strong starts have meant continued gains for the bulls out there who recall those fun years.

> Looking at all the years to gain at least 7% by Day 100 showed that the rest of the year was higher by 9.4% on average and up 88.5% of the time. Anyone up for another 10% from here? Unless you are a permabear, I bet most readers would be ok with that. Lastly, the full year has never closed the year lower when up more than 7% on Day 100. Yes, 1987 is in here, so we know that stocks can indeed go lower from here, but to have a red year in 2023 would truly be rare.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-1-2-800x738.png))**

> That isn’t the only good news though. In fact, here are two more recent occurrences that should bode well for continued strong returns from stocks this year.

> First up, the S&P 500 hasn’t made a new 52-week low since the mid-October lows last year. That is more than seven months without a new low and history would say that a move right back beneath those October lows would be quite rare. As you can see from the chart below, usually this is a sign that ‘the lows’ indeed are in and in many cases strong continued gains were possible.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-2-2-800x288.png))**

> Here are all the instances of a new 52-week low and then seven months in a row without a new low. A year later? Stocks were up 12.6% on average and higher 86.4% of the time. Looking at things over the past 50 years and only twice (out of 14 times) did stocks go on to make new lows after seven months without a new 52-week low. Those were in 2002 (and the vicious three-year bubble bursting bear market) and then right ahead of a 100-year pandemic. Let’s hope now isn’t like those two and we don’t think it is. The other 12 times the lows were indeed in place. We remain in the camp that the lows from October are it and the bear market ended then. We’ve been saying that since late last year and many more are coming around to this opinion now. This study does little to change our views here.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-3-1-800x544.png))**

> Lastly, we’ve seen strong leadership from large cap technology this year, after a horrible year last year it should be noted. This is the lifeblood of bull markets, changing leadership and we have seen it this year. Turning to the NASDAQ-100, it recently made a new 52-week high for the first time since before Thanksgiving in 2021 …. Nearly 18 full months! As bad as that was, the good news is when it goes at least six months without a new 52-week high and finally makes one (like last week), the future returns can be quite strong. As we show below, the NASDAQ-100 was higher a year later 14 out of 14 times and up 16.8% on average along the way. We don’t expect this to be 14 out of 15 this time next year is all I will say.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-4-1-800x550.png))**

> With all of that, I must ask you, why are you even reading this right now? We are right before a holiday weekend and I hope you can get a break, eat some good food, and spend time with family and friends this Memorial Day weekend. The stock market is having a nice year, bonds are doing ok, or at least way better than last year, the economy is firming, the Fed is likely done hiking, and the Bengals are inching closer to signing Joey B. Have a great weekend, everyone!

> The week after Memorial Day performed quite well 1971-95. DJIA & S&P up 68% of the time, averaging 0.8% – DJIA up 12 in a row 1984-95. NAS was up 72% of the time, average 0.6%, up 10 straight 1986-95. Since 1979 R2K was up 88.2% of the time, average 0.9%, up 13 straight 1983-95.

> Starting in 1996 the week after Memorial Day performance diminished. DJIA was up only 40.7% of times, average loss 0.02%, down 9 of last 13. S&P, NAS & R2K all gained ground less than 56% of the time, down 7 of last 13. Huge gains during the week in 2000 do skew the averages.

> # Tech In Orbit

> The S&P 500 has been closing in on new 52-week highs as the index gains another 1.3% headed into the long weekend. Although the index has been moving higher, looking at relative strength lines across the S&P's eleven sectors, it would be hard to tell. Indicating what has broadly been mediocre breadth at best, the only two sectors with relative strength lines that are currently moving higher are Tech and Communication Services. The former has made a vertical move higher over the past few days in the wake of the surge in NVIDIA (NVDA), while the climb in Communication Services has been more steady. As for the other sectors, relative strength lines have been falling off a cliff for everything except Consumer Discretionary, which has been flat.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/052623-Tech-OB-1.png))**

> Again, Tech has led the way higher with a sharp move this week. The sector is now extremely overbought, trading 3.23 standard deviations above its 50-DMA; the fifth most overbought reading on record. Since 1990, there have only been a handful of times in which the S&P 500 Tech sector has traded at least 3 standard deviations overbought, with the most recent being roughly six years ago. But to find the last time the sector was as extended as it is today, you'd have to go all the way back to early 2004!

> # Government Debt Has Exploded Higher. Should We Worry?

>The fight over the debt ceiling in Washington D.C. has focused attention on the size of U.S. government debt. And it’s not pretty to look at. From the end of 2019 through the end of 2022, government debt has increased by a whopping 35% to $31.4 trillion. That translates to a dollar increase of $8.2 trillion!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-24-government-debt-603x800.png))**

> The debt-to-GDP ratio jumped from 108% before the pandemic to 120% at the end of 2022. The only solace is that it’s fallen from 135% in the second quarter of 2020 – primarily because GDP increased by $4.4 trillion since then. Note that the denominator in the ratio is “nominal” GDP, i.e. it’s not adjusted for inflation. Nominal GDP has been increasing rapidly over the past two years thanks to inflation, rising 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2022. So, one way in which debt-to-GDP can fall is with higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-24-debt-to-gdp-ratio-612x800.png))**

> The problem with inflation is that the Federal Reserve is likely to react aggressively to bring it down, which is what happened last year. They raised benchmark interest rates from near 0% to above 5% over the past 14 months to clamp down on the highest inflation in 40+ years.

> Higher interest costs for the government were a direct consequence of this. Interest payments on the federal debt have risen by $359 billion since the end of the pandemic through the first quarter of 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-24-government-interest-costs-605x800.png))**

> **But here’s the good news …**

> One thing that is weird about the debt-to-GDP ratio is that you’re comparing the “stock” of outstanding debt to GDP, which is a “flow”, i.e. the total dollar value of all finished goods and services produced within the country over a quarter.

> It’s akin to looking at your mortgage balance as a percent of your monthly or quarterly income. A better measure of financial stress, or lack thereof, is mortgage debt service costs as a percent of income.

> We can do the same thing for the government, in which case “income” is tax receipts.

> As I noted above, debt-to-GDP fell over the last couple of years because nominal GDP grew. The other side of higher nominal GDP is that tax receipts for the government have also surged. Tax receipts have risen from about $2.2 trillion at the end of 2019 to $3.2 trillion by the end of 2022, an increase of $1 trillion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-24-government-tax-receipts-608x800.png))**

> This is the other side of government spending that kept the economy afloat in 2020-2021. Stimulus checks, PPP loans, and expanded unemployment benefits ensured that consumer spending held strong – the downside was higher inflation, as the pandemic shut down a lot of supply even as demand recovered immediately. Nevertheless, one person’s spending is another person’s income, and income is taxed.

> The other reason tax receipts surged, especially in 2021, was an increase in capital gains receipts thanks to rising asset prices. This was less so in 2022. However, 4.8 million more people gained jobs in 2022, which helped push tax receipts higher.

> The chart below shows government interest costs as a percent of tax receipts, and right now it’s just under 27%. It’s gone almost straight up over the last few quarters but remains slightly below where it was in 2019, which was right along the historical average of 27.3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-24-government-interest-costs-tax-receipts-610x800.png))**

> Things don’t look too concerning when you look at the chart above. Ultimately, if the economy is growing, the debt-to-GDP ratio should remain stable (or fall), and tax receipts will continue to rise.

> Recession is a real concern because that’s when tax receipts fall amid a rise in unemployment. This is why the ratio between interest costs and tax receipts jumped to over 50% in the early-to-mid 1980’s. Fed Chair Paul Volcker had raised interest rates sharply to combat high inflation, which resulted in:

> * Higher interest costs on the federal debt

> * A recession, which meant there were fewer tax receipts as spending and employment fell

> Right now, we don’t believe we’re in a similar situation, and our base case is that the U.S. can avoid a recession this year.

*****

> # Two More Bullish Pieces of Evidence

> “No amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot.” -Mark Twain

> We been pointing out signs of an early cycle revival in the economy and many bullish signals that indeed suggest the upward trend in stocks since October is alive and well. Well, here’s a blog on two more things that recently triggered and both could be nice signs for both the economy and stocks going forward.

> First up, this past earnings season was really good relative to expectations. According to Factset, about 95% of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings and a very impressive 78% beat expectations. Yes, earnings are set to come in down 2.2% versus the first quarter last year, but this is much better than the 6.6% drop that was expected this time seven weeks ago. Also, all 11 sectors came in better than expected, with tech (the largest component) really impressing. Lastly, the average company beat earnings by 6.5%, one of the best beats in years, while the average small cap stock beat by an even wider margin.

> Thanks to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, MSCI U.S. trailing 12-month earnings have officially bottomed and are now heading higher. Given nearly 80% issued increased revisions (the left side of the chart below), this makes sense that this would stop going down and start going up. All in all, this is a very strong signal that all the worries about the impending recession have been greatly exaggerated and corporate America likely sees better times coming.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-1-1-800x675.png))**

> The other thing that no one is pointing out is the S&P 500’s 200-day moving average has officially turned higher. This is a longer-term trendline and it tends to catch significant trends. Right now, it’s rebounding off a bottom and that is another feather in the cap for bulls.

> Some previous times the 200-day turned higher after trending lower for an extended period were July 2016, August 2009, June 2003, and March 1991. For those who remember their stock market history, all of those times indeed took place after significant lows were already formed (in other words, no new lows took place) and continued strong gains occurred. I eyeballed 10 times this turned higher and all 10 were nice times to own stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-2-1-800x426.png))**

> Our friends at Bespoke looked at this and they found 20 times the 200-day moving average made a new 52-week low and then moved at least 1% off that level within three months, so a clear signal that the lower trend in stocks had ended. Sure enough, going back to 1928, they found the S&P 500 was higher a year later 20 out of 20 times, with a solid average gain of 18.2%. 20 out of 20!

> One thing I’ve seen the past few months though is many of the perma-bears have really dug their heels in, likely costing many investors a good deal of gains and future gains. Take another look at the Mark Twain quote at the beginning. We’ve been sharing a lot of evidenced-based investment data this year showing better times could be coming and fortunately, it has been taking place for investors. The vast majority of what we see continues to look quite positive and we expect more solid gains from stocks the rest of this year, with an economy that will avoid a recession and surprise to the upside.

> # Copper Under the Weather

> Earlier Monday in our Morning Lineup post, we highlighted the recent short-term weakness in gold just days after it hit all-time highs. While the declines are disheartening for gold bulls, they can take comfort in the fact that at least gold has been doing better than copper.

> Copper prices rallied in the second half of 2022, but that rally stalled out in early January at just over $4.30 per pound, below its highs from last May. Since then, prices have experienced little in the way of positive momentum, falling below both the 50-DMA and 200-DMA. Copper is now down over 15% from its YTD high, and it's testing the bottom of its longer-term uptrend channel.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/052223-Gold-One-Year.png))**

> On a five-year basis, you can see again how copper prices are currently testing a long-term uptrend after carving out a downtrend that has been shorter-term in length.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/05/052223-Copper-5-Year.png))**

> A look at the relative strength of copper is where the relationship between the two commodities really gets interesting. From May 2018 through May 2020, copper prices consistently underperformed gold, and this was a period that included what was a US manufacturing slowdown ahead of what became a full-blown economic shutdown during COVID. As governments and central banks flooded the economy with stimulus, the roles of copper and gold completely reversed, and in the span of under a year erased two years of underperformance. Then, from late February 2021 through June 2022, the two commodities performed roughly in line with each other as there was little movement in the relative strength of the two commodities.

> In the first half of 2022 as the FOMC started ratcheting up the rate hikes, copper started to lose ground versus gold, and just in the last few weeks, copper’s relative strength has dropped to its lowest level since the start of 2021! If copper’s performance is a sign of the strength or weakness in the global economy, someone better start heating up the chicken soup.

# **S&P 500 rises on Friday to close out big first half, Nasdaq posts best start to a year in 4 decades: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
*****
> Stocks rose Friday and technology names continued their staggering run to cap off a strong start to the year, and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 285.18 points, or 0.84%, to close at 34,407.60. The S&P 500 climbed 1.23% to end at 4,450.38, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.45% to settle at 13,787.92.
*****
> Mega-cap technology stocks responsible for a sizeable chunk of 2023′s market gains rose Friday. Dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.6%, bringing its yearly gains to more than 189%. Netflix added about 2.9%, while Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon rose 1.9%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Apple gained 2.3% to close above a $3 trillion market cap.
*****
> Elsewhere, Nike shares bucked the broad market uptrend. The apparel giant fell 2.7% after reporting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.
*****
> Friday marked a pivotal day for investors, bringing the conclusion of the month, second quarter and first half. The last six months saw 2022′s beaten-down growth names make a broad comeback as the promise of artificial intelligence and hope of an end to the Federal Reserve’s rate campaign lifted major tech players to astonishing heights.
*****
> Despite these strong gains, some on Wall Street expect volatility in the second half and likely profit taking from investors that benefited from the rally. This, coupled with changing technicals, could lead to sideways action, or a slight pullback in the S&P, said Anna Han, equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.
*****
> “The technicals are telling us that this ubercap-led rally has just been overextended,” she said. “It’s been hitting those overbought levels, and we believe it’s time for that trade to kind of take a pause.”
*****
> This is where the major averages stand:
*****
> * For June: The S&P 500 gained 6.5% for its best monthly performance since October. The Nasdaq advanced 6.6%. Both indexes notched a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow climbed 4.6%, for its best month since November.
> * For the second quarter: The S&P 500 rose 8.3%, on track for a third straight quarter of gains and its biggest quarterly advance since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq jumped 12.8% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow added 3.4% for a third winning quarter.
> * For year to date and the first half: The S&P 500 has popped 15.9% for its best first half since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow added a modest gain of 3.8%.
The three major averages also notched winning weeks, gaining more than 2% each.

*****
> Wall Street also got another hint of encouraging inflation news as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched gauge by the Federal Reserve, rose less than expected in May.
*****
> “This is excellent news on the inflation fight,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. “If you don’t believe disinflation is happening, you aren’t paying attention. The Fed was right to pause and needs to hold firm at these levels to prevent overcorrecting and causing an unnecessary recession to fight a beast that is now under control.”

> # First Trading Day of July – S&P 500 Up 12 Straight

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ffbcd50de3d1daa859f383b45f9e2428/1327512fd24c5fb2-b2/s500x750/2e57e0999be12e26959385cf4b4c8089a06328c3.jpg))**

> Over the past 21 years from 2002-2022 July’s first trading has the second-best record up 85.7% of the time on the S&P 500 with an average gain of 0.35%. Only August’s third to last trading day has a better record up 19 of 21 with an average gain of 0.57%.

> DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.31%. NASDAQ splits the middle up 81.0% (0.31% average gain) of the time. July’s first trading day is the third best performing first trading day of all twelve months based upon DJIA points gained with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1668.15 points since 1998.

> Looking back even further to 1989, S&P 500 has advanced 88.2% of the time (up 30 times in 34 years) with an average gain of 0.50%. DJIA has advanced 28 times in the same 34 years (82.4%) and NASDAQ has risen in 26 of those years (76.5%) with an average advance of 0.34% in all years. No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength, which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 34 years.

> # This is a Big Deal: Business Investment is Rising Again

> We’ve been getting a string of “economic surprises” from the consumer side for several months now. Employment data is a prime example, with monthly payroll gains coming in above expectations for 14 straight months. For a change, we just got some good news from the business side, particularly business investment.

> The Census Bureau collects data on manufacturers’ shipments and new orders for durable goods – big ticket items like transportation equipment (including vehicles and aircrafts), machinery, computers and electronic products, electrical equipment, and appliances, etc. New orders are particularly useful because it tells us how businesses are viewing current and future economic conditions and investing accordingly. It also tells us about future production commitments for manufacturers.

> Well, new orders rose 1.7% in May, even as economists expected orders to decline almost 1%! New orders are now up 5.4% since last year, and this pace is higher than what we saw at any point in 2019.

> A large part of this is because of nondefense aircraft orders, which surged 32% in May, and a whopping 61% over the past year. This is huge for America’s aircraft industry – the recent uptrend stands in sharp contrast to what we saw in 2018-2019 when aircraft orders were declining amid Boeing’s 737-Max woes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-aircrafts-800x633.png))**

> However, as you can see above, aircraft orders are really volatile. It helps to strip them out, along with new orders from the defense industry (which can also be quite volatile).

> What’s left is a key economic datapoint – a category called nondefense capital goods ex aircraft, which is really a proxy for business investment, or capital expenditures (“capex”). This rose 0.7% in May, yet another datapoint that beat forecasts (expectations were for a 0.1% increase). New orders for these “core capital goods” are now up 2.1% from last year and rising at a 3.2% annualized pace over the first 5 months of this year.

> Now, this data is nominal, in that it’s not adjusted for prices. And we’ve had a lot of inflation over the past year and a half. But even after you adjust for inflation, this proxy for business investment rose 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% increase in April. Investment in real terms has been falling since the beginning of 2022, and so the 0.8% uptick over the past two months is very welcome.

> Here’s something a lot of people don’t talk about when they compare today’s economy to the pre-pandemic economy, which is widely recognized as strong: business investment collapsed in 2019, amid a lot of uncertainty around the trade war, and escalating tariffs. Hopefully, the recent uptick not only reverses the downtrend from last year, but also the pre-pandemic downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-new-orders-core-capital-goods-598x800.png))**

> We do recognize that two months do not make a trend. But other data also corroborate the fact that businesses are investing again.

> **Something big is happening in America**

> Nonresidential construction is booming, mostly thanks to manufacturing construction. I discussed what was happening a few months ago, but there has been no slowdown in the data since then. Even after adjusting for inflation, manufacturing construction is up 84% over the past year through April. Most of this is being driven by a 233% increase in construction in the computers, electronics, and electricals sector, i.e. semiconductor and electrical vehicle battery plants.

> The chart below shows how manufacturing construction was stagnant across most of the past decade, but it seems to have broken out now. There was an inflection point last summer after Congress passed the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (which had less to do with inflation and more to do with promoting investment via subsidies and tax credits). Also interesting, this is a phenomenon that is happening only in the US – other developed countries like Germany, Japan, UK, and Australia are not seeing a similar surge.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-manufacturing-construction-601x800.png))**

> Finally, if you look at just S&P 500 companies, capital expenditure expectations over the next 12 months have been rising consistently this year. Forward-looking capex expectations are up almost 4% over the first six months of this year, and up 7% compared to a year ago.

> This is not something that would be happening amid a slowdown, let alone a recession. The chart below shows how capex expectations were stagnant in 2019 amid higher uncertainty. That’s not the case today, even amid all the recession forecasts.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-29-SP500-forward-capex-800x619.png))**

> Business sentiment has been quite poor, perhaps because of all the headline-grabbing recession forecasts. However, the hard data suggests that businesses are investing and looking to expand capacity – a sign that they view future economic conditions positively when it comes to putting money to work.

> # There's Something About June 29th

> There must be something about June 29th. Besides being a significant day of the year from a seasonal perspective (as discussed in Wednesday's Chart of the Day), two crucial events related to some of the most significant business stories of the past two decades took place on this day, two years apart. The first involved Bernie Madoff, who infamously orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, although it is worth noting that Madoff once described the Federal Government as another Ponzi scheme, so by his logic, he would have only overseen the second largest Ponzi scheme ever. On this day in 2009, Madoff, once a highly respected and well-loved figure on Wall Street, stood alone in a Manhattan courtroom, devoid of any familial or friendly support, and received a sentence of 150 years in prison.

> On a much brighter note, two years earlier in 2007, Apple fans lined up and, in some cases, camped outside of stores for days to be among the first to get their hands on the first-generation iPhone. The fact that people were willing to pay over $500 for a heretofore unproven smartphone should have been all we needed to see to know that this was going to usher in a revolution in the entire computing industry.

> Given the success of the iPhone and the scandal of Madoff, you would think that the launch of the iPhone would have been a positive market event and the Madoff sentencing would be associated with a negative market environment. As the chart below illustrates, though, the exact opposite was the case. The first iPhones didn’t just go on sale within four months of any ordinary market peak; the formal launch preceded a 56%+ peak-to-trough drop in the S&P 500 that was the largest drawdowns since the Great Depression. Conversely, Madoff’s sentencing came less than four months after that same largest drawdown since the Great Depression ended.

> We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, but investing based on the headlines can be one of the worst investment strategies known to man.

> # July Historically Opens Strong, But Fades After Mid-Month

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/dc2d0ec1b1feca14027b1079c4265f04/4da4ae35f1413c04-f3/s500x750/dacadbe1082ae3c1c3d7ca9a1ae13701b64aca8a.jpg))**

> July is the third month of DJIA’s and S&P 500’s “Worst Six Months” and the first month of NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months.” Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. But by around mid-month, inflows have faded and the market’s performance in July usually peaks. This tends to create a strong open and first half. In all the years examined the major indexes tend to reach a peak around mid-month and then drift sideways to slightly lower for the remainder of the month. In pre-election years since 1950, the mid-month peak and second half declines have more pronounced especially for NASDAQ and Russell 2000.

> # Tech Selloff Sets Up NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/404c7ff927b906208e884b76137c85c7/827015a9b340641c-68/s500x750/cbba45e864f792bd2ccb1bedd46b17ebc561f760.jpg))**

> The week after June Triple Witching delivered its expected weakness, but this sets up NASDAQ’s 12-day midyear rally to a T.

> In the mid-1980s tech’s influence in the market began to grow and the market’s focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 38 years with an average historical gain of 2.4%. Look for this rally to begin around June 28 and run until about July 14.

> After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ’s mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last thirteen years, up eleven times with two losses. Last year, NASDAQ faltered during the 12-day span, but eventually took off in the second half of July, up 12.3%.

> Our strategy is to buy the close on Tuesday June 27 and sell July 14 or take profits on any sizable gain in between.

*****

> # DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ historically cooler in pre-election year Julys

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ca5fdb98c2d927ebcb80de754a93067/279ecd4a9c258a7f-76/s500x750/b0e1de7b68ed5c448a0ebd8602cd9073334c2e2a.jpg))**

> July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter, however the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. “Hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&P 500 both gained greater than 6% combined with strong performances in 2013, 2018, and 2022 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.3% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/85102b97863f6c9f07b63c7af59848ad/279ecd4a9c258a7f-ea/s500x750/559380e2c01eacc909f8c0d54ffbb5882a7cbbff.jpg))**

> Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #7 for DJIA and S&P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #9. NASDAQ has advanced in seven of the last thirteen pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and an awesome holiday shortened trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"
122,When is it better to hold equal-weighted S&P ETF?,8,13ykrlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ykrlh/when_is_it_better_to_hold_equalweighted_sp_etf/,16,1685730893.0,"
I have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:

* Nvidia's advancements is going to ""democratize AI"" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.

* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.

* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.

Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well."
123,"Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail",11,x0qvkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x0qvkz/leveraging_money_flow_cyclicals_computer_software/,3,1661785084.0,"Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil & Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil & Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil & gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil & gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount & Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

**Alternative and Solar Energy**

We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy (ENPH) still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only -3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.

124,After-hours trading: Nvidia leads chip stocks higher on Meta plan's tech frenzy,7,yefki0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yefki0/afterhours_trading_nvidia_leads_chip_stocks/,12,1666836229.0,"(Bloomberg) -- Buried in a gloomy earnings report from Meta Platforms Inc. was a bit of good news -- just not for the Facebook parent company.

&#x200B;

The shares of companies that supply data centers gained after Meta Platforms said it’s planning to spend even more on components next year as it invests in infrastructure to support its push into digitally immersive experiences.

In its third quarter earnings report, Meta Platforms projected capital spending of $34 billion to $39 billion in 2023, up from $30 billion to $34 billion this year. The comments sent Nvidia Corp. and Marvell Technology Inc. up more than 3% in postmarket trading.

&#x200B;

Arista Networks Inc., which makes networking gear used in data centers and counts Meta as one of its biggest customers, is up more than 7%.

&#x200B;

“Amidst increased question/concern that Meta would significantly reduce their forward capex guide in conjunction with third quarter results, tonight we got the absolute opposite,” Wells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers said in a report.

&#x200B;

While Meta’s spending plans are a boon to its suppliers, it was received poorly by investors skeptical of the high costs associated with its strategic shift. The stock dropped 14% after the company projected weaker-than-expected sales in the current quarter."

*****
> Stock futures fell slightly on Friday morning as investors looked to close out a winning week for markets that saw better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in market-darling Tesla.
*****
> S&P 500 futures shed 0.28%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat.
*****
> Earnings season continued, with Intel slumped more than 9% premarket following a dismal earnings report that missed on the top and bottom lines. Strong guidance boosted American Express despite a top-and bottom-line miss.
*****
> Stocks rose during regular trading Thursday, cheering a better-than-expected fourth quarter gross domestic product report that stoked hopes that the U.S. economy can experience a soft landing as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame inflation.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 205 points, or 0.61%, notching its fifth consecutive winning session, the first streak of that length since October. The S&P 500 rose 1.10% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.76%.
*****
> All three indexes are positive for the week and month. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.7% and 2.2% this week, respectively. The Nasdaq is up 3.3% on the week and is set to notch its best monthly performance since July. The Nasdaq has gained the last four weeks.
*****
> “This year’s stock market rally is impressive and shouldn’t be ignored,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliancesaid in a Thursday note. ”Unfortunately, the Fed is likely to start talking down the market again, as early as next week, so prepare for volatility again this year; we may be in the eye of the hurricane and not completely out of the woods yet.”
*****
> Tesla closed out Thursday with an 11% gain after earnings and revenue for the last quarter topped expectations and CEO Elon Musk projected the carmaker could possibly produce 2 million cars this year. The widely followed stock was down 65% last year to lead a rout in the growth sector. The shares are up more than 30% this year.
*****
> On Friday, investors will be watching for economic reports that will give more information about the state of inflation. Personal income and spending and pending home sales for December are due in the morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a preferred inflation measurement for the Federal Reserve, is also due. Consumer sentiment for January will also be released.
*****
> It’s some of the last data that will be released ahead of the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Feb. 1. Investors are currently expecting a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike from the central bank.

*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday, notching its best month since January.
*****
> The blue-chip index closed 272 points, or 0.8%, higher at 34,098.16. The S&P 500 added 0.83% to finish at 4,169.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% to end at 12,226.58 as investors parsed the latest crop of technology earnings.
*****
> The Dow finished April 2.5% higher, its best monthly showing since January, when the average ended up 2.8%. The S&P 500 logged a 1.5% monthly gain — its second positive month in a row — while the Nasdaq ended the month only slightly higher.
*****
> On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq saw the largest gain, at 1.3%, in what was considered Big Tech’s marquee earnings week. The Dow and S&P 500 each finished the week about 0.9% higher.
*****
> Just over half of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings thus far. Of those companies, 80% have beaten expectations, according to data from FactSet. That beat rate is roughly in line with a three-year average, according to data from The Earnings Scout.
*****
> “The market should follow earnings,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management. “That is the mother’s milk of the market.”
*****
> Amazon shares closed down nearly 4%. When reporting first-quarter results, the online retailer said its cloud business decelerated, though it did beat Wall Street’s expectations for revenue in the quarter.
*****
> Snap tumbled 17% following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares dropped 15.7% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations. First Solar slid more than 9% after missing Wall Street expectations for the first quarter.
*****
> Not every tech stock was down following their respective releases. Intel shares climbed 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.
*****
> Data released Friday morning showed the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3% in March, which was in line with economist expectations. The index is a key gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting scheduled for next week.
*****
> “Today is reflective of sort of a three-legged stool,” said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. “Earnings, economic data and the Fed continue to be the investor narrative.”
*****
> Also of note, shares of troubled First Republic Bank plunged more than 43% after CNBC’s David Faber reported that the most likely outcome for the regional bank is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking receivership. The stock has lost more than 97% of its value since the start of the year.

> # Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sell In May

> Buckle up, as one of the most well-known investment axioms is nearly here, the ‘Sell in May and Go Away’ period, otherwise known as Sell in May. This gets a ton of play in the media, as these six months are indeed the worst six-month combo out of all scenarios, while stocks also did quite poorly last year during this timeframe as well, only adding to the likely hype.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog1A-800x450.png))**

> The thinking is you are better off to simply ignore these six months and go away. Turns out, from May through October the S&P 500 is historically quite weak, up only 1.7% on average and higher less than 65% of the time, making it indeed the worst combo.

> Of course, 1.7% is still a positive return, so maybe we shouldn’t just blindly go away? That is our take and there are other reasons not to fear these worst six months in 2023. Sure, more volatility and scary headlines could happen, but with overall market sentiment extremely bearish and the economy on firmer footing than most think, we’d use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.

> Here’s something I bet most investors don’t know, May has been really strong lately for stocks, higher an incredible nine of the past 10 years. Maybe we should call it Sell in June?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-2-1-800x569.png))**

> Let’s take a closer look at that one year over the past decade that stocks fell in May. Turns out, one potential hiccup is May is the second worst month of the year for stocks during a pre-election year, with only September worse. In fact, these are the only two months with a negative return during a pre-election year, with May down 0.1% and September down 0.7%. Even in the bullish 2019 (when stocks gained close to 30%), stocks still lost more than 6% in May of that year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-3-1-800x338.png))**

> Last year was a great time to sell and go away during these historically weak six months, but that wasn’t always the case. In fact, over the past decade, stocks only fell twice these six months, last year and 2015. Looking at the past decade shows that these six months have been up nearly 5% on average versus the 1.7% return going back to 1950.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-4-800x449.png))**

> We’ve noted many times the past several months how historically strong pre-election years were for stocks, well, what about Sell in May in a pre-election year? As you can see below, the returns are right about average, up 1.8% during these six months in a pre-election year. What stands out more to me is how poorly these six months are during a midterm year, playing out well last year for sure.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-5-800x342.png))**

> Now here’s where things get quite interesting. It turns out how things are going heading into these six months can often give a clue what might happen. When stocks are down year-to-date heading into these six months the return drops to 2.3% and is higher less than a coinflip of the time. Given this was the scenario last year, along with a midterm year, maybe a rough time wasn’t such a surprise? Now the good news is when stocks are up for the year (like 2023), these worst six months actually gained more than 4% on average and were higher more than 75% of the time. This could bode well for potentially better returns these six months in 2023.

DJIA and S&P 500 shed over 2.5% while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 dropped over 3%.

> # ""Big"" Winners

> Whenever you see a list of best-performing stocks, it’s inevitably loaded with many small stocks that most investors have never heard of. This year, though, it’s practically been the opposite trend as the two top performing stocks in the S&P 500 on a YTD basis – Meta Platforms (+96%) and Nvidia (+88%)- are not only household names but they also have market caps of more than $500 billion. We’d also note that both stocks are also more than 30 percentage points ahead of the next closest stocks in terms of top YTD returns.

> With such strong returns among the largest stocks in the S&P 500, the YTD performance spread between the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 and its equal-weighted counterpart is among the widest ever seen on a YTD basis through the end of April. Through Friday afternoon, the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 was up 8.26% while the equal-weighted index was up just 2.13%. At 6.14 percentage points, the YTD performance gap between the two indices is the second widest since 1990 trailing only the 6.8% percentage point gap in 2020. Besides 2020, the only other year where the gap was wider than two percentage points was in 1997. While it’s a small sample size and history doesn’t always repeat itself, we’d note that the S&P 500’s rest-of-year performance was a gain of over 20% in both of those years. Just saying.

> Besides the two other years where the performance gap was significantly wide like this year, what stands out about the chart below is how common it has historically been for the market cap-weighted index to underperform the equal weight index in the first four months of the year. Including this year, the cap-weighted index has only outperformed nine times in the last 34 years.

> # 10 Weeks of Bearish Sentiment

> As the S&P 500 broke down to the lowest levels of April this week, bullish sentiment according to the weekly AAII survey came in at a new short-term low. After rising to 27.2% last week, only 24.1% of respondents reported as bullish this week, the lowest reading since the end of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042723-AAII-1.png))**

> That resulted in rising bearish sentiment which rose 3.4 percentage points to 38.5%. Conversely, to bullish sentiment, that is the highest reading since the end of March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042723-AAII-2.png)**

> With inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread has fallen deeper into negative territory meaning bears continue to outnumber bulls, and by a wider margin, although nowhere near the degree as levels seen in 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042723-AAII-3.png))**

> As we noted throughout 2022 and earlier this year, bears have consistently outnumbered bulls. In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row in which the bull-bear spread was negative. While that is one of only a handful of other streaks lasting for ten or more weeks going back through the history of the survey, it comes on the back of the record 44-week streak that ended this past February. That was only shortly after another 12-week streak ending in March of last year and the second longest streak on record (34 weeks long) that ended in the fall of 2020. In other words, the story remains in which sentiment has been unshakably bearish.

*****

> # Some Improvement in Claims

> The latest week's jobless claims data fell down to 230K from the previous week's upward revision to 246K. That 16K decline was the largest week over week drop since the first week of the month and brings claims back down to the low end of the past couple of months' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042723-Claims-1.png))**

> Before seasonal adjustment, claims were lower reaching 225.84K. That is roughly inline with the comparable weeks of last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, a drop in the current week of the year has very much been the norm historically. As for 2023 as a whole, unadjusted claims have remained relatively flat following the steep seasonal decline in the first weeks of the year. The potential for further seasonal strength will remain in place for the next few weeks as claims historically have reached a seasonal low in late May.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042723-Claims-2.png))**

> Like initial claims, seasonally adjusted continuing claims also surprised with a decline this week. Continuing claims totaled 1.858 million in the most recent week, down from 1.865 million and better than the expected increase to 1.87 million. Albeit the latest week's reading was surprisingly strong, the indicator's uptrend remains firmly in place which as we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, the overall rise in continuing claims has resembled other recessionary periods.

> # S&P 500 April Loss Historically Bearish for Rest of Year

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/565099125e6aba70c4554702b784a187/5996998b1086db68-df/s540x810/2a1c714fae726303abb1815a2d0d6c4eca9b011f.jpg))**

> April has been the second-best performing S&P 500 month since 1950 based upon average percent gain. As of today’s close, S&P 500 is down 1.3% this April. Should S&P 500 close out April in the red, the outlook for the balance of the year diminishes notably. In the included table all S&P 500 down Aprils since 1950 appear. Performance in May, during the “Worst Six Months” (May to October), the rest of the year, and the full year is also included.

> When comparing S&P 500 down Aprils to all Aprils and positive Aprils there historically has been a sizable reduction in average performance and frequency of gains following a down April. Average performance for the rest of the year after a down April was a loss of 0.49% compared to a gain of 7.30% after an up April and 5.06% after all Aprils. Full year S&P 500 performance also dropped significantly following a down April, –1.36% versus 13.31% in years with a positive April. But, with two trading days left, there is still a chance S&P 500 avoids an April loss.

*****

> # May Almanac: Second Worst S&P 500 Month in Pre-Election Years

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up fourteen times in the past twenty-five years (four of the years had gains exceeding 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down –11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains of 2.5% or better and seven losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another substantial loss of 7.9% in 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8e66df75558349457d67607457242969/8933569af25cc0af-dd/s500x750/fa9a24d982799356a3df4d0b6825c334b5bc60fe.jpg))**

> Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #8 Russell 1000 and #7 Russell 2000. Historically bullish pre-election forces do not consistently lift May. Four of the nine S&P 500 pre-election year May declines exceeded 4%, the worst was a 6.6% loss in 2019. Russell 2000 gained 10.6% in May 2003, notably boosting its average gain and ranking.

# [Stock futures rise Thursday after S&P 500 posts 4-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/22/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Thursday as traders weigh earnings from chipmaker Nvidia and assess future potential Federal Reserve moves.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 105 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%.
*****
> Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue.
*****
> The S&P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain.
*****
> The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes.
*****
> Inflation “remained well above” the Fed’s 2% target and the labor market “remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,” according to the minutes.
*****
> “The Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn’t get entrenched at its current high level,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “By mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.”
*****
> More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John’s, Wayfair and Bath & Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others.

> # 7 Questions About Regional Banks

> There are so many questions that we get from our advisors and clients about the regional banking crisis, in addition to the debt ceiling (which Ryan covered in another blog). Here’re some answers to some of the common questions.

> # What is happening with regional banks?
> The crisis erupted with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in early March. SVB hit the end of the road with a classic run on the bank, i.e. depositors rushing out the door, even as the bank’s asset values had deteriorated due to long-term bond holdings that lost value as interest rates surged over the past year. The FDIC eventually took over the insolvent bank, along with Signature Bank and First Republic (in late April). So regional banks have been under pressure over the past 2 months, as investors extrapolated some of the problems that plagued the three troubled banks to others.

> Then last week saw renewed selling pressure on regional bank stocks. On May 4th, PacWest Bancorp fell 51.6% and Western Alliance Bancorp fell 41%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 7.2% just on that day. Now, as you can see in the chart below, there’s been quite a recovery since then, but prices are still down significantly since the crisis started. The KRE ETF is down almost 34.6% since March 8th, when the crisis started.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-regional-bank-stock-prices-800x413.png))**

> # Why are small bank stock prices still under pressure?
It helps to understand how a bank works. They make money by borrowing money from depositors (yes, when you put money in a bank, you’re lending money to it) and lending money to consumers and businesses. The difference between the interest rate they charge borrowers and the rate they pay depositors is their “net interest margin” (NIM), or profit. Right now, the fear is that profitability has reduced as banks, especially smaller ones, have to increase the rates they pay depositors to keep them from fleeing. However, what’s important to know is that reduced profitability is different from insolvency, which is what happened to the 3 banks that went under.

> # What’s different from SVB and some of these other regional banks?
The main problem for SVB was that more than 90% of their deposits were uninsured. When news spread that their assets were impaired, and they were looking to raise capital, these depositors fled as they were worried that they wouldn’t get their money back. We wrote about it in depth at the time.

> In contrast, banks like PacWest and Western Alliance have a much smaller percent of deposits that are uninsured (about 25%) – making them potentially less prone to a run.

> # So why did the stock prices for these banks crash on May 4th?
As I wrote above, there doesn’t appear to be any fundamental solvency issues with these banks, other than perhaps reduced profitability. Instead, what happened last week was driven by stock market speculation. Case in point, short selling and put option activity on PacWest and Western Alliance surged recently. Put options allow investors to profit from lower stock prices. In this case, market makers and dealers who sold these positions were “long” stocks and had to hedge that by shorting. This pushed prices lower, and eventually led to dealers having to sell even more shares short, especially as investors bought even more puts.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-banks-put-option-buying-800x503.png))**

> # Wait, is this something like the meme stock frenzy?
> In a sense, yes. If you remember, back in early 2021 stock prices for meme stocks surged on speculative activity, particularly call option buying. Dealers who sold these options were essentially “short” the stock. So, they had to hedge to be directionally neutral, which they did by buying stock, pushing prices higher. And as the social media frenzy picked up, prices surged as dealers had to buy even more stock.

> I made the following schematic to illustrate what happened with regional banks last week. Now historically bank runs have been triggered by news events, and that can potentially happen a lot quicker these days because of social media. Speculators were betting that the bank in trouble will see deposits flee, and eventually be taken over by the FDIC, an event that would wipe out shareholders and result in profits for investors betting on these bank stock prices crashing. The good news is that the negative feedback loop was broken pretty quickly.

> # Could this be the canary in the coalmine, and can the crisis spread?
> Never say never in the investment business. But one big sign that trouble is not spreading is that banks are not accessing the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) liquidity facilities to the extent they were a few weeks ago. Loans to banks via the Fed’s facilities are at the lowest level in 7 weeks. There are three pieces here:
> * Lending to FDIC depository institutions (yellow bar in the chart below) – These are loans extended to banks that were subsequently taken over by the FDIC, like SVB, Signature and First Republic. This increased in the latest data because First Republic was just taken over.
> * Discount window (dark blue bars) – Banks can use this to access liquidity in exchange for collateral (like US treasuries). It’s fallen from $153 billion to $5 billion over the last month, which is close to where it was before the SVB crisis.
> * Bank term funding program (green bar) – This is a new facility that the Fed set up in March after the SVB crisis. Banks can access liquidity here by exchanging securities at their full par value. This has dropped from a peak of $81 billion to $76 billion, which is a very positive sign.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-fed-facilities-usage-600x800.png))**

> Another positive sign: the latest data from the Fed shows that deposits at small commercial banks in the US have stabilized over the past month. Deposits at these banks cratered over the two weeks after the SVB crisis, and the worry was that this would continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-small-bank-deposits.png))**

> # Will there be a broader economic impact, due to a credit crunch?
> The latest Fed survey of loan officers from showed that banks tightened credit at the start of the second quarter. However, the net percent of survey respondents saying they tightened standards for commercial and industrial loans did not increase significantly, rising from 44.8% in January to 46% in April. But here’s the other side of that: 54% said that standards “remained basically unchanged”.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-sloos-CI-loan-standards-net-tightening.png))**

> Make no mistake, credit standards have tightened over the past year. But that was already the case before the SVB crisis, and it really hasn’t had much of an impact on the economy as we saw from the recent GDP growth data for Q1.

> Note that banks are still making loans. In fact, bank lending is up 8.5% over the past year – it was running at a pace of around 5% before the pandemic. Now a big part of that is due to inflation, as higher prices mean loans are larger. But bank lending doesn’t look to have completely collapsed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-2023-05-11-bank-credit.png))**

> Ultimately, what is important with respect to the current economic expansion (since 2020) is that this is NOT a credit driven cycle. This contrasts with the late 1980s, late 1990s and mid-2000s. During those periods, credit growth drove business and real estate investment, and consumer spending. Eventually, when losses on loans spread, credit was pulled back and the economy went into a recession.

> Right now, economic growth is being driven by strong incomes, because of strong employment and wage growth. And so far, there’s no reason to believe that will not continue.

Over the last 28 years on the Friday before Mother’s Day Dow has gained ground 19 times. On Monday after, DJIA has advanced 17 times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.26% and 0.23% on Monday. However, Monday following Mother’s Day has been down 8 of the last 11 years. In 2019, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother’s Day loss going back to 1995, off 2.38%.

> # 11 Things To Know About The Debt Ceiling

> “I don’t make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.”

> – Will Rogers

> One of the top questions we’ve received lately has to do with the impending debt ceiling drama and what it could all mean. Here are some common questions and answers regarding this excitement out of Washington.

> * What is the debt ceiling? Simply put, it is how much money our country has to pay the bills, authorized by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Treasury. This is one of those weird ways in which government functions. Congress typically authorizes spending bills, which the President signs into law. Historically, this spending has exceeded government revenues, and Treasury issues debt to cover the deficit. However, there is a “ceiling” to how much total debt Treasury can incur. Congress typically has to pass a second bill authorizing the ceiling to move higher, so that Treasury can pay for spending that was already passed into law. Not raising the debt ceiling is akin to going to a restaurant, ordering and eating the food, and then walking out without paying the bill.

> * What is paid from this? Medicare and Social Security are two of the big ones. But tax refunds, military salaries and interest on national debt are also part of the current $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.

> * How common is a debt ceiling increase? Very common is the short answer. The first time it was used was in 1917 to help finance World War I and has happened more than 100 times since. In fact, every President back to Eisenhower has increased the debt ceiling, for a total of 89 times since 1959. President Biden has increased it twice already, which is the least number of times any President has increased it going back 11 Presidents.

> * What happens if the current debt ceiling isn’t increased? In theory the U.S. would default on their debt, meaning they’ve run out of money and can’t pay the bills. We do not expect this to happen, and it has only happened once in history, in 1979, but that was more of a clerical error and was fixed rather quickly. Janet Yellen recently said it needs to be increased or such a failure would lead to a “steep economic downturn” in the U.S.

> * Who else does it this way? The only two countries who have a debt ceiling and require the Government to vote on it and set the limits are the U.S. and Denmark. That’s it. Nearly all other countries set things as a percentage of their GDP. Why does this U.S. choose to do it this way? This one may be out of my paygrade, but I think it could have something to do with why we like our political theater here in the U.S.

> * When will the U.S. run out of money? This is known as the ‘X date’, when the U.S. will run out of money. No one knows this exact day, but Janet Yellen recently said it could be as early as June 1, well before when some of the well-known investment banks were forecasting. Sometime in June seems to be the most widely expected timeframe.

> * What options does Congress have? They could do nothing and potentially let the U.S. default, while they could also raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling. Another option is Congress can suspend the debt ceiling, something they did seven times since 2013, including as recently as August 2019 to July 2021. President Biden has invited the major members of Congress (Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Hakeem Jefferies) to the White House today (May 9) to discuss and find a resolution.

> * What about the makeup of Congress? Speaking of Congress, the debt ceiling has historically been increased whether we’ve had a Democratic, Republican or split Congress. Majority of the time, debt ceilings have been raised when Democrats have full control, though that’s because they were in the power majority of the time since 1959. Specifically, when we have a split Congress (like right now, with a Democratic Senate and Republican House), the debt ceiling has been increased 24 times. So, history says that a split Congress shouldn’t be an impediment to raising the ceiling yet again.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-2-800x296.png))**

> * How likely is a deal? Sonu put together this great SWOT analysis of President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, with some help from Punchbowl News. The Carson Investment Research team’s base case remains that there’s a big disconnect between the two sides right now, but the opportunity is there for some dealing with a final deal before the clock strikes midnight after the final posturing. Ultimately, it’s in neither President Biden’s or Speaker McCarthy’s interest to see a default, and potential economic catastrophe, under their watch.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blog-4.png)**

> * What happens if they let the U.S. default? We’d like to stress this is not the base case and we fully expect cooler heads to prevail, but should the U.S. default on its debt (meaning they miss a bond payment to holders of Treasuries) the chances greatly increase of much higher interest rates, a likely recession, and extreme market volatility. Many investors remember back in the summer of 2011 when both sides had trouble agreeing on a new debt ceiling and S&P downgraded the debt on the U.S., causing nearly a 19% decline in the S&P 500 over the following week.

> * What do most of the experts think? Most political experts we follow expect the debt ceiling to be increased before X date, making it 90 increases since 1959. This is Washington after all and everyone has an agenda, but we don’t expect the current members of Congress want to be blamed should the U.S. default on its debt, causing a major drop in the stock market and potential recession right ahead of an election year.

> So there you have it, 11 things to know about the current debt ceiling drama. We are a long way from a resolution and this will likely be all over the news the coming weeks, but in the end, we think the football will be punted once again.

> # Megacaps Still Carrying Their Weight

> Heading into earnings season, there was a considerable amount of angst on the part of investors regarding the mecacap stocks and how they would react to their earnings reports. Given their outperformance in Q1, the prevailing view was that the bar was too high, leaving the megacaps susceptible to disappointment when they reported. Within the S&P 500, there are seven companies whose weighting exceeds 1.5% in the index, and in the chart below we list the performance of each company's stock (largest to smallest) on the earnings reaction day of their most recent report. Of the seven companies highlighted, only two (Alphabet and Amazon.com) declined in reaction to their reports. Two stocks (Nvidia and Meta) surged more than 10%, one (Microsoft) rallied more than 7%, and Apple, with its weighting of over 7%, managed to rise more than 4.5% following its report last week. There's still a ton of reports left to get through before earnings season winds down, but on a market cap basis, we're past the peak, and based on the reactions of the largest companies in the market, it's been a much better earnings season than most investors expected.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great new trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"
131,Which industry will benefit the most with cost savings due to AI advancements? Insurance?,7,12ua2t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ua2t5/which_industry_will_benefit_the_most_with_cost/,25,1682094879.0,"When we think about investing in AI, we usually tend to think about companies like Google that own DeepMind, or companies like Microsoft that have a stake in OpenAI. We think about Nvidia as a hardware player.

It's fine to invest in these companies, because if AI takes off huge, they'll all reap tremendous rewards, but what about the companies that will use these new AI tools to eliminate huge swaths of their payroll? I think we should concentrate on companies that can continue to do everything that their business model is aligned to do, just with 70 percent less human employees. The gigantic cost savings will start showing up in their surprising earnings beats, and the valuations for these companies will start to accelerate. 

So, which industry uses thousands of human workers to process forms and documents, that won't need any of these workers anymore once AI has completely automated their process? The first industry that popped into my mind is Insurance. Should we look for insurance companies with the largest number of current workers likely to be phased out?

Look, I know this is depressing, but what else are we going to do? If we're all going to have our jobs replaced, might as well get rich investing in these companies on the way out. I don't want to come across as a vulture that's just following a group of travelers in the Sahara desert, just waiting for them to drop dead so they can feast, but it is.... what it is."

They have been dropping steadily since June.

Is there something happening in the industry I am missing? I wouldn't think these basic industries using known technology are affected much by daily politics and would have a steady growth. But they are now at pre-Covid prices.

~8% of my portfolio is Rio Tinto and I was thinking of increasing that and buying BHP and/or Vale"

# [Stock futures slip as investors eye debt ceiling clash in Washington: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell slightly Wednesday as investors kept an eye on debt ceiling negotiations.
*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 151 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures declined by 0.4%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were down 0.3%.
*****
> Negotiators for both sides were expected to meet again Wednesday morning, according to Reuters.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen previously warned lawmakers that a potential default in early June is “highly likely.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he had a “productive” discussion with President Joe Biden on Monday. Nonetheless, there were few indicators of progress made in negotiations on Tuesday.
*****
> Even if Washington’s officials were to raise the debt ceiling, however, markets could be roiled, according to Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. That’s because the Treasury will need to issue a lot of debt to replenish its general account, he said.
*****
> “The impact of that is likely to remove liquidity from the broader capital markets,” Merz said. “Especially more recently, [that] has really overlapped with, or it has correlated with, S&P 500 in general stock performance,” he continued.
*****
> “Especially more recently, [that] has really overlapped with, or it has correlated with, the S&P 500 in general stock performance,” Merz said.
*****
> On the economic front, investors will be watching for the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s meeting earlier in May. They will be released Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> Investors will also be looking toward more earnings announcements. Clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters and semiconductor giant Nvidia will be posting their results Wednesday after the bell.
*****
> The three major averages fell during Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 1.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.26% and 0.69%, respectively.

*****
> Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
> Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
> Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
> “We’ve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They’ve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,” said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC’s “The Exchange.”
*****
> As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
> “I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‘Wizard of Oz’ and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,” Cashin said.
*****
> Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
> Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

> # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

> It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

> In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

> # Let’s Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

> As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&P 500 are rarer than you may think.

> If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don’t see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

> Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

> * The year after, a negative return saw the S&P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
> * A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
> * Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
> * However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
> * Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

> # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

> “It’s not what you look at that matters; it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau

> I’ve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let’s be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

> The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

> You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.” We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

> What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

> That’s right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don’t hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

> Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

> # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

> As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

> For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

> Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

> As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

> As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

> # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

> Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as “year ends make great exits,” a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000’s record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

> # Country ETFs in 2022

> Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

> With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

> In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

> # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

> January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

> DJIA and S&P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 & 2021 as DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

> However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

> # Falling FAANG+

> Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

> NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

> Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

> With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

That's over a 300% gain since May 2022. It is performing over 300% better than the consumer stables sector. So what am I missing? Is this massively overvalued or a company that is just more innovative than the rest? elf is in a competitive space so they do have a lot of competition.

What is there competitive advantage or is this just a massively trending stock with a lot of positive sentiment? Clearly a lot of good news is priced-into the stock. The CEO said in the ER they are still in the early innings of growth for the company. What does that mean? Can they expect a 50-70% increase in net sales year over year next year?

*****
> Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.
*****
> Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender’s credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses.
*****
> “I think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic — it’s simply confused,” said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. “The price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.”
*****
> Ball added that Deutsche Bank is “very sound financially.”
*****
> “It could be crippled if there’s a big loss of confidence and there’s a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.”
*****
> European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed.
*****
> Investors continued to assess the Fed’s latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy.
*****
> On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures.
*****
> “Retail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That’s dangerous,” Ball added. “Banks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.”

> # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low

> We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**

> Taking a look at current S&P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**

> On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.

> # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence

> The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**

> One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**

> The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.

> # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes

> The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**

> Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we’ve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give “guidance” that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.

> Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.

> # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything
> The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.

> Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.

> This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.

> Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed’s March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions “substitute” for rate hikes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**

> # There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead
> While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:

> * How big will the impact be?

> * How long will the impact last?

> These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.

> Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don’t expect rate cuts this year.

> Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**

> There’s clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:

> * Market expectations move higher – if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don’t look to be tightening significantly.

> * Fed expectations move lower – if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.

> Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It’s going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.

> # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?

> Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**

> In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**

> While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.

> # A Fed Day Like Most Others

> Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.

> The S&P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**

> So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.

> It’s been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank’s stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**

> # Why is this happening?
> The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.

> # Why this matters to investors?
> The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we’re in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.

> Maybe it’s an overreaction as “banking crisis” headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn’t a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.

> # FANG+ Flying

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**

> Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&P 500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**

> More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.

> # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned

> It’s encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.

> Last week’s gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.

> The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&P is down 27 of the last 40 year – and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.

> In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it’s a good time to remember Warren Buffet’s wise words to “Be greedy when others are fearful.”

> Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.

> # Nasdaq Leaves the S&P in the Dust

> Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**

> Historically, the major indices, namely the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).

# **S&P 500 breaks six-day win streak on Friday, but still notches best week since March: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
*****
> Stocks slipped on Friday as Wall Street closed out a huge week in which investors received a pause on rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, plus encouraging inflation data.
*****
> The S&P 500 ticked down 0.37% to close at 4,409.59, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 108.94 points, or 0.32%, to close at 34,299.12. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.68% to finish the session at 13,689.57.
*****
> Here are the major market milestones on the week:
> * The S&P 500 is up 2.6% on the week, its best performance since March.
> * It’s the S&P 500′s fifth positive week in a row, the first such streak since November 2021.
> * The benchmark is now up more than 26% from its bear market low.
> * The Nasdaq Composite is up about 3.3% on the week, its best week since March.
> * The Nasdaq is up eight weeks in a row, its best winning streak since 2019.
> * Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up six days in a row through Thursday.
> * The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 1.3% for the week, its third positive week in a row.
> * The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit their highest levels since April 2022.
*****
> The Federal Reserve delivered what investors wanted this week when the central bank left rates unchanged Wednesday after 10 consecutive hikes. While the Fed signaled that two more rate increases were coming this year, many traders and economists on Wall Street believe the Fed could be nearly done. Earlier in the week, the May consumer price index came in at the lowest in two years.
*****
> Adobe added 0.9% after beating results and issuing upbeat guidance, the latest tech stock to rally. AI darling Nvidia gained 10% this week, adding to its 192% surge this year. Microsoft added 4.7% this week and hit a record Thursday. Tech shares were the hardest hit initially when the Fed embarked on its rate-hiking campaign.
*****
> “Wall Street remains upbeat that the AI wave won’t be going away anytime soon and that investors will prefer US stocks as we see diverging central bank policies worldwide,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “This stock market rally seems a bit overextended but too much money remains on the sidelines, which means if the AI trade remains intact, this winning streak for the S&P 500 can continue.”
*****
> Friday brought more good news on the inflation and economic front. Consumer inflation expectations fell in June, with one-year assumptions for price pressures declining to 3.3% from 4.2% in May. The headline reading from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers came in at 63.9, higher than estimates of 60.2 from Dow Jones.
*****
> Friday’s session saw choppy moves across the stock market as stock options, index futures and index future option contracts.
*****
> Friday also marks the final trading day before a long weekend, with the market closed Monday in observation of Juneteenth.

> # Four Things the Bulls Need to Know

> “The stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming.” -Old stock market axiom

> Here are four things that have caught my attention over the past week.

> First up, you might have heard by now, but the S&P 500 moved into a new bull market, up more than 20% from the October ’22 lows. We wrote about this in detail here, but investors need to know that a year after this happened, the S&P 500 was historically up 17.7% on average and higher 12 out of 13 times.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-1-3-800x381.png))**

> Adding to the fun, S&P 500 finally made a new 52-week high this week, the first one since early January 2022. What does this mean? Below we looked at all the times stocks went at least one year without a new 52-week high and the good news is more strength is quite likely. A year later stocks have been higher an incredible 15 out of 15 times and up more than 17% on average. Adding that to the numbers in the first table and the next year could continue to surprise to the upside.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/blog-2-3-800x477.png))**

> Next up, this week marked officially eight months since the bear market ended. To think stocks would be up more than 20% by now would have been crazy to most investors if they were being honest. The quote I used above is one I always think about when stocks fall and it really does sum up investor sentiment well. Very few were saying ‘buy stocks’ last October and most didn’t say it early in 2023 either.

> We did note the week of the lows why the lows were likely in (and boy did the bears hate that call), but even I’ve got to admit the strength this year has been impressive. We moved to overweight equities in our Carson House View models in mid-December and we added to equity risk in late March during the regional bank crisis. To sum it up, we’ve been in the lonely bullish camp and continue to think higher prices are coming.

> What does eight months without a new 52-week low mean? It would be extremely rare for stocks to roll over and make new lows from here for starters. Also, three months later the S&P 500 was up 85% of the time, six months later 90% of the time, and a year later 80% of the time higher. The bottom line, once you get to eight months without a new 52-week low, the upward trajectory likely stays in place.

> Lastly, the bear market officially started a year ago this week, as the S&P 500 moved to down 20% from the January ’22 peak on 6/13/2022. That wasn’t a fun time for investors at all, but here we are a year later, and stocks are up more than 16%. In other words, had you had the intestinal fortitude to buy when all the headlines were negative, you’d be sitting on some great gains a year later. Again, think about the quote at the top of this blog. This is what is important to always remember. Stocks go up and they go down. If you want to get some good deals, you need to buy when they are lower.

> # Why the Fed Wasn’t As Hawkish As Everyone Thinks

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) didn’t raise rates in June, leaving the Federal Funds rate in the 5-5.25% range. This was the first meeting in which they held back ever since they started raising rates back in March 2022.

> However, the big news was that Fed members project rates to be 0.5%-points higher than what they projected back in March. Members updated their projections for rates to hit 5.6% at the end of 2023, up from the previous estimate of 5.1%. By itself, this was viewed as a very hawkish signal, despite the pause in rate hikes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Fed-rate-projections-600x800.png))**

> If you recall, the last set of projections was made in March soon after the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. At the time, they said that potential credit tightening would be equivalent to rate hikes, so they left projections unchanged.

> Fast forward three months and the economy looks to have weathered the banking crisis, even as core inflation (excluding food and energy) remains elevated. Hence the update to where they believe rates should be at the end of 2023.

> However, the rest of the materials they released, along with Fed Chair Powell’s comments suggest more rate hikes are not a certainty.

> **The Fed is (finally) acknowledging the economy’s resilience**

> Along with interest rate projections, Fed members also updated their economic projections. This is where things got interesting. The updated projections included:

> * Raising 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%
>  * Dropping the 2023 unemployment rate from 4.5% to 4.1%

> Despite projecting more rate hikes, they seem to believe that economic growth will be stronger than they expected back in March, and the unemployment rate lower.

> At the same time, they also expect inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index (their preferred measure) to be 3.9% y the end of 2023. In March, the expectation was 3.6%. The higher projection makes sense within the context of the economic strength we’re seeing currently (we’ve written about this).

> Moreover, Fed members expect core inflation to slow to 2.6% in 2024, leading them to project interest rate cuts worth about 1%. Even as the economy grows 1.1% in 2024.

> Take all these projections with several grains of salt. Moreover, these projections are not forecasts – instead, they’re more like best guesses.

> However, it is a sign that Fed officials finally believe that inflation can slow down without a recession. That’s a significant turnaround from what they’ve been signaling over the last year, i.e. a huge economic slowdown/recession is necessary for inflation to fall.

> In fact, Powell acknowledged that the conditions are in place for inflation to slow down – economic growth has fallen below trend though activity remains strong, the labor market is less tight, and goods supply chain disruptions are easing.

> Pausing in June allows them to get more information about the impact of rate hikes and the banking crisis. Now, the July Fed meeting is only 6 weeks away and there’s not enough data that will give them that information. Instead, they’re looking for at least 3 months of data to see how things evolve.

> That buys time and indicates that 2 more rate hikes (each worth 0.25%) are not a sure thing. At the same time, raising the 2023 estimate ensures that investors believe they are serious about curbing inflation, and gives them the optionality to increase rates if inflation remains persistent.

> **Good news: inflation looks to be headed lower**

> Headline CPI inflation has decelerated from a peak of 9.1% year-over-year in June 2022 to 4% in May. Over the past three months, inflation is running at a 2.2% annualized pace, the slowest 3-month pace since two and half years.

> The big driver of the pullback has been energy, but more recently, food prices have also started falling. Vehicle prices, which boosted inflation last year, are also moving lower – used car prices rose over the last two months, but private data indicates that it’s going to reverse soon.

> What’s left? As the chart below indicates, a lot of it is shelter inflation (the dark green bar). This is the main reason why core inflation remains elevated, running at a 5% annualized pace over the last three months. That’s simply too high for the Fed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-HEadline-inflation-breakdown-662x800.png))**

> The good news is that shelter inflation looks to be at an inflection point. We’ve discussed in the past how the official rental inflation data has a significant lag to the private market data. Private data have been showing rents to be decelerating for more than a year now. It’s taken a while, but the official data is now turning around as well. It is a bit like turning an aircraft carrier around, and so it is going to take a while. But it is just a matter of time before core inflation decelerates on the back of falling shelter inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-rental-inflation-private-vs-official-598x800.png))**

> Now, the Fed has said that they need to see even services inflation excluding shelter decelerate. We received good news on that front. The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the Sticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter. It measures inflation for items whose prices typically don’t change frequently. Over the past 3 months, this measure is running at a 2.5% annualized pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Blog-2023-06-14-Sticky-CPI-615x800.png))**

> On top of this, the producer price index, which measures input prices for businesses and typically leads inflation, has collapsed to just 1.2% year-over-year in May. That’s well off the peak pace of 11.6% we saw in March 2022, and lower than the pre-pandemic average of 2%. Even excluding food and energy, PPI is down to 2.8% now from 9.7% 14 months ago.

> All in all, there’s encouraging news on the inflation front even as the economy remains resilient. Powell’s comments reflect that. This is why we’re not quite so convinced that two more rate hikes are baked in. But expect them to leave rates higher for longer.

> # Why Strong Stock Returns on Friday is Bullish

> One of the most hated and despised rallies continued last week, with the S&P now up nearly 12% on the year and officially up more than 20% from the October lows. If you’ve been reading or listening to what the Carson Investment Research team has been saying, then you know we’ve been in the camp we’ve been in a new bull market for quite some time now, expecting continued higher prices. None the less, with stocks now officially up 20%, we see others finally coming around. For instance, check out the cover of Barron’s over the weekend. Yeah, we sure weren’t seeing things like that in January, were we?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Slide1-1-800x450.png))**

> Sonu and I both wrote blogs last week on stocks being up 20% from the lows and you can read them here and here. Additionally, here’s a Yahoo! Finance hit I did on October 13, the exact day that stocks officially bottomed. I noted many reasons to think better times were coming and fortunately, that is exactly what has happened.

> Additionally, here’s the blog I wrote a week after the October lows titled Why Stocks Likely Just Bottomed. Our bullish tilt since late last year wasn’t popular and has been widely mocked by many bears for months and months. We aren’t hearing so much chirping from them now though

> One thing we’ve notice lately is buying and strength in stocks later in the week, specifically on Thursday and Friday. We love to see this, as it shows there is confidence to hold stocks over the weekend. Those of us that have done this long enough remember how volatile (and usually bearish) Friday afternoons would be during the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) or during the COVID bear market in February and March of 2020. Even last year during the bear market we saw historically weak returns on Friday.

> So, to now see buying and confidence on Thursday and Friday in ’23 are significant changes from what we saw during previous bearish phases and could be another clue that this bull market is indeed healthy and likely has legs left.

> This first chart shows just how much better Thursday and Friday are doing than the other days this year. Again, we like to see this late week buying as a clue things are healthy and confident. (For those wondering how we did the annualized return calculations, the average Friday return this year so far has been a gain of 0.40%, so we multiplied that by 252 (the number of trading days per year) to get an annualized return).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pic3-800x450.png))**

> Let’s talk specifically about Friday, shall we? As of last week, Friday was up an incredible 101.7% on an annualized basis in ’23. This would come in as the best Friday EVER. Now, let’s be honest, the odds do favor this coming back to earth some over the remaining rest of the year, but overall we are on a great start to this year being one of the best ever for stocks on a Friday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pic2_Edited-800x450.png))**

> What does it all mean you ask? In the final table below, I looked at all years that had at least a 55% annualized return on Friday. This was the very best 12 years ever for Friday returns and sure enough, they are also some of the best years overall for stocks. In other words, some of the best years ever also saw strong performance on the last day of the week, further confirming that buying on a Friday is what you tend to see in bullish markets.

> We will end on this note, stocks were higher 12 out of 12 times in these years and up a very impressive 24.8% on average, about half of this year’s 12.0% return so far. This could be a subtle clue that as good as this year has been, it could have more in the tank before all is said and done. I did discuss this Friday concept on Yahoo! Finance on Friday.

> # Solid Pre-Election June Gains As Expected

> June is delivering much better than typical pre-election year strength, but NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are leading the charge as usual. R2K was up 7% for the month yesterday and NAS was up 4%, both up more today. However, June quarterly OpEx is riddled with volatility. Week after DJIA is Down 27 of the last 33 years 1990-2022. (2023 STA page 108.) S&P down 23 of 33. NASDAQ down 18/33.

> So far in 2023 NASDAQ is closely tracking the pre-election pattern up 28.6% year-to-date! But remember, June ends NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months with a seasonal peak in mid-July. Enjoy this AI/Chip-driven rally for now and use it to reposition for the Worst 4 Months July-October.

> The backdrop is set up for sideways action over the weak summer months, especially after mid-July into the worst two months of the year August and September. This is lining up well for our NASDAQ Best 8 Months MACD Seasonal Sell Signal that can occur anytime on or after June 1. AI (Almanac Investor) subscribers will be emailed when it triggers.

> # More Balanced June

> Heading into the month of June, stock market performance this year was a clear case of the haves and the have-nots. The chart below shows the performance of S&P 500 sectors on a YTD basis through the end of May. As of 5/31, just three sectors - Technology, Communications Services, and Consumer Discretionary - were outperforming the S&P 500 YTD, and the eight other sectors were not only underperforming the S&P 500's YTD gain of 8.9%, but they were also all down on a YTD basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/06/061323-Sectors-YTD.png))**

> The flip of the calendar has seen the trend of uneven YTD returns flip as well. Besides the fact that every sector is up on a MTD basis, the number of sectors outperforming the S&P 500's 4.6% MTD gains are much more evenly split with five sectors outperforming and six underperforming. Surprisingly, one of those sectors lagging behind the S&P 500 is Technology! Uneven market returns have been a key complaint of bears all year. If the pattern of June continues, though, what will they blame next?

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday after the Biden administration and Republican lawmakers reached a tentative deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures gained 0.6%. Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 1.2%.
*****
> President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default over the weekend, with Congress set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday. Lawmakers have not signaled that they intended to return to Capitol Hill early to work on the deal. Both Republican and Democratic support is needed for the bill agreement to pass.
*****
> “Although the upcoming votes in Congress still pose a small risk, the main risk had been that political pressures would prevent a deal from coming together,” wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a note. “Now that a deal has been reached, it seems very likely to pass both chambers of Congress in the coming week.”
*****
> The agreement comes just days before the so-called “X date” on June 5, which is the earliest date the Treasury Department has signaled the U.S. could default on debt obligations. The initial compromise was first announced on Saturday evening.
*****
> The long negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders raised concern among investors that a default on U.S. debt could take place. Wall Street has already contended with persistent inflation and a banking crisis this year.
*****
> Stocks closed higher on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 finished last week with gains. The market was closed Monday due to Memorial Day.
*****
> Investors will also turn their attention to May jobs data out on Friday, while the April Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be released on Wednesday. Corporate earnings from HP Inc and Salesforce are due on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

# **Dow sheds more than 100 points Friday, but notches fourth straight positive week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday, but was headed for a positive week, as investors assessed a weak retail sales report that dented enthusiasm around a stronger-than-expected start to corporate earnings.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow dropped 143.22 points, or about 0.42%, to 33,886.47. The S&P 500 fell 0.21% to 4,137.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.35% to 12,123.47.
*****
> The Dow, however, notched its fourth-straight positive week, rising 1.2%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, meanwhile, nabbed their fourth positive week in five. The broad-market index added 0.79% for the week, while the Nasdaq ticked higher by 0.29%.
*****
> Advance retail sales in March showed consumer spending fell twice as much as expected. Retail sales declined by 1% last month, more than the 0.5% drop expected by economists polled by Dow Jones, in part because consumers paid less for fuel.
*****
> “Retail sales came in weaker than expected, but a lot of the miss had to do with lower gas prices, which all things being equal is a slight positive for spending,” wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Inflation has been coming down as gas prices have been coming down, but that can reverse in an instant, which would drive the headline numbers higher. What is more concerning is that core (which excludes food and gas prices) has been stubbornly high – and where we believe the risks to higher-rates-for-longer lie,” Zaccarelli added.
*****
> The disappointing retail sales data offset excitement around strong corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase reported record revenue that beat analysts’ expectations, with the stock rising more than 7%. Wells Fargo shares briefly rose as much as 2.1% after the bank reported growing profits, before closing about flat. These were the first bank earnings since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month.
*****
> Elsewhere, UnitedHealth, which has the biggest weighting in the Dow, fell 2.7% after what Mizuho described as a “modest beat and raise.” The action came after UnitedHealth said it’s spending more for new diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.
*****
> Meanwhile, Boeing closed lower by more than 5%. On Thursday, the aircraft maker warned of delivery delays for some of its 737 Max planes.
*****
> Expectations for this earnings season are downbeat. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect S&P 500 earnings fell more than 5% in the first quarter. That forecast comes as companies deal with persistent inflation and higher rates.
*****
> “The bar has never been set lower,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “My guess is with consensus expectations for the S&P 500 to show earnings that are down some 5%, that may well be overstating what we actually find out.”
*****
> “I think that what’s going to be super important is the kind of guidance we get, and how confident that corporations will be in guiding for the next three quarters in the face of what likely will be a slower economy.”
*****
> Investors also assessed two back-to-back reports this week signaling cooling inflation. The March producer price index, a measure of prices paid by companies, declined 0.5% from the prior month, even as economists polled by Dow Jones expected prices to stay the same. Excluding food and energy, the index shed 0.1% from the prior month, while economists estimated a 0.2% month-to-month increase.
*****
> The PPI, which is considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation, bolstered a trend of easing inflation seen in the March consumer price index report released Wednesday. Consumer prices grew 5% on an annual basis, which was the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly two years.

> # Three More Bullish Signals The Bears Don’t Want To See

> “If you don’t know where you want to get to….it doesn’t matter which way you go.” -The Cheshire Cat to Alice in Alice in Wonderland.

> Stocks have continued to stage an impressive rally off the mid-March lows, so much so that we have now seen multiple rare and potentially bullish signals trigger. Today, I’ll take a look at three of these signals. Yes, by itself any one of these signals could be noise, but when you start stacking them on top of each other, like the Cheshire Cat said in the quote above, stocks likely want to go higher and we should be ready to know where they could head.

> First up, the S&P 500 had it’s best first quarter since 2019, up 7.0%, which came on the heels of 7.1% gain the quarter before. What happened after previous big first quarters? I found there were 16 other first quarters that gained at least 5% and the final three quarters of the year finished higher 15 times. Yes, the one year that didn’t work was 1987 and when people hear that year, they start to get worried. Well, stocks were up 40% for the year in August back then, so we’ll worry about having another 1987 if we see returns like that (which we don’t expect). Until then, this is another clue the bulls could have a nice 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-800x564.png))**

> Next, we’ve heard a lot how only a few stocks are leading the overall markets higher. We don’t fully agree there and one way to show this is there was a recent sign of extreme buying pressure across many sectors and stocks. Using data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, more than 93% of the stocks in the NDR universe were recently above their 10-day moving average. All you need to know here is this is a rare sign of broad-based strength and a year later stocks were higher 23 out of 24 times with some very solid returns along the way.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-2-800x338.png))**

> Lastly, Marty Zweig is known as one of the best traders ever and he coined the Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) indicator many years ago. Well, we just saw a rare trigger of this potentially bullish signal. To keep it simple, this signal looks at all the stocks on the NYSE and it looks for periods of extreme oversold periods moving to periods of extremely overbought in a short timeframe. Think of it as a washout and then heavy buying coming in, which tends to open the door to higher prices.

> The table below shows the previous 14 ZBTs and what happened next. Wouldn’t you know it, but the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time. That is 14 out of 14 and up 23.3% on average. Sure, the sample size isn’t probably as large as we’d like to consider this statistically relevant, but I’d sure rather know this than ignore it.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-3-800x755.png))**

> Finally, here’s a chart showing the ZBTs. Sometimes a picture tells the story and one look at this, and it would be quite rare for this signal to trigger and for stocks to simply drop right back to new lows. In fact, usually it happens ahead of periods of strength.

*****

> # First Republic and Other Banks See Large Jumps in Short Interest

> Short interest figures get published every two weeks, and movements in short interest are a helpful way to gauge bull/bear positioning on individual names as well as groups and sectors. When a stock has a high percentage of shares sold short, it means that a lot of investors are betting against it. If a highly-shorted company manages to produce better than expected results, however, shares will often see outsized gains as many of those shorts rush to cover.

> With bank failures and deposit flight emerging in March, causing two S&P 500 bank stocks to fail and many other regional bank stocks to fall precipitously, we were interested to see how short interest levels changed during the month. End-of-month short interest figures for March were just recently published, and below is a table showing stocks in the S&P 1500 that saw the biggest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) during the month.

> As shown, the two stocks that saw the biggest increases in short interest were First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW). At the end of February, FRC only had 2.71% of its float sold short, but by the end of March, that figure had spiked to 29.51%. PacWest's jump in short interest was slightly less extreme, but it was extreme nonetheless, rising from 3.59% up to 20.56% in March. Another nine Financials are on the list of the 30 S&P 1500 stocks that saw the biggest jumps in SIPF in March, while another five REITs made the list as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/changesipf.png))**

> Below is a better look at just how much short interest spiked for First Republic (FRC) in March. While the bank did see a mini-spike in late 2018 when the broader market was struggling with another batch of Fed tightening, FRC's short interest normally sits between 0-5% of float. Now it's up to nearly 30%. For a stock that's down 94% from its highs, where do you think the risk/reward lies at this point?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/frcfloat.png))**

> In terms of the most heavily shorted stocks, only Big Lots (BIG) currently has a higher percentage of its float sold short than FRC in the S&P 1500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/sp1500short.png))**

> Below is a chart showing the average change in SIPF for stocks in the S&P 1500 by industry group in the month of March. As shown, the Banks saw the biggest average jump at 0.78 ppts, followed by Telecom Services, Media & Entertainment, and REITs. Stocks in the Consumer Durables & Apparel group saw the largest decline in SIPF at -0.23 ppts.

> # Sentiment: Back to the 20s

> Whereas last week saw a huge rebound in bullish sentiment after the S&P 500's breakout above March highs, the more listless price action of the past week resulted in a modest turnaround in sentiment. The latest AAII sentiment survey showed only 26.1% of respondents reported as bullish compared to the recent high of 33.3% last week. The 7.2 percentage point decline was the largest one-week drop in bulls since the last week of February when it declined by 12.5 percentage points. That leaves bullish sentiment right in the middle of the range since the start of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment fell, without any considerable push lower for the S&P 500, bearish sentiment went little changed falling just half of one percentage point down to 34.5%. Like last week, that remains the lowest reading since the week of February 16th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-2.png))**

> That means that all of the declines in bullish and bearish sentiment flowed to the neutral camp with a surge of 7.9 percentage points; the largest one-week increase since the first week of the year. At 39.5%, neutral sentiment is at the high end of the past few years' range and only 0.3 percentage points below the late February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-4.png))**

> The AAII survey was not the only sentiment reading to take a more bearish tone this week. The NAAIM Exposure index's latest release today showed investment managers reduced equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey's bull-bear spread has actually continued to rise resulting in the highest reading since the first week of 2022. Additionally, as we noted in Monday's Chart of the Day, the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index went unchanged in March after rebounding in the proceeding few months. In other words, across multiple readings, sentiment has improved but has yet to definitively shift to bullish.

> The March inflation report showed that CPI inflation rose only 0.1%, slightly below expectations. Over the past year, inflation is now up 5%, well off the peak 9% from June 2022. As you can see below, the big driver of lower inflation has been energy and food.

> Energy makes up about 7% of the “inflation basket”, split almost equally into commodities (like gasoline) and services (like electricity and piped gas). Thanks to the pullback in oil prices, energy commodity prices are now below where they were in December 2021. The recent drop in natural gas prices has also sent services prices lower over the past couple of months.

> Further good news: prices for “food at home”, i.e. groceries, fell 0.3% in March. This is the first price decline since September 2020, and bodes well even for prices and restaurants and such (which are still elevated).

> # Lower energy and food prices are a big deal, for consumption
> Lower inflation, by way of lower energy and food prices, means “real” incomes, i.e. incomes adjusted for inflation, remain strong. More so if the labor market remains healthy, which looks to be the case as we wrote the other day.

> The chart below shows annualized growth rates of disposable income, employee compensation (across all workers in the economy), and inflation. Over the past 3, 6 and 12 months, disposable income has run ahead of inflation. Part of this is because social security incomes got a big inflation-adjusted boost in January. But even employee compensation is running ahead of inflation. That’s really positive for consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the economy.

> # The big story: Housing inflation may finally be turning (lower)
> Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% in March. Over the past 3 months, core inflation is up 5.1% (annualized pace) and its up 5.6% over the past year. So, not much of a slowdown.

> Part of the reason is that housing inflation has been running high.

> But we got very good news on that front. Rents of primary residences and owners’ equivalent rent (rental equivalent of owner-occupied homes) rose “only” 0.5%. While still high, that pace is the slowest monthly increase in a year. Over the past 9 months, housing inflation averaged about +0.7% per month, which translates to a whopping 9% annualized rate!

> So, the slowdown in March is significant, and most welcome.

> Of course, as we’ve written about in the past, we’ve already seen a sharp deceleration in market rents. It’s just that the official inflation data has been really slow to catch up to that reality. But that may be changing now and bodes well for core inflation to slow down across the rest of this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-rents-market-vs-official-599x800.png))**

> # The bad news: Core inflation ex housing remains elevated
> That was the good news, i.e. a slowdown in energy, food and housing inflation. However, the rest of it still looks to be elevated.

> For one thing, vehicle prices are no longer falling as fast as they were. Vehicle prices, especially for used cars, was another big factor in pulling inflation lower over the last few months. Used car prices fell 0.9% in March, but that’s the smallest decline in 7 months. Private data suggests that used car prices are rising again. New vehicle prices also rose 0.4%, breaking a recent downward trend.

> Outside of vehicles, a lot of goods and services that were initially hit by the pandemic are still seeing significant price increases. These include goods like household furnishings and apparel, and services like hotels and airlines fares.

> Even beyond that, services such as day care, personal care, and recreation, are seeing inflation running well above what we saw before the pandemic.

> All of which is a sign that demand for these goods and services remains strong.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-supercore-select-items-inflation-601x800.png))**

> # What does this mean for the Fed?
> Fed officials have explicitly said that they want to see core services ex housing decelerate. In short, they’re looking at inflation excluding energy, food and housing, the three categories where we’ve had positive news. Unfortunately, there’s not much evidence that this slice of the inflation basket is decelerating, yet. The good news is that it tends to be correlated to wage growth, and there’s strong evidence that wage growth is moving closer to what we saw pre-pandemic.

> Now, the Fed is unlikely to continue raising interest rates much further from here, especially since we had a banking crisis, and they may want to play cautious. Plus, as we wrote a few weeks ago, banks tightening credit in response to the crisis is akin to rate increases.

> At the same time, they are likely to keep rates where they are until they see convincing evidence of inflation falling, especially core services ex housing inflation.

> This is not what investors expect. Instead, investors expect the Fed to start cutting rates in late summer, pricing in at least 3 rate cuts by the end of 2023. Indicating that bond investors believe a crisis or recession is likely in the near-term. That’s clearly not where Fed officials are right now. We’re not there either, for now.

> Eventually, market pricing and Fed officials’ views must converge. In the meantime, expect volatility, especially in the bond market.

> # 10-Year 10-Baggers

> Peter Lynch's 1989 book One Up On Wall Street introduced investors to the word ""ten bagger,"" which represents an investment that appreciates by 10x (1,000%) its initial purchase price.

> Today we wanted to highlight the stocks that have been ""ten baggers"" over the last ten years. In the Russell 1,000, 33 names are up more than 1,000% since April 12th, 2013. Over the same 10-year period, the S&P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) is up 211%. As shown below, NVIDIA (NVDA) is up the most with a gain of 8,833%, followed by Tesla (TSLA) at 6,304% and then Plug Power (PLUG) at 5,477%.

> There are 16 Technology stocks on the list of 33 ten baggers, which is the most of any sector. Other Tech stocks on the list include AMD, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Broadcom (AVGO), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX), and even the two largest stocks in the US - Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Netflix (NFLX) is also another notable on the list with a gain of 1,266%.

> Some other notables include Industrials stocks like Axon -- the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, Industrials stocks like Builders FirstSource (BLDR) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL), and Vince VcMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is set to be bought by Endeavor Group (EDR).

> Stocks that are already up 1,000%+ over the last ten years seem unlikely to repeat that over the next ten years. The obvious next question is: which stocks will be ten baggers over the next ten years? As Peter Lynch instructed, you'll have to do your research!

> # 3 Small Business Outlook Cratering

>  Small business optimism continued to decline in March with the headline index from the NFIB falling from 90.9 down to 90.1. That headline reading was actually better than the consensus forecast of 89.3, but it was still in the bottom decile of the indicator's historical range dating back to 1986.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB.png))**

> Looking across individual categories, breadth was weak in the report with only three indices moving higher month over month, three going unchanged, and all the others falling. As with the headline number, many categories are also historically depressed in the bottom decile of readings including a record low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-2.png))**

> That record low was in the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand. Only 2% reported now as a good time to expand, down 4 points month over month. Albeit the reading has been at the low end of its historical range for much of the past year, March's reading matched the historical low form March 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-4.png))**

> Given the small business outlook for the economy has soured, fewer firms are reporting plans to increase hiring or capital expenditures. In fact, the index for capex plans fell to 20, which alongside March 2021, is the lowest reading since the spring of 2020. Similarly, hiring plans are at new lows for the post-pandemic period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-3.png))**

> One factor likely impacting business plans has been financial conditions. The most pronounced decline of any category last month was a record 4-point decline in the availability of loans. While the reading has been rolling over for some time, that drop leaves the index at the lowest level since December 2012.

> # Inflation Concerns Continue to Ease

> In an earlier post, we mentioned the record-low reading in the percentage of small businesses perceiving now as a good time to expand. As for what these firms perceive to be their most pressing issues, inflation continues to be the single most prevalent answer at 24%, albeit the gap has narrowed dramatically. Quality of labor is now only a single percentage point behind at 23%, and when combined with cost of labor, the two issues account for over a third of small businesses' biggest problems. From a historical standpoint, those three readings all remain elevated and account for a massive share of the most pressing issues facing small businesses.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

> The four percentage point drop month over month in the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue is the largest decline since January when it had fallen 6 percentage points. As a result, the category is only down to the lowest level since January 2022 which remains well outside the range of pre-pandemic readings. In other words, inflation appears to be improving compared to last July when it was top of mind for 37% of small businesses, but it is still nowhere near a non-issue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

> Picking up some of those losses has been government-related concerns. This series has historically held a political bias in which under Republican administrations small businesses are less concerned with red tape and taxes and vice versa during Democratic administrations. With the surge in inflation concerns during President Biden's tenure, this index has remained historically low but has begun to rise more recently as inflation has improved.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

> Another area to see a rise in firms reporting it as their biggest problem has been poor sales. While the reading is far from flying, it has begun trending higher accounting for 5% of responses in March. That pairs with the index for actual reported sales changes which have remained firmly negative for nearly a year now.

> # 2023 Still Tracking Pre-Election Year Pattern But Gains May Be Muted

> Despite the recent selloff and volatility S&P 500 still tracks typical pre-election year market trends. However, uncertainties about rates, inflation, recession, banking and economic growth are likely to mute the usual pre-election year gains. A debt ceiling standoff could keep stocks under pressure during the Worst Six Months May-October.

145,4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,2,14ezyqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ezyqm/4_tech_stocks_benefiting_from_the_ai_boom/,37,1687329944.0,"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.  
  
This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.  
  
**AI and the US Stock Market**  
In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.  
  
This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.  
  
**""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""**  
This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.  
  
Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. 

# Our Methodology

To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.

# Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom

  
**1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**  
  
On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.  
  
Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.  
  
I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.  
  
TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""  
  
Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.

**4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**

146,Tesla Earnings - some perspective,4,w56glz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w56glz/tesla_earnings_some_perspective/,0,1658483094.0,"Tesla rallied 10% yeterday, post earnings. A move we have not seen in a while. Tesla long held the mantle of poster boy in the US 2020/21 tech rally, fanned my the biggest monetary expansion in history. Does its rally herald a comeback in tech, or is it one last dead cat bounce for the most over-hyped and over-priced stock in history?

To be fair to Tesla, there was some mis-reporting of Free Cash Flows being negative without its BitCoin sales. Not true (FCF = Operating Cash Flows - Cap-Ex), so the $621 million free cash flow was true, the BTC sale an investment cash flow. That said, the $0.8 billion reported net change in cash would have been negative without the BTC sale - which of course saw some loss of credibility to Musk given previous comments on the subject.

Perhaps a better understanding of the motivation for that decision on cash by its CEO and CFO can be helped by seeing the fall in free cash flows:

3Q21: $1,328M, 4Q21: $2,775M, 1Q22: $2,228, 2Q22: $621 

On a quarterly and trailing 12 month basis, Tesla announced:

**Revenues of $16.93 billion ($67.166 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Net (GAAP) profits of $2.259 billion ($9.516 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Free Cash Flow of $621 million ($6.952 billion, 12 month ttv)**

Tesla trades then at:

**13 x Price to sales;**

**89 x Price to earnings;**

**122 x Price to FCF**

Heady numbers, but Tesla is of course a growth stock and all about its future earnings potential in EV cars, semis, pick-ups, robo-taxis, business to business/customer tech sales, battery sales and artificial intelligence. Lets take a look at those areas vs its competitors...

China and Europe's large automobile markets (26 and 12 million sales in 2021) now have 1 in 5 cars sold as plug-ins (BEV/PHEV's) unlike the US mkt still showing only 1 in 20 EV sales from the 15 million vehicles sold in 2021. Tesla of course dominates US EV sales. It no longer does global markets outside of the US. BYD is now the leading global seller of EV's for those investors not paying attention (yes that includes hybrids, but increasingly dominated by BEV's):

[https://techstory.in/byd-overtakes-tesla-in-china-vehicle-sales-in-the-first-half-of-2022/](https://techstory.in/byd-overtakes-tesla-in-china-vehicle-sales-in-the-first-half-of-2022/)

Whilst Tesla still tops individual BEV model lists, its sales are only really across two models now (S and X sales very slight). VW group (presently trading at a measely $85 billion market cap vs Tesla's $845 despite selling 8.6 million cars in 2021) for example produces over a dozen EV models across Audi (e-tron; e-tron Sportback; e-tron GT), Man (electric semis), Porsche (Taycan), Seat (Cupra Born), Skoda (Enyaq/Enyaq Coupe) and VW (ID3; ID4; ID5; e-up; e-golf) brands.

Tesla was surpassed in EV sales by company in 2021 in China and Europe and has now been globally in 2022 It is no wonder with the sheer numbers and quality of alternative models of EV's on sale outside of US markets, for example in China the Xpeng P7 has proven a fierce rival to Tesla (particularly models coming with LIDAR) along with the BYD Han, essentially both mid-range luxury sedans, the equivalents of a Tesla Model S, for the price of a Model 3.

 Whilst Tesla kept Cap Ex to almost maintenance levels in 2020 to help become cash flow positive, Xpeng aggressively ploughs cash inflows into R&D. Hence Xpeng now offers far superior hardware including LIDAR in its self drive hardware/software package, for a lot less money: 

XPeng XPilot: $3,900; 2 LiDAR; 5 radar; 12 sonic sensors; 12 cameras

Tesla FSD: $10,000; no LiDAR; 1 radar; 12 sonic sensors; 8 cameras

Whilst investors eagerly await the production of the Tesla semi, first revealed in 2017 (and the Cybertruck, first revealed in 2019) and its market lead on EV trucking, BYD, Daimler, MAN and Volvo, etc have long been selling them in global markets including the US:

[https://northamerica.daimlertruck.com/emobility](https://northamerica.daimlertruck.com/emobility)

Whilst Tesla robo-taxis have gone quiet and NHSTA oversight looms, Apollo (Baidu) self-driving taxis are up and running in Beijing WITHOUT accompanied human drivers - genuine FSD level 5. Waymo meanwhile has been offering driverless taxis in Phoenix to employees since 2020:

[https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Baidu-s-self-driving-taxis-now-a-common-sight-in-Beijing](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Baidu-s-self-driving-taxis-now-a-common-sight-in-Beijing)

Whilst Tesla is apparently the market leader in lithium battery technology, the long founded rumours have finally been confirmed, BYD is going to supply Tesla with batteries:

[https://insideevs.com/news/590809/byd-supply-tesla-batteries-soon/#:\~:text=It's%20the%20first%20official%20confirmation,were%20later%20denied%20by%20BYD](https://insideevs.com/news/590809/byd-supply-tesla-batteries-soon/#:~:text=It's%20the%20first%20official%20confirmation,were%20later%20denied%20by%20BYD).

Whilst we still await Tesla's superior auto-chips, companies like Infineon, NXP, and Renesas have always led the market supplying companies like XPeng (and Tesla) and providing ever improving technology like 'systems on a chip' for self-driving:

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/self-driving-cars/drive-platform/hardware/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/self-driving-cars/drive-platform/hardware/)

 No, alas Tesla just remains all hype and the last US tech bubble to fall to anywhere near its realistic future earnings valuation, as other US and overseas companies plough far ahead of it in most areas, that myopic Tesla investors, who lack any global perspective, expect Tesla to lead the world."
147,What do you think of the following bits of information and how they will probably/eventually relate to the stock market?,4,13bazpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13bazpr/what_do_you_think_of_the_following_bits_of/,8,1683512738.0,"Here are some random things I have thought about recently and am curious of how we could use them to think a little differently about the market and stocks in near future differently. I know it might sound ridiculous but people thought I was crazy when COVID appeared in the USA in early 2020 that the market and stocks would slide big time. I believe we are going to have a big recession starting in the next 12 months and I absolutely think it will be akin to 2008/2009. Here are some random things I have come across: 

1) My best friend works in a group home and has for over 20 years. They read the mail and listen to phonically that come/go from a group home for people who have addictions to substances. **They swear they have never read about and listened to so many people complain about not being able to pay their bills**. They said it was normal, even in 2008/2009 to maybe come across out of the usual 300 letters a week to maybe have 10 complaining about money. Nope - in the past few months half of the mail has some kind of complaint about how rent is too high, the sender if facing eviction, etc. At first I did not think anything of this but it is definitely interesting. 

2) People are stacking credit card debt like never before source: [https://www.cnbc.com/select/us-credit-card-debt-hits-all-time-high/](https://www.cnbc.com/select/us-credit-card-debt-hits-all-time-high/). I have hundreds of acquittances and on social media people in droves (and I am talking about a large range of people here - people who work fast food to people who are dentists or lawyers) are pretty much saying they are going on vacation, putting it on a credit card, and have no idea how they are going to pay it off but are just like fuck it. 

3) Is it not even remotely upsetting that for many stocks regardless if we are talking small to mega cap that for many the one of few positive days in the past several weeks has been when an announcement is made of massive layoffs? I get why a stock tends to go up between two and four percent if the announcement of layoffs is made: Because that means less money needed to pay people in a high inflation environment we are in, which means the balance sheet will later have more money leftover for shareholders. However, are we just going to pretend that this is normal? Literally handfuls of stocks are not having any good days unless they announce layoffs. This is not normal and our market should not be acting like this. 

What I am trying to convey here is that just like in early 2020 some of us were saying to tread carefully because that thing nobody knew how to even pronounce or spell in February 2020 could become something big and nasty - which it did. I feel the exact same way right now. Are people not going inside casinos and realizing they are empty compared to normal? Or strip clubs? Casinos and strip clubs both require physical money. Sure the restaurants in the casino or next to the strip club might be rocking - but that is because people can charge their soon to be third maxed out credit card for that stuff - **you cannot charge a credit card to go play at the casino or to take part of the strip club**. What I am planning on doing is waiting for the beginning of shit to hit the fan in the next 12 months because (1) inflation is way worse than many think and (2) layoffs will continue and the jobs will not ever come back because AI will be grabbing those in just the next few years... I say a person should day trade SQQQ and when the market dips 30% from where it is right now in May 2023 should begin to dollar cost average back in to stocks that will make you millionaires long term: Apple, Tesla, Roblox, Salesforce, Microsoft, NVIDIA, etc."
148,"For long term growth tech company, is it good time to buy Nvidia now?",5,129zre6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/129zre6/for_long_term_growth_tech_company_is_it_good_time/,73,1680472853.0,"I believe AI is much more real thing than bitcoin, meta-verse. I think this will support Nvidia in the long run for growth. MSFT, GOOG also benefits from AI but given their wide products and diversified business, just feel this will limit their growth.

Tesla is also a good option for growth, but its CEO just too unpredictable, and Tesla has lots of competitors while Nvidia has strong moat for both software CUDA and hardware.

The only question is that, should I buy at $278? The price seems bubble to me given their recent earning report and entire economic environment."
149,Question On Trailing Stop Limits,4,12bkcgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12bkcgm/question_on_trailing_stop_limits/,16,1680617475.0,"Bear with me as I’m a simple trader and really put most my money into 401K and a target date fund, but my Roth IRA is my play account.

I see all sorts of posts asking if someone should sell XYZ shares now because of XYZ reasons and I am wondering why people don’t just use trailing stops and forget about it?

Good example being Nvidia. Their growth recently is crazy from the AI hype, and I’m up way over 20% on them, so instead of gamble missing out on more upside by taking gains now, wouldn’t it make sense to just set a trailing stop if like 10-12% and let it play out?

I mean sure, I stand to lose 10-12% of my gains if they tank from here, but I could lose more if I sold now and they keep going up. Or am I thinking about this all wrong?"

151,Top stocks for June 2023,2,14e2r54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14e2r54/top_stocks_for_june_2023/,5,1687241336.0,"Top U.S. stocks for June include First Solar Inc. ($FSLR), Nvidia Corp. ($NVDA), and Penumbra Inc. ($PEN). The share prices of all have more than doubled in the past year, as the Russell 3000, a capitalization-weighted stock market index used as a benchmark for the entire U.S. stock market, has returned 1%.  
  
Below, we list the top five stocks in each category: value, growth, and momentum. All data below is as of May 26.

# Best Value Stocks

Value investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves picking stocks you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually measured by the ratio of the stock’s price to one or more fundamental business metrics. A widely accepted value metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Value investors say that if a business is cheap compared with its intrinsic value (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case), then the stock price may rise faster than others as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company. These are among the stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing P/E ratio.

# Best Value Stocks

**Southwestern Energy Co.**: An oil and natural gas explorer and producer with properties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Louisiana. In June 2022, the company authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program that can continue through the end of 2023. In the first quarter, Southwestern reported net income of $1.9 billion, swinging from a net loss of $2.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, and a 28% year-over-year revenue decline.

**Chesapeake Energy Corp.**: Chesapeake explores and develops oil and gas properties throughout the U.S. In February, Chesapeake Energy agreed to sell a portion of its Eagle Ford assets to global chemicals company INEOS for approximately $1.4 billion. In the first quarter of 2023, Chesapeake Energy's revenue nearly tripled from the year before and net income totaled $1.4 billion, or $9.60 a share.

**First Citizens BancShares Inc.**: This is a holding company that offers banking services such as deposit products, consumer loans, and commercial leases. First Citizens' net income surged in the most recent quarter after the lender acquired the assets and liabilities of Silicon Valley Bank at a steep discount.

**Ovintiv Inc.**: Ovintiv owns and operates various natural gas and oil properties in the U.S. and Canada. 

**DISH Network Corp.**: A TV service provider that offers programming packages, Sling TV, and wireless subscriber plans. On May 8, the company released its first-quarter earnings results. Net income fell 46%, and overall revenue declined by 9% compared with the same period in 2022. DISH lost over half a million Pay-TV subscribers in the first quarter, and its retail wireless segment posted a 9% reduction in subscribers compared with the previous year.

# Fastest-Growing Stocks

These are the top stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-on-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and their most recent quarterly YOY earnings per share (EPS) growth.  
  
Both sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one or the other figure unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 1,000% were excluded as outliers.

Momentum investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves buying a stock whose price has risen faster than the market as a whole. Momentum investors believe that stocks that have outperformed the market will often continue to do so because the factors that caused them to outperform won't suddenly disappear. In addition, other investors seeking to benefit from the stock’s outperformance will often purchase it, further bidding up its price.

# These are the stocks that had the highest total return over the past 12 months.

**First Solar Inc.**: A solar energy company that makes cadmium telluride solar modules for commercial and industrial uses. Early this year, First Solar sold its 141 MW power plant located in Chile to the company Toesca for an undisclosed amount. On April 27, the company reported first-quarter earnings, with net sales declining by 45% to $548 million. Nonetheless, the company reported net income of $43 million, swinging to a profit from a $43 million loss in the year-ago quarter. The company's stock price rose by approximately 25% in the two weeks after earnings.

**NVIDIA Corp.**: This is a semiconductor company that derives most of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming PCs. On May 24, the company reported first-quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings. Nvidia reported 14% growth in data-center revenue and expanded artificial intelligence (AI) development with multiple partnerships and the introduction of AI Foundations, a generative AI language learning model. Following the earnings report, the company's share price rose by 24%, bringing it briefly to a $1 trillion market cap.

**Penumbra Inc.**: Penumbra develops and sells minimally invasive medical devices that help remove blood clots from the body.

**Netflix Inc.**: An entertainment streaming company that offers a wide range of original and licensed movies and TV shows.

**Axon Enterprise Inc.**: Axon manufactures and sells conducted-energy weapons under the Taser brand, and cloud-based video equipment and software for use by law enforcement. Axon has experienced steady growth over the past year. Axon's YOY revenue jumped 34% in the first quarter on the release of multiple new products and 51% growth in cloud sales.

# Top-Stock Investing Advantages

To become a top stock, a company most likely produces positive trends in its earnings, revenue, and share price. Momentum in these areas indicates a well-run business that has the potential to keep generating profit and creating shareholder value.  
  
Investors can use free stock-screening sites like Finviz to find top stocks, filtering by both fundamental and technical metrics. For example, a trader could find a top stock by scanning for companies that are trading at a new 52-week high or that have reported higher earnings consistently over the past five years.

# Liquidity

Top stocks typically receive extensive media coverage and are followed by leading Wall Street analysts. This usually means more liquidity, leading to better prices and faster trade executions. Moreover, top stocks with ample liquidity are more difficult for larger players to manipulate, helping to keep a fair and orderly market in them.

# Top-Stock Investing Risks

**Missed Opportunities**  
Investing only in top large-cap stocks means that investors may miss profitable opportunities in other areas of the stock market. Some of the most significant gains come from small-cap stocks under the radar. For example, an unknown small biotechnology company may announce a breakthrough discovery that propels its share price higher. Even if investors favor trading top stocks, allocating a portion of capital to other stock groups helps avoid missing compelling opportunities.  
  
**Trend Reversals**  
The trend is your friend—until it's not. Even top large-cap stocks with a track record of earnings growth and creating shareholder value encounter unforeseen challenges. For example, cruise line companies, such as Carnival Corp. (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH), reported increased revenue in the years leading up to the pandemic but watched their top line sink to unprecedented lows for several years due to no-sail orders and a collapse in passenger demand during the worldwide health crisis.  
  
When investing in top stocks, investors should always use a stop-loss order to protect against sudden trend reversals."
152,"Been Holding FB since IPO, now ready to move on from the Zuck",3,y83iwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y83iwf/been_holding_fb_since_ipo_now_ready_to_move_on/,23,1666188038.0,"I (36 y/o) entered a position at IPO, traded shares at rips and dips up until 2014, and since then basically held majority of my shares. I know I'm late to the game on selling but I'm up 100% as of today and I'm ready to sell the remaining 60 shares as I don't really feel confident in the Zuck and his vision of the company... and with a recession looming I want to free up cash buying power to enter positions in solid companies to set it and forget it. I'm exiting my position before this stock plummets further down. 
I have a decent position in Apple and Tesla, and I entered positions in Amazon and Google when they announced they were splitting. 
I'm looking for recommendations for long term /slow growth companies to invest in heavy over the course of the year/next year. 

I will obviously reinvest into Apple, Google, Amazon, and I even have a sizable position in RIOT (and other crypto mining companies) that I'd like to double down on as btc and the crypto market falls alongside stocks, but I'm interested in entering positions in companies such as Microsoft and any other companies that are projected to be worth more in 10, 20, 30 years. I know no one can tell the future, but I'd love some recommendations on companies people are confident in that will grow over the coming decades, and if possible what prices should I set alerts for. For example I have no clue what price to enter a position in Microsoft, $200? $175?, $150? I know I'm not gonna time any bottoms, and there's a 99.9% chance I'm gonna see red on every share I buy, but if I can get some advice on realistic price targets I'll likely just set ladder buys into positions good for 60 days.

What are thoughts on major companies like Disney, Sony, Nintendo, Nvidia?

Thanks in advance!"

# [S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures jump after Nvidia’s blockbuster quarter: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 jumped Thursday as investors cheered the latest quarterly results from Nvidia. Meanwhile, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid after Fitch Ratings placed the United States’ AAA rating on a negative rating watch.
*****
> S&P 500 futures were up 0.6%, while Nasdaq-100 futures popped 1.9%. Dow futures were down 85 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Nvidia shares surged 27% in the premarket trading after the artificial intelligence beneficiary gave stronger-than-expected revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter, while also reporting beats on the top and bottom line in the previous quarter. Several analysts covering the stock hiked their price targets on the stock following the results.
*****
> Other semiconductor stocks followed Nvidia higher, including AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor, which rose 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 6.2%.
*****
> Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings put the U.S.′ AAA long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on a negative watch. The rating agency said the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations have raised the risks that the government could miss payments on some of its obligations. However, Fitch said it still expects a resolution before the X-date.
*****
> Those moves follow a down day for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday posting a fourth straight day of losses. The 30-stock index dropped 255.59 points, or 0.77%. The S&P 500 ended the day lower by 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.61%.
*****
> Debt ceiling negotiations continued to weigh on the major averages. The talks hit a hurdle earlier Wednesday. Later, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy indicated negotiations were making progress.
*****
> “We play this political game leading up and into the limit,” Atlas Merchant Capital CEO Bob Diamond said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think there’s no question that it would be a terrible, terrible, terrible decision to default for the dollar, for U.S. Treasurys, for our brand and reputation. I think the chances of that happening are extremely light.”
*****
> In corporate earnings, retailers Best Buy, Dollar Tree and Ralph Lauren will report Thursday before the open.
*****
> Traders can expect the second reading on gross domestic product in the first quarter before the open on Thursday, as well as the latest weekly jobless claims data. April pending home sales data is also on deck after the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.8%, up from the decline of 5.2% the prior month.

# [Stock futures fall as investors weigh cross currents of latest earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell Thursday as investors responded to the latest batch of quarterly results and awaited a slew of Federal Reserve speakers.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 192 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also fell 0.6%.
*****
> Retailer Bath & Body Works jumped more than 20% after it beat revenue expectations and doubled what was anticipated for per-share earnings. Cisco was up more than 3% after beating both earnings and revenue estimates. Macy’s popped 8% after surpassing expectations in its third-quarter results.
*****
> The latest moves followed a down day on Wall Street, the second in three days. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.83% and 1.54%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 39.09 points, or 0.12%.
*****
> Downward pressure emerged from weak guidance from Target, which reported a decline in sales as inflation pinches shoppers heading into the holiday season. The Minneapolis-based chain ended 13% lower, while its forward guidance cast doubt on other retailers.
*****
> Target followed better-than-expected reports earlier in the week from Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart, which beat expectations and said inflation was not hitting them as hard.
*****
> “There’s an adjustment process that’s going on,” by companies, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. “I’m not saying that’s a reason to take no action in a portfolio, but trying to chase things usually ends up meaning you’re making a bad decision and then another bad decision and another bad decision.”
*****
> Investors will also watch tomorrow for weekly jobless claims, the latest reports on on October housing starts and building permits, and manufacturing surveys from the Philadelphia and Kansas City Federal Reserve banks.
*****
> Earnings season continues Thursday with additional retailers, including Kohl’s before the bell and Gap after.

156,This is why I held and kept buying Nvidia (NVDA),2,11g2pc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11g2pc2/this_is_why_i_held_and_kept_buying_nvidia_nvda/,31,1677763480.0,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chatgpt-nvidia-30000-gpus

I'm unsurprised by this article, mainly because after researching machine learning systems and platforms, I discovered that Nvidia is *the* leader in the field, and has been almost since its inception.  They lead the industry by about 6 years, and the gap appears to be widening rather than converging.  Pretty much every company that utilizes machine learning has Nvidia as its hardware platform- so that's not just ChatGPT, it's Google, Apple, Tesla, GM, all the big funds experimenting with machine learning trading and forecasting algorithms, pretty much everyone.  And this market is just getting bigger, faster.  People freaked out over gamers not buying because of inflated prices and miners offloading hardware they couldn't use anymore because of restrictions in China, but I was aware an underlying revenue stream was solid and prepared to widen.

Anyone else have pet stocks that outwardly seem like they're getting beat up but have value that isn't really well-known?"

As for how I invest.  I don't trade short term.  All of my investments are long term investments.  IE 10 years or more.  Here are the stocks I took a position in (When I take a position I buy about 1K worth of the stock... nice round number.  I try not to double down unless I really like/believe in something or see a lot of likely potential).  Most of these I have bought very recently as I don't want to get too greedy trying to find the bottom and miss.

Positions: Nvidia (2), Air BnB (1), Amazon (1), Disney (1), Cloudflare (1), Roku (1), Snow (1), TTD (1), TYL (1)

Eyeing Confidently: Shopify, Google

Considering:  Zoom, TEAM, Apple. Upstart  As for why Apple is so low..  I just don't believe it is AS discounted as people say it is... and it isn't far off from having parity growth with the market IMO.  The other 2 have big upside... but I don't know if i fully believe they will bounce back to close to their 2020 levels anytime soon.  As for Upstart... that is a bit of a swing for the fences stock.  I am considering taking a risk by putting a full position into it as opposed to a half or quarter.

How do you like my picks so far during the downturn.  What do you think I should consider or taking off my list?"

160,Tesla stock ($TSLA) sinks as Barclays says it's time 'to move to the sidelines'.,1,14fvfiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14fvfiv/tesla_stock_tsla_sinks_as_barclays_says_its_time/,11,1687414916.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) stock sank 5.5% on Wednesday, its steepest loss in two months, after one analyst on Wall Street cautioned it was time to take some money off the table.  
  
In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near-term questions about the stock’s fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn’t exactly trade on fundamentals — it currently trades at a forward P/E of 80 — Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.  
  
“We believe the stock’s recent rally can be best explained by the market’s current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,” Levy said in his note. “Yet while we aren’t surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.”

Levy’s main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla’s recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and, most importantly, how multiple expansion is really the “entirety of the rally.”  
  
As for AI, the recent run-up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company’s ventures like FSD (full self-driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a “long-dated” opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.

Similarly, Tesla’s charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating “marketing benefits” for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long term, Levy says.  
  
The biggest factor for the \~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla’s near-term fundamentals haven’t changed, and while other AI-related stocks have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn’t the case for Tesla.  
  
Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla’s 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla’s margins are still “uncertain” given recent price cuts, though it is possible margins may have troughed. Finally, more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.  
  
All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla’s prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. “We continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,” Levy says, but “near term fundamentals need to be considered.”"

Anything you don't like? Anything that seems ""risky"" (aside from nvidia)? Anything that might be dragging my portfolio?

IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  
In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.  
Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).

* That would add over $150 billion to the EV giant's total market capitalization.
* Robo-taxis ""could potentially transform society"" and account for over 70% of Tesla's future value, analysts said.

Tesla's market capitalization could soar by over $150 billion thanks to a looming surge in demand for robo-taxis, according to RBC Capital Markets.

The self-driving taxi ""could potentially transform society more than anything else in our lifetimes"" and makeup over 70% of the EV giant's future value, a team of analysts led by Tom Narayan said in a note to clients Thursday.

The Canadian bank lifted its price target for Tesla's stock to $305 – over 19% above the $255.90 shares traded at as of Thursday's close.

Those gains would add another $155 billion to Elon Musk's company's total valuation, by Insider's calculations. Tesla has already seen its market cap surge by over $270 billion in the past month after it struck deals with General Motors and Ford that would allow them access to the EV leader's charging infrastructure.

Tesla should be able to dominate the robot-taxi market given how well-developed its self-driving tech already is, according to RBC.

Narayan's team estimated that Musk's EV maker could achieve a 25% market share in the US, as well as an 8% share in Europe and a 7% share in China.

Tesla's share price is already up 107% in 2023, with the EV maker adding over $300 billion of market cap over the past month alone.

The robo-taxi is the strongest of several factors that will help the stock extend its breakneck rally, according to RBC.

Tesla's early success in its price war and the landmark deals it signed with Ford and General Motors last month could also fuel further gains, the analysts said.

They added that the stock will also benefit from the frenzy for artificial intelligence, which has helped fellow tech giant Nvidia to rack up triple-digit gains and reach a $1 trillion valuation."

7:25 am ET September 28, 2022

**Eli Lilly And Co** (NYSE: LLY) shares are trading higher by 7.60% to $334.75 during Wednesday's pre-market session after **Biogen Inc** (NASDAQ: BIIB) and **Eisai Co. Ltd.** announced late Tuesday positive results from a late-stage study of their Alzheimer’s treatment candidate.

Eli Lilly's donanemab, an investigational antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease, is in trial to treat early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

**What Happened?**

Biogen and Eisai announced Lecanemab treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared with placebo at 18 months by 27%, which represents a treatment difference in the score change of -0.45 (p=0.00005) in the analysis of Intent-to-treat (ITT) population.

The companies said starting as early as six months, across all time points, the treatment showed highly statistically significant changes in CDR-SB from baseline compared to placebo (all p-values are less than 0.01).

In addition, all key secondary endpoints were also met with highly statistically significant results compared with placebo (p<0.01).

""Today's announcement gives patients and their families hope that lecanemab, if approved, can potentially slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and provide a clinically meaningful impact on cognition and function,"" said **Michel Vounatsos**, Chief Executive Officer at Biogen.

My focus is on identifying stocks that have the capacity to shape and embody this vision. Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.  
  
Recently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals. Patience will be crucial since the key lies in retaining their user base into adulthood rather than solely targeting adults at present. This journey will undoubtedly take years. Furthermore, their success is reliant on partnerships with NVIDIA and other hardware manufacturers who can provide the necessary technology. I believe Roblox could be the interface we rely on as AI progresses and 3D/VR technology becomes more advanced.  
  
Considering all this, I seek advice on whether to invest in this company now or wait for future developments, especially if I anticipate Roblox to resemble the fictional 'Innovative Online Industries' from the book Ready Player One. While there seems to be a collective vision for the future, the uncertainty lies in identifying the company that can bring it to life. What are your thoughts on this matter?"

ASML, a similarly important semiconductor company who is also the global leader in its respective field commands a P/E of 37. Nvidia, and AMD also trade at far higher multiples despite being largely dependent on TSM for chips.

The reason TSM is so cheap compared to these other companies is because of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in a Taiwanese company. However, this risk is way overstated on many levels.

#1. China invading Taiwan is nowhere near a certainty.
#2. TSM is building manufacturing plants outside of Taiwan including in Arizona.
#3. Most importantly if China were to invade Taiwan, the entire stock market would drop off a cliff. US involvement and concerns over nuclear war would hit all non military stocks.


In that situation TSM probably falls like 70% but the rest of the market may drop by 30%. Buying a company trading at half its market value is entirely worth it if the biggest risk is that it would lose an extra 40% in value in the event of WW3 starting. 

I don’t know about y’all, but I’d be more worried about getting drafted then I would about my portfolio underperforming the market.

Investing in TSM is like getting 2/1 odds that WW3 won’t happen in the next 10 years. 
If you win you double your money. If you lose, the money is the least of your concerns."

* The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon
* That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.

US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.

According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.

S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.

The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.

But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.

This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""

But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.

Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.

Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks."

**-The acceleration in the chipmaker's growth should help it justify its rich valuation, and its forward P/E ratio suggests that it may not be too overpriced.**  
**-Nvidia has impressive upside potential and could turn out to be a solid long-term pick.**  


**This high-flying stock could be a buy even after eye-popping gains so far in 2023.**

The craze around artificial intelligence (AI) has sent shares of several companies soaring this year. Nvidia ($NVDA) is one of the foremost examples of this trend -- shares of the semiconductor giant have jumped a whopping 180% so far in 2023.

This terrific rally has made shares of Nvidia very expensive as the stock is now trading at 213 times trailing earnings and 39 times sales. Those multiples are significantly higher than Nvidia's already expensive five-year average P/E of 67 and sales multiple of 18. For some more perspective, the S&P 500 has a price-to-sales ratio of 2.45 and earnings multiple of 19.  
  
So, it is safe to say that Nvidia stock is expensive by quite some margin. However, the forward earnings multiple of 52, based on estimates, suggests that the company's earnings are on track to grow at a rapid pace. Nvidia's forward earnings ratio also suggests that the stock is only a tad overpriced when compared to its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 41.  
As a result, it makes sense for investors who are looking to take advantage of the AI boom to consider buying Nvidia even after its red-hot rally. A closer look at the company's prospects will make it clear that it is indeed worth the hype.

  
**Nvidia AI-driven growth is just getting started**

The impact of AI on Nvidia's financial performance became very clear when the company released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results last month. While revenue fell 13% year over year during the quarter that ended on April 30, to $7.2 billion, the company is estimating a 64% year-over-year jump in revenue in the current quarter, to $11 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range.

The data center business is the biggest reason Nvidia expects a solid acceleration in growth in the current quarter, as this segment is benefiting strongly from the adoption of generative AI.  
  
On the company's latest conference call with analysts, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that companies are ""racing to deploy"" Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet growing AI demand. The demand for Nvidia's graphics cards is so strong that the company is reportedly struggling to keep up. Supply issues have reportedly led to a sharp jump in the prices of Nvidia's AI-capable GPUs, with the company reportedly commanding a premium of as much as 40% in China.  
  
The impressive pricing power that Nvidia is enjoying can be attributed to the semiconductor giant's dominant position in the market for AI chips. New Street Research estimates that Nvidia controls a whopping 95% of the market for GPUs that can be deployed for machine learning in data centers. Meanwhile, HSBC estimates that Nvidia enjoys a 90% share of processors used for generative AI applications.  
  
All this indicates that Nvidia is crushing it in the market for AI chips, and it could win big from the same in the long run as the demand for these chips is set to boom even more. Nvidia looks to be at the beginning of a massive growth curve thanks to AI, which should help the company justify its expensive valuation by helping it sustain outstanding growth in the long run.

&#x200B;

**The stock is built for more upside**

Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia  to sustain momentum over the next five years, which is not surprising given the huge opportunity in AI chips discussed above.

Bank of America global research analyst Vivek Arya projects that the adoption of generative AI services could help Nvidia increase its revenue at an annual pace of 25% through 2027. The company is expected to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end in January 2024) with revenue of of almost $40 billion. Assuming it does clock 25% annual revenue growth through the end of 2027 (which will coincide with its fiscal 2028), its top line could jump to nearly $100 billion at the end of the forecast period.  
  
For comparison, Nvidia delivered $27 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023, suggesting that its revenue could nearly quadruple over a five-year period. The stock sports a five-year average sales multiple of 18. While that's rich, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain a similar multiple after five years given its tremendous AI opportunity.  
  
If it keeps that multiple and has $100 billion sales, it would have a market cap of $1.8 trillion. That would be 80% higher than Nvidia's current market cap."

**These chip and industrial stocks have tons of upside potential.**  
No matter how long you've been investing, you've probably heard the phrase ""buy low, sell high."" But it's not that easy. In fact, following this advice can frequently result in money being left on the table. Outsized gains are typically realised over a multi-year period by allowing winning positions to compound. The best companies have a habit of improving their fundamentals until they reach a premium valuation. This has been the case with a company like Apple, which has effectively compounded its earnings (and bought back its stock) to justify a sustained valuation expansion. Nvidia ($NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM), and General Electric ($GE) are three well-known stocks that are currently on fire but may still be worth investing in.

**Nvidia is a smart way to invest in AI**  
Scott Levine (Nvidia): Falling more than 50% in 2022, Nvidia's stock has roared back in 2023. Since the start of the year, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 160%. While the stock had climbed steadily through the first four months of the year, most recently the catalyst behind the stock's rise was a strong first-quarter 2024 earnings report and guidance for Q2 2024. And, despite the stock's meteoric climb this year, there's still reason to believe shares can fly even higher.  
  
In all likelihood, most investors recognize Nvidia for its prowess in graphics processing units (GPUs). What many may not know, however, is that the company is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) -- an area that has exploded in popularity recently thanks to ChatGPT. While Nvidia played a pivotal role in the development of ChatGPT, the company's AI offerings transcend this one AI chatbot.

Thanks to its industry-leading GPUs -- critical components in training AI -- Nvidia is highly sought after by companies developing AI systems. In late March, for example, Nvidia announced that Alphabet's Google Cloud will be the first cloud services provider to use its L4 GPU for assisting in the development of large generative AI models. A variety of other industry leaders also rely on Nvidia for their AI platforms, including AT&T, Oracle, and Adobe.  
  
With Nvidia's recent rise, the stock is trading at a premium. Currently, shares are valued at 68 times forward earnings. With this steep price tag, it wouldn't be surprising if investors choose to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. Over the long term, though, with some analysts forecasting the generative AI market to rise from $11.3 billion to $51.8 billion in 2028, Nvidia is well positioned to see its stock outperform the market -- especially since the company relies on much more than simply its AI solutions to keep the lights on.

**Taiwan Semi has it all**  
Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Shares of Taiwan Semi have rebounded nicely after a brutal 2022. And for good reason. The stock had sold off primarily due to concerns about a slowing economy (which impacts cyclical chip stocks) and Taiwan Semi's geopolitical risk with China. The industry leader now sells for an inexpensive valuation -- sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 (near a 10-year low).  
  
Shares of Taiwan Semi got an additional boost after Nvidia blew expectations out of the water and soared to a new all-time high. While Taiwan Semi doesn't have the direct exposure to AI that a chip company like Nvidia does, it does provide a catch-all way to benefit from a rising tide in AI and robotics.

Taiwan Semi operates a third-party foundry business that receives designs from customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices (among others) and manufactures chips to their specifications. In this vein, Taiwan Semi is one of the more straightforward ways to indirectly benefit from a growing chip industry. Instead of building a new factory and hoping customers come knocking on the door, Taiwan Semi's expansions are more so in response to its customers demanding higher volumes and increasingly sophisticated products.  
  
There's a short list of third-party foundries that can handle a surge in chip manufacturing as a result of AI and other trends -- giving Taiwan Semi a wide moat in addition to massive growth potential. The biggest risk for this company is geopolitical. However, it is combating that risk by expanding outside of Taiwan with a new 4-nanometer fab in Arizona and a sophisticated technology fab in Japan (both are expected to come online in late 2024).   
  
With an inexpensive valuation, industry leadership, growth opportunities, cheap-looking shares, and a 1.9% dividend yield to boot, there's a lot to like about Taiwan Semi stock -- even though it's run up a lot in the last month.

**GE's end markets keep improving**  
Lee Samaha (General Electric): The industrial powerhouse General Electric is up over 55% in 2023 but still has room to run. The reasoning behind this argument is that all three of its end markets continue to improve.   
GE is a much smaller company now than in Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt's heydays. Following the healthcare spinoff early this year, GE is now focused on aerospace (mainly commercial with some defense exposure), power (especially gas turbines and services), and renewable energy (wind power and grid solutions).   
In aerospace, GE continues to enjoy the benefits of the recovery in commercial aerospace and a gradually improving supply chain. GE Aerospace grew orders by 14% in the first quarter, and its joint venture with Safran, CFM International, is on track to ramp up production of its LEAP engines by 50% in 2023. While the LEAP comes with a negative engine margin, it generates highly lucrative aftermarket revenue spread over decades as the engines are used.   
In addition, GE Aerospace may have an opportunity to take market share on the Airbus A320 neo family of aircraft. Its competitor on the airplane, Raytheon Technologies' geared turbofan engine (GTF), has disappointed some airlines with durability issues in harsh environments.   
GE Power is heading for another solid year, with management forecasting low-single-digit revenue growth and ""slightly better"" operating profit than in 2022. However, given that the natural gas price has fallen by 74% over the last year and 33% this year, it's likely that gas turbine usage will increase, leading to more services revenue and a possible increase in investment in gas turbines.   
Finally, the infrastructure bill is unleashing pent-up demand in GE's core market, U.S. onshore. As such, GE Renewable Energy orders rose 94% in the first quarter to $5.4 billion, driven by onshore wind and two large grid solutions orders to connect renewable energy sources to the grid.   
Given the strengthening momentum in its end markets, there's plenty of reason to believe the industrial company could exceed its earnings guidance."

Ive always looked at the prices of both stocks throughout time, even bought one share when they announced a supposedly competitive AI chip and NVIDIA still crushed them.

Whenever I read articles justifying this stock, the reasons to buy are literally the same reason you should buy Nvidia (they’ll be a player in AI, theyre coming out with a new chip); its literally all the same stuff Nvidia does, so what exactly is the competitive edge?

From personal experience, when I used to build PCs, both company’s products had the exact same capabilities, but the Nvidia brand just had stronger recognition so I always opted for them.

I just dont see the point ever buying AMD when you could buy Nvidia, both company’s have been around long enough and if AMD was a true competitor they would have proven so by now."
187,"Stock enthusiasts! I've got some hot firefly AI knowledge to drop on you, and it's all about why Adobe stock is about to skyrocket (I hope)!",0,13zddhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13zddhu/stock_enthusiasts_ive_got_some_hot_firefly_ai/,16,1685799929.0,"Word on the street is that Adobe ($ADBE) has been playing some sly games to maintain its market dominance. Rumor has it they've been strategically seeding the internet with pirated copies of Photoshop, making it a breeze to crack. This tactic has allowed them to establish an iron grip on the industry, while turning a blind eye to the pirates dancing around with their illicit copies. It's no wonder the phrase ""that's Photoshopped!"" has become synonymous with digital trickery. Talk about keeping the competition at bay!  
  
But hold on tight, because there's a game-changer in town. Introducing Firefly AI, the surprise superstar of Photoshop (BETA). This AI-powered tool is an absolute game-changer, my friends. Nothing else out there can match its capabilities right now, and mark my words, it's only going to get better. Brace yourselves for mind-blowing photo mash-ups that will blow your artistic socks off. The momentum it's generating is sending shockwaves through the creative universe!  
  
But wait, there's a catch. Firefly AI isn't letting the pirates hitch a free ride. Nope, it demands a Creative Cloud subscription. This move by Adobe is their way of forcing those pirates to dock their ships and join the legal party. And guess what? The subscription model is the key to their positive revenue. When those earnings reports hit, expect financial fireworks like never before.  
  
Speaking of subscriptions, Adobe has got it all figured out. They've got options for everyone. Choose the cheap version with a cancellation fee (50%) if you bail out before a year, or go for the more expensive one that allows you to cancel whenever you please. They're giving you the flexibility to keep those revenue streams flowing like a mighty river.  
  
Here's the secret sauce: While other AI art companies are drowning in copyright claims, Adobe is sailing through those stormy waters unscathed. How? They own a massive stock gallery that's exclusively theirs. And guess what again? When you've got a Creative Cloud subscription, those little checkboxes that ask if it's okay to send product usage information are automatically checked. It's like an all-access pass for Adobe to make their AI even better, utilizing that data to refine and enhance the Firefly AI experience. Talk about an unfair advantage in the art AI arena!  
  
So, my fellow masters of the stock universe, let's hop aboard our spaceships and ride the Adobe rocket to the moon together. Let's do this!

  
Personally, I bought stocks at $370 and have call options expiring on the 23rd of June with a strike price of $500. I don't see it as the next Nvidia, but hopefully, something joyful will be presented at the earnings call on the 15th of June.

• Generational AI growth is definitely not a panacea, but has started to gain traction as use cases expand beyond ChatGPT.

• Besides, higher performance computing is becoming a must have.

• Its Auto segment is doing extremely well, gaming rebounding, and data center still growing.

• Nvidia's new product innovation and exceptional R&D spend allow it to keep its pole position.

I had recommended NVIDA #NVDA at $116 in Oct 2022 as the best in its class -- on strong product innovations such as the new RTX gaming series, and the Hopper and the Grace in data center. Now, its price has more than doubled to $265, helped by the disinflation rally of January 2023, the expected growth from generational AI A100, AI chips that are being used for Microsoft (MSFT) and AI [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), Inc. (AI) for ChatGPT and then better than expected Q1-FY24 guidance. Those factors from the October article are equally important today; and further growth from autos and AI will sustain the company for several years."

I look at companies like Tesla and Nvidia that could explode upward, but I am loosing interest in investing in stocks tbh. I have bought and sold over 150 different stocks since beginning trading/investing in 2017. I have only bought and sold ETFs 8 times, and every single time having that dividend was awesome, and hey I actually turned a profit with each ETF when I pressed the sell button. 

I am on here asking what stocks should I buy to turn a profit (not including dividends yet) between now and late 2025? My closest friends told me to buy Tesla because it has dipped and will eventually go back up in the coming year. I agree. 

Can anyone on here give me a list of stocks that have a good probability of making money in the next 1 to 3 years if they are bought right now? Or would it be better to wait until the market begins to turn around (most likely in early 2024) before touching ***any*** stocks?"

If this is true and TESLA gets a price to sales of 50-75 for being AI company, what will the market cap be?  Puts us around 4 trillion at todays revenue.     


If AI takes off we might be around 10-30 trillion valuation, the low side of what some youtubers were claiming.

192,"This AI stock jumped 163% this year, and Wall Street thinks it can rise another 50%. is that realistic?",0,14k6fct,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14k6fct/this_ai_stock_jumped_163_this_year_and_wall/,5,1687849983.0,"\- This AI stock has quintupled over the past 18 months.  
\- And yet, it still only trades at 20 times earnings.  
\- That's not expensive if the company can meet the CEO's projections, and Wall Street is coming around to agree.  


This hardware stock may seem overextended, but there's a very plausible path higher.  
Investors in leading cloud and semiconductor stocks have probably seen big gains this year, as the artificial-intelligence (AI) revolution sparked by the introduction of ChatGPT last November began translating into blockbuster revenue and profit gains for well-positioned companies this spring.  
  
While many have homed in on GPU leader Nvidia ($NVDA), cloud giant Microsoft, or more speculative software bets like C3.ai, one company in the less well-regarded server market has also been a huge winner.  
Super Micro Computer ($SMCI) has carved out a very attractive niche for itself within the AI industry, and the stock has climbed 163% in 2023. But what's even more impressive is that, unlike some other tech stocks that were down in 2022, Super Micro is achieving these gains after rising nearly 87% last year -- and remember, that was in a year in which the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) fell more than 30%!  
Although the stock has nearly quintupled in a mere 18 months, one Wall Street analyst recently upgraded Super Micro while raising her price target to $325 -- about 50% higher than shares sit today.  
That may seem laughable to some, but unlike some other AI plays that seem extremely expensive, there's a perfectly reasonable case for Super Micro to reach that target and even surpass it.

**Loop Capital is all in on SMCI's ""Legos""**  
On June 14, research firm Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised her price target on Super Micro Computer from $200 per share to $325, indicating a roughly 50% gain from the stock's current level.  
In her note, Baruah said Loop's work suggests that ""the Gen AI compute build has both legs and commercial commitment, with Gen AI going to 30%-40% of all Hyperscale applications from less than 5% today."" Within the generative AI megatrend, Baruah especially likes Super Micro Computer because of its unique ""complexity at scale"" building block model, which Baruah believes has at least a 12- to 24-month lead over the competition.

What is the building block business model? At a recent conference hosted by Rosenblatt Securities, Super Micro founder Charles Liang describes the strategy of building servers as if by ""Legos,"" with each component optimized for quality, functionality, cost, and integration, which can be formed into a myriad of customized server designs.   
  
As opposed to other server companies that mass-produce standard models, customers can optimize Super Micro's server systems based on the end application. And with the proliferation of not just artificial intelligence but also 5G, edge computing, and the Internet of Things, customers appear to be hungry for customized solutions that can be delivered quickly at scale.  
In fact, Loop had mentioned this large-scale customization advantage in its previous note on May 24, when it had initially raised its price target on Super Micro to $200 from $150. In that note, Baruah said that while AI is the most important and prominent catalyst, ""Super Micro's core value-add is deep server customization providing a differentiated impact for increasingly strategic applications, including AI/ML \[machine learning\], Data Analytics, Strategic Video Streaming, etc.""

**And don't forget the advantages of green computing**  
Loop isn't the only research firm that's bullish on Super Micro's prospects from here, either. Earlier in June, Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann initiated coverage on the company with a $300 price target, implying about 40% upside from current levels.  
Mosesmann also noted the mass-customized building block model but is also bullish on Super Micro's ""green computing"" ethos, whereby the company touts its servers as the most energy-efficient in the industry. While ""green computing"" used to be a nice-to-have feature, in the world of AI, it's much more important. Leading-edge chips require tremendous amounts of electricity to run and also generate large amounts of heat, which requires some way to cool the chips. Since cooling systems require space and electricity in and of themselves, this increases the electricity and square footage needs of AI data centers even further.  
Mosesmann wrote in his June note that Super Micro's new liquid cooling technology can increase rack compute power by over two times, which Mosesmann describes as ""a disruptive dynamic in a power constrained data center.""  
So while Super Micro isn't in the business of designing highly specialized proprietary semiconductors, its novel server architecture also contributes to increasing the computing power of AI data centers, albeit by more indirect means.

**A plausible path to $325**  
Even after quintupling, Super Micro trades at only around 20 times earnings, and those earnings incorporate a weak non-AI server market, as well as supply constraints for AI chips that limited Super Micro's growth last quarter.

Analysts have consistently underestimated Super Micro's growth over the past few years and are still only forecasting modest earnings growth in the year ahead for some reason. Yet Charles Liang sees the company growing ""at least"" 20% in the upcoming fiscal year, starting July 1.  
If Super Micro can maintain a 20% earnings growth rate over the next few years, that would amount to a PEG ratio of just 1. That's actually fair or even cheap for a technology stock, which means Loop's $325 target is certainly attainable in the year ahead.
