If he purchased long term calls a year or two ago, and they were set to expire soon, it's logical that he may exercise them regardless of what is going on in the world... seems strange that this is blowing up. This easily could be a weird coincidence.

Don't get me wrong, I hate congress insider trading more than most, but this seems like purposeful misinformation to spread a narrative. He didn't go out and buy 20,000 shares. He exercised 200 call options, which we don't know how long he has held or when they are expiring.",t3_w2x1ts,1658255157.0,111

If the reporting is correct, design wouldn’t be subsidized bc it doesn’t require the sort of capex that manufacturing does—and US companies (the aforementioned) are already designing them here, so chip design isn’t a nat sec priority like manufacturing is.

So unless the bill changes to benefit NVDA, I’m not sure this is actually an example of insider trading.

“When appealing the CMA’s substantive decision in a merger case, a judicial review standard applies, meaning the applicant must show that the CMA acted irrationally, illegally or with procedural impropriety. The CAT will not engage with the merits of the CMA’s decision or conduct a wholesale review of the parties’ evidence. In practice this means that applicants face a high threshold when seeking to overturn a merger decision, which is reflected in the statistics: the CMA has won 67% of all merger appeals since 2010.”

“Even if an applicant successfully appeals the CMA’s substantive assessment in a merger, the CAT will not make a fresh decision, but will instead remit the case back to the CMA for further review –typically by the same decision makers and case team as previously. This may not be an attractive prospect, particularly if the deal economics or environment have changed since the transaction was first signed (months or years previously).”

The survey results showed that 44% of the members believed in astrology, 51% believed in biorhythms, and 56% believed in the existence of extraterrestrial visitors. Stanovich argued that these beliefs have no valid evidence and thus might have been an example of dysrationalia.\[1\]: 503  Sternberg countered that ""No one has yet conclusively proven any of these beliefs to be false"", so endorsement of the beliefs should not be considered evidence of dysrationalia.\[5\] Stanovich's rebuttal to Sternberg explained that the purpose of the example was to question the epistemic rationality of the process by which people arrived at their unlikely conclusions, a process of evaluating the quality of arguments and evidence for and against each conclusion, not to assume irrationality based on the content of the conclusion alone.\[7\]""

The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms.  It's an extremely artificial definition.  It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors *in general* - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.

No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that *more* of the people you tell to do this will *lose* than if you had just held your tongue.",t3_13rxgz6,1685139798.0,1
1305,jlr8t1v,t1_jlr60zo,">We don't just skip to the conclusion and take it at face value, my friend. We read the methodology, and think about what was done.

You've done nothing of the sort. You highlighted the one paragraph that had a downside and declared victory like a child. 

>The article defines what it means by ""outperform"" in pretty clear terms. It's an extremely artificial definition.

What definition wouldn't be extremely artificial? Should Moses walk down from a mountain with the definition carved into tablets by lighting? 

>It rests on a number of fallacious assumptions, as well as other assumptions that for better or worse simply don't apply to investors in general - risk neutrality and the ability to have perfect psychological discipline, for example.

Again, this is irrelevant to the argument about performance. If your argument is that people shouldn't LSI because psychologically they can't handle then fine, but that is not what you said and it is a pretty obvious end run around the fact that ""statistically speaking"" LSI generates better returns. 

>No, my argument is that individuals never experience the average, and the paragraph I showed you in which LSI was net lossy in more periods than DCA is 

This is the type of argument that would lead you to invest in nothing but treasury bonds.

>the statistical evidence you should be paying attention to, because as you spray this advice around what it is saying is that more of the people you tell to do this will lose than if you had just held your tongue.

Good point, let's tell them to put in under a mattress. That'll do them good. If your sole goal is minimization of nominal losses you shouldn't be investing into any stock... ever. Is that your proposal? 

>All of which should give you pause before making the additional conclusion, which the article does not make, which is that ""everyone should LSI"".

Who has ever said everyone should LSI? I haven't, the person you got into this argument didn't, the article didn't... So who are you even arguing with on this point?",t3_13rxgz6,1685141103.0,1

Should be noted that pulling out of the UK doesnt mean that MSFT wont still have business there. They can still sell all their products. What they wont be able to do is manufacture, or service them there. They would need to let some 3rd party do the services and that party will just pay them for licenses in USD instead.

Gamers dont care about politics very much. They will buy the games they like. And there is no other practical option if you are still running managed enterprise desktops.

I.e. they are not interested in monitoring if Microsoft is doing every thing it promised. In 2019 two reports came out basically saying previous behavioural remedies especially for digital/tech mergers were under enforced. They promised things they didn't do and no one bothered stopping them

This is from a speech by the head of the CMA earlier this year. 

>On behavioural remedies, we have been clear that the bar to show that such a remedy can address a competition concern is high, for 2 reasons.

>First, a behavioural remedy does not typically address the underlying causes of the competition concerns identified by the CMA - instead it seeks to manage market outcomes by controlling the behaviour of the merged entity for a period of time. As such, it may involve arrangements that the parties would not enter into under normal commercial circumstances. And once the remedy expires, the underlying causes of the concern may remain and then have a significant effect on competition.
Second, even where a behavioural remedy might in theory be capable of restoring competitive outcomes in a market, there are many practical challenges to designing an effective behavioural remedy.
These concerns are not theoretical – they are supported by case study research.[8] One particular challenge is that a remedy can become ineffective or be circumvented as market conditions change, particularly in a sector where technology or business models are changing quickly. Another is that the monitoring and implementation of behavioural remedies can be very challenging, particularly given that there are information asymmetries between suppliers and customers.

>Some of these difficulties can be mitigated, of course, by the use of mechanisms such as monitoring trustees or fast-track arbitration. But if those mechanisms aren’t effective, the remedy will fail to work properly, or the CMA may end up in the role of a referee in a market for an extended period of time. It is not clear that a remedy that led to that sort of outcome could be viewed as an intervention that has served to prevent the lessening of competition, compared to the position absent the merger",t3_13ia8cg,1684168976.0,5

Circling back to this specific topic, let me ask you a question.  Do you think the merging of the two largest US video game producers is good or bad for the American consumer?  Additionally,  how do you think this will effect the next largest company, EA, which would now be in competition with a company that dwarfs its output two times over?",t3_13ia8cg,1684187845.0,7
1583,jk97ebe,t1_jk95dqy,"I feel like you missed the point.  My question didnt state they are the market winner.  Im asking why do we inevitably le them grow to the point we then need to break them up.   

Yes, there are 4 notable companies in this space in the US, after the merger there would be 3, with microsoft/Activision dwarfing the next largest us competitor by almost 2,5x.  Worldwide there are around a dozen viable competitors.  So essentially we're saying let's let US companies combine, heading towards monopolies because this is the best way to compete internationally?  Additionally there are vertical monopolies, which history shows doesn't work well for the consumer.  They're promising they won't restrict software to their platform.  Ok, and once the merger goes through and they do?  We hit them with a tiny fine?",t3_13ia8cg,1684169899.0,7

Monopolies have been shown to be bad time and time again and you're here saying unelected bureaucrats shouldn't try to prevent monopolies forming in emerging industries? Microsoft doesn't absolutely need to acquire ABK, it doesn't really matter. But the potential for a monopoly in cloud gaming, which Microsoft has indicated they are going all in on, would be extremely damaging to the consumer so the regulators are trying to prevent that from happening. 

I think the regulators at the CMA and the EU, who both agree about the cloud gaming monopoly, know more about this and have more reasonable takes, than some random redditors. 

Your point about Japan makes no sense as the uk has little in the way of massive gaming companies. The big three are Sony xbox and Nintendo, none of which are uk companies so I don't know what point you're trying to make there.

Right now Sony is absolutely dominating the high end console market (riding on their overwhelming success from the previous generation) and as a result they've been able to get away with working a lot less hard to please consumers and it has had a noticeably negative impact on consumers.  Allowing Xbox to increase their IP / Developer roster through this deal increases the likelihood that they're able to compete on even footing with Sony thus resulting in a fiercer fight to hold onto industry market share which let me once again emphasize is good for consumers.

It's absolutely absurd to act like anytime a company gets bigger it automatically means monopoly, you WANT underdog companies to get bigger.  Anti-Trust laws aren't about keeping companies small, they're ensuring fervent competition since generally the fiercer the competition the greater consumers prosper.  And the Console Market is the real concern here, NOT the Cloud market despite what some regulators claim.  I've already stated how small it is, and any future it has is FAR off like several decades (these weak ten year deals won't do crap).  Besides these extra games would have virtually zero impact on how strong a presence Microsoft will have in the market, the issue here is that Amazon and Google (who can match Microsoft's server infrastructure) have little expertise on Gaming within their companies to properly compete, and Sony and Nintendo don't have the server infrastructure to compete.

In regards to the EU agreeing with their concerns, to some degree but they clearly didn't consider it that big of a concern considering how small the concessions were that they asked for.   Also you're acting like holding a high position in government automatically means someone is qualified to pass judgment in some completely unrelated field.  They have to make a guess based off the information they're presented and that's if they can even properly take in the information (which clearly they haven't fully been able to do). These people are old and out of touch, there are some concepts you can try to explain to an old person and no matter how many times you do it just doesn't get through to them due to them simply not growing up in the proper era surrounded by the subject matter.   They are also unelected and working in government, often that's because these kinds of people were too incompetent to actually make it in the private sector or to win a vote.  Finally they have shown a gross misunderstanding of the industry at many different points throughout this whole ordeal.  By your logic if for example women complain about some archaic abortion ruling a bunch of 80 year old men make in congress, I can just go well given their position I'm sure they know more about this than a bunch of random women on Reddit.  Not really, they just happen to be the ones in the authority to make said decision.

I think you misunderstand what the CMA is. Are you British? They are not the government. Regulators in the UK are generally quite separate from the government. Often people in the regulators are heavily involved in the industry they are regulating and your claim that it's people too incompetent to work in industry is just utterly nuts conjecture.

Your entire viewpoint is so heavily based on biased viewpoints with zero evidence. The notion that the workers were too incompetent to work in industry, the notion that the cma is full of old people uninvolved in the industry, that Microsoft is somehow an underdog and them acquiring a huge publisher would only put them on even footing with Sony.

Xbox already has vastly more resources than PlayStation. They have more studios but they squander everything they have. Microsoft does not need an acquisition to compete with Sony, it needs to restructure xbox because they've thrown away so many hard hitting IPs like Halo and gears of war. They have no really successful recent big games despite having so many more studios than Sony.

An acquisition is absolutely not required for xbox to compete. Sony is doing better because they've managed to focus on the right types of games for the mass market, and capitalise on Xbox's mistakes like the Kinect in the 360/1 era.",t3_13ia8cg,1684223395.0,1

The CMA is technically Independent but let's be real here not really there's plenty of cross over in the people working there and also the government can absolutely mess around with their process hence the recent talk about the PM working on applying pressure on them.

Also what do you mean ""so many more studios"".  A measly four more (23 compared to 19) is so many lmao?  Also size and quality matters a lot.  Also there's non-owned partner studios that play a big role too.

1659,ijd102g,t3_wil6gp,"Corporations will not pay the tax in the end. Consumers, hence taxpayers will. Inventors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs got to where they are because they paid the price up front by risking their own livelihood and welfare, innovating, sacrificing their resources up-front, leading others to produce, etc. They gathered others, the people, to become employees, because those employees obviously couldn’t and still can’t do what they did to get to where they are. The workers, the people, the consumers, the ones that the companies employed, got them there, but it was the leaders/owners of those companies that hit the employees there. Corporations begin with one to a few determined people. It will be the people, the employees, the workers, that will keep the companies running by paying taxes for those companies. Yes, those same employees will pay the taxes on behalf of the companies. The money will just be redistributed by politicians, lawmakers, scam artists, liars, thieves, they are. Democrats never get the fact that corporate heads aren’t idiots. That’s right. We all know The Democratic Party is the “tax more, toll more, and take more party.” Businesses will move their companies out of the country, or just sell to foreign investors and cash out. Read Atlas Shrugged. Producers quit when their resources are taken. Champions stop playing the game when you make rules so that “everyone wins.” If they stay in business after being levied a 15% corporate tax, they will increase prices to cover inflation, thus driving inflation higher. A friend of ours showed us a receipt from a restaurant last weekend that had a new charge on it, “Temporary Inflation Fee.” Hmm. Who’s paying that? The restaurant? No the customer is. The rich are rich because they are always smart to figure out how to get out of paying more, whether it be taxes or more for their raw materials, if they are manufacturers. If restaurants pay more for food and fuel, they increase prices. As stupid as Trump was and is, he said something very honest that every successful business tycoon knows, but doesn’t have the balls to say, “Paying less taxes doesn’t make me a bad person. It makes me smart.” Do you want to give more of your money to the US government and let them manage it? Really. How good of a job have they been doing the last 20 years or so? We would be in jail if we stole like they do. The deficit is like an out of control water meter, spinning endlessly. The hydrant is open full blast and it’s flowing dollars with high pressure. WE are the source of those dollars. The American workers. So, WE will pay those corporate taxes. Not the corporations. Votes to raise taxes are votes to speed up the bleeding process toward the death of a democracy. Free childcare, healthcare, education, job training, food, gas, housing, etc, etc. Free? Who’s paying the bill? We are. We’re paying with our freedom to generate more money by giving more tax money to dishonest, disloyal, and disgusting people. Remember something…”Companies make money. Politicians take money.” Politicians produce nothing, but policies filled with words. Words that further enslave the ones “for whom the policies are written.”",t3_wil6gp,1659907786.0,0

1. How would the corporate minimum tax work?  
Companies with at least $1 billion in income would be required to calculate their annual tax liability two ways: one using longstanding tax accounting methods, which is 21% of profits less deductions and credits; the other by applying the 15% rate to the earnings they report to shareholders on their financial statements, commonly known as book income. Whichever amount is greater would be what they owe.  
  
2. Why are there different ways to calculate income?

They can pass tariffs along to the consumer, because that way they keep their profits up. If the profits are directly taxed, it doesn't help passing the costs along because you are still having to pay taxes on the profits.

A company can choose to lower their prices, thereby reducing profit. So they will be paying less taxes. A company can choose to lose some income by paying taxes (for which they do not see a direct return), or they can choose to lose some income by having lower prices, for which they might increase their market share.

>All this will do is hollow out the middle class by crushing the small to medium sized businesses, leaving only the richest corporations who can afford to operate on thin profits. When businesses are more profitable, it actually results in greater net revenues, and invites more competition into the space working balancing out market share even more.

That's completely wrong. The tax only applies to companies making huge profits. The minimum tax is 15%. Any company turning a profit and not even paying 15% in taxes, should be eradicated anyway. Small and medium sized companies are usually paying much more than 15% in taxes, since they do not have very expensive lawyers, accountants and financial setups dedicated to avoid paying taxes. So this makes no difference to smaller companies. If anything, it levels the playing field compared to the huge companies.

>I wouldn't have thought that destroying profits would be pitched as a sound economic idea in an investing sub, but here we are.

It's not destroying profits, it's making companies pay a a minimum of taxes on their profit. This is a sound idea because a) the government needs money to function, b) most people on here are human beings that need a functioning government, c) it should mean less taxes on citizens, d) companies generating huge profits, profiting from our society, should be made to pay back something instead of just exploiting.",t3_wil6gp,1659943870.0,1

 ""One reason some entities pay little in corporate income tax is the deliberate design of the U.S. tax system, which includes
specific provisions that reduce corporate taxes, referred to as *tax expenditures*. These provisions produce a substantial
revenue loss relative to the yield of the corporate tax. U.S. corporate taxes relative to worldwide income may also be low
because some income is earned abroad, and thus subject to foreign taxes. Various measures are in place to prevent double
taxation of that income, including a credit for foreign taxes paid. Income for tax purposes as compared to income reported to
shareholders (i.e., book income) can also differ due to limits on the deduction of net operating losses.""

""Corporate profits measured in NIPA are generally higher than income subject to tax. For large corporations, the differences
between book income adjusted for tax consolidation rules and tax income (income before net operating losses and special
deductions, or exclusions for nontaxed entities), referred to as book-tax differences, vary with the business cycle. Although
tax income is generally smaller, financial income can be lower during downturns. Book income has been greater than tax
income in recent years.""

>Which one is it? If it’s number 2 then capitalism doesn’t exist

It's both and capitalism exists just fine because of that fact. 

Here's your issue: basic economics will tell you price is dependent on supply & demand which while true is only 100% in a perfectly competitive market which is a market where producers cannot exercise any control over the price and are not differentiated from their competitors. For example, corn at supermarket is generally an example of perfect competition because most don't care where it came from, how it was grown, and focus on price. 

We, for the most part, operate in an imperfect competitive market which means producers DO have some control over price and have differentiated themselves from their competitors meaning factors other than price impact the consumers decision. Cell phones for example would be an imperfect market as some people care about price and some care about brand and others care more about features. Thus, producers CAN raise their price, to a degree, and maintain operations and maintain sales levels..

Now, I've purposefully left out the concept of marginal cost but it's not as important when it comes to pricing because it's essentially just the bottom dollar a producer will sell at in perfect competition.

A firm could have to mark down book income in one year for an expense that it would be able to deduct for tax purposes the following year.

>Basically - because brands matter to people, producers can raise their prices and the market can sustain those prices.

That's an entirely different question. Supply and demand is the most fundamental idea in economics because it describes human behavior in regards to a supply of *like for like* products, but factors *other than price* impacting a consumers decision means we need to use a different supply curve with its own behavior.

E.g. for organic apples, given supply X, demand will be Y, resulting in a price of P.

We cannot apply the same relationship with supply X to non-organic apples, because we're now considering a completely different supply level B.

Let's say the demand for organic apples is higher than non-organic apples, and have a higher price. We can't say that because these prices are different for the same product, the supply/demand model is broken, because the perceived quality (demand) and supply of each products are different and so the supply/demand curve of each behaves in their own way.

I get what you're saying and it's an important thing to think about, but I think it would be better applied when studying bubbles, or product differentiation (branding like you mentioned) instead of how supply/demand behaves.",t3_wil6gp,1659931177.0,0

1. aside from crypto and AI, in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'? Because if so, then once the AI craze calms down, perhaps the value of GPU makers would still shine again in future uses.

2. Would it be possible in future that GPU would somehow have their names changed, since their use would reach far other than graphics processing?

Nvidia has become a huge banana tree in the jungle (reached a $1 trillion market cap), joining an exclusive club of only a few other giant trees, mostly in the tech forest.  
  
Why has Nvidia grown so much? They've been growing a ton of shiny, attractive bananas (producing high-demand GPUs) that are important for both gaming and artificial intelligence platforms. As more monkeys (consumers) see the value of these bananas, they've been clamoring to get them.  
  
Plus, Nvidia's latest batch of bananas (earnings report) was even bigger and better than what most monkeys expected, which has made this tree even more attractive. Nvidia also predicted it'll grow even more bananas ($11 billion in sales) in the future.  
  
As a result, many other banana trees in the chipmaking part of the jungle have also grown bigger. However, not all trees have been so fortunate. Intel, for instance, has been facing some challenges and hasn't grown as much as others.

Neural networks involve a ton of matrix multiplication which is why GPUs are suitable for this task. Nvidia’s main product aside from GPUs is their toolkit that allows you to run code on the GPU. While AMD has a competing solution for their own GPUs it definitely has not picked up as much usage as compared to Nvidia. 
2.	We’re always going to need computer graphics so I don’t think the name will change. We might see more specialized accelerators for doing AI compute (such as TPU) but graphics will always be there.",t3_13vr1zd,1685457719.0,23
2233,jm9ecam,t1_jm7fro6,"> in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'?

The GPU is a parallel computing processor, the point is to give it large chunks of data and run the same (relatively straight forward) operation over each data point all at once instead of one at a time in order, which is how a CPU works. Graphics just happens to be the first major application they were used for, as you need to calculate the color of each individual pixel but the functions for doing so don't really need to worry about what the other pixels are doing.

There are a lot of applications of this kind of computing, and it's only going to get more prevalent as technology advances and gets more data hungry. You also missed physics simulations, which GPUs have been used for for quite a while as well.

> just like 'hard disks' are still names used for hard drives in general, even though SSD has no disks anymore.

I expect the GPU to retain their names, but more specialized parallel processing units to eventually become more common. Crypto mining already has some options that are more purpose built, and I'd expect eventually more focused cards that only support compute shaders and not really the rest of the graphics pipeline to become available, though that might largely just be a difference in firmware, so it might not be worth having multiple models.

Shaders is probably the legacy term that will stick around even if specialized cards get more common. And btw, hard drives is actually a bad example of this, because a ""hard disk drive"" specifically refers to a disk drive - if you're using ""hard disk"" over ""hard drive"" for an SSD, that's just the wrong terminology.",t3_13vr1zd,1685484603.0,1

Unfortunately, all three companies are WAY overvalued right now and buying into any of them is dangerous as F. Trust me, I'd love to buy into all three of them myself. 

I still own some Nvidia, but I'm looking for an exit really soon. I recently sold my AMD because the valuation is getting out of hand and I don't believe it's sustainable.

I don't have a position in MSFT, but I'd love to have one. Problem is, I'm not buying it near it's all-time high. It's gone on a tremendous run, and right now isn't a good time to buy imo.

I still think there's going to be some bad news coming to these markets soon enough. Multiple red days strung together. I'd rather consider buying one of these three then.

Of course, it's tough to sit on the sidelines watching these puppies pop 5 percent every day. But each day that it keeps happening, makes it more likely that it's going to crash in the other direction soon

2261,jm7y033,t1_jm7o863,"I find it ridiculous that you get downvoted lol - probably people don't like mentioning of ETFs in /r/stocks (yes, they exist).

Personally I'm in a very similar situation like yours, even my current profit magin is like yours. Only difference being that I own SMH but they are similar anyway.

After pondering a lot, I decide not to sell, for a few reasons:

1. We who own an ETF with NVDA in it, should have a totally different mindset from people owning NVDA directly. For people who own NVDA it's truly their once in a life time to profit a ton from selling it. If NVDA truly popped, there is a chance that they may never get the same price ever again. For you and I however, the semiconductor sector is here to stay. There is no rush for us to sell it now, as even if NVDA popped, we may still have some profit (although lower) caused by the other holdings.

2. If we sell the ETF, we are not only selling that 10% of Nvidia, but also selling the other 90% of non-Nvidia holdings. We don't know whether AMD or ASML or TSM will have a spike tomorrow or next year, but if you sell the ETF, you will lose the potential gains from the other holdings.

3. My own strategy is to passively DCA and own ETFs on a long term including sector ETFs (like a riskier boglehead), exploiting the strategy of 'time in the market' to the max. I also believe that semiconductor, however volitate the industry is, is a great long-term investment - I believe that even in the event that NVDA becomes the next Intel, the sector is still here to stay. If I decide to sell it now, it will create the first crack in my own strategy and belief, and may even tempt myself to go into riskier endavor. I prefer to have bit more principle and patience. 

4. I have no use of extra cash right now, nor any good idea where to invest the profit anyway.

Finally, in your case, you may have tax problems if you sell too. 

So that's my own thought. Also to consider: people are enthusiastic because they can sell them at 100~200% of profit, so it's way more important for them rather than our measly 25% of profit lol.",t3_13vr1zd,1685464317.0,15

Seriously. Nobody should be buying into or shorting NVDA between about $365 and $450. You could potentially jump in there as a swing trader with a stop loss, but you have to be prepared to take your loss. You can't just ride it.

If you really want to ride Nvidia for a long time, you need a WAY better entry. I'm telling you, I don't know what your current cost basis is, but if you have a chance to get out at break even or a slight profit, you should take that opportunity and then just wait.

Wait for it to fall enough where accumulation actually makes sense, or wait for it to spike high enough that shorting makes sense. Right now, nothing makes sense. In fact, even trying to swing it or daytrade it doesn't make any sense. (reason being, it's too expensive). It's around $380 or so last I checked and a 5 percent move would mean that the stock is moving 19 dollars. That's just for a 5 percent move.

That’s not even technically accurate now. It’s very close though and Nvidia is pricing a lot of it’s products as it were a monopoly which leaves a lot of space e for disruption. What makes you think that won’t change in the next 5 years?

It’s a relatively new field so be 99% that the same player will keep dominating it forever seems strange. After all the barrier for entry is quite low nowadays compared to e.g. the datacenter CPU market back in the 00s or 10s

Trainium which is optimized to train machine learning models and Inferentia which is optimized for inferencing; basically, once your models are trained, inferencing is what allows the model to provide predictions to the client.  

One big issue right now with a lot of AI is that the information you submit is incorporated into their future data set.  This is not a big deal if you're a college kid asking ChatGPT to write your History 101 paper, but it's a disaster if you're a Siri engineer asking ChatGPT to optimize your code and now ChatGPT has the source code to Siri.  

I imagine going forward, large companies will maintain their own localized ML training data/models to avoid that sort of data leak.  That means they're going to have to build out their own data centers and it gets expensive!  ChatGPT apparently costs $700k a day to run at about $.36 per question.  I believe they are currently running on nVidia GPUs for both training and inferencing. 

Trainium claims to increase throughput by 30% and Inferentia claims to reduce the cost per inference by 45%.  How they get there, is technically beyond my understanding.

Hardware sales isn't even what most Nvidia believers think will drive future revenues though, people think it's all about selling compute capacity in datacenters for AI stuff.  This is a very indirect way of making money though, because the value proposition is much more complicate.  Every dollar spent by some business on AI research, model training, or execution, is just a cost component of some larger more expensive thing, so it takes a lot more consumer spending for Nvidia to get $1 from that vs just selling a useful thing to a person. 

I don't see how it makes any sense for Nvidia revenue to grow 4x in the next decade.  $400/year per household for all 123 million US households, and assuming this is 50% of global revenue, would be around $100 billion/year in revenue globally, or about 4x their current revenue.  It's easy to see how Apple collects that much and 3x more from each household and provides good value for it.  It's much harder to see how Nvidia can pull in that kind of revenue and actually provide something to business when then in turn provide something to consumers that is both far more expensive and delivers more value.",t3_12buzi8,1680682688.0,5

What they do have is a VERY powerful brand, with tons of loyalty and consumers are sort of divided into factions over their shit and a couple others.

They have captured probably near unbreakable loyalty for a full generation of consumers who are unlikely to change factions. A competitor could appear with a hot new brand that hits just right with the next gen of tech users, teens, and young adults buying their own stuff for the first time rather than what their parents provide. Apple could concievably become stale for a future generation of consumers, when having a boring old IpHoNe just isnt cool anymore.

Income down 72% in a year for a company of NVDA's size is nuts. That level of cyclicality is typically heavily discounted in the earnings multiple, which if you think is bad now, just wait until that E comes down.

Plus what's the bull case here? Is crypto about to bounce back or something? And even if it does isn't proof of stake a thing now?

I've been saying this is a $120 stock for some time now, but honestly after this earnings report I'm not sure I'd buy for $120. If I thought this was as bad as it's going to get then, then fine, but even if they turn this thing around tomorrow it would still be trading at a huge market premium.

As Data Center is now a massive share, they will have easy calendar year 2023 YoY comps. If gaming recovers in calendar year 2023, the YoY comps will be insane.

Also in outlook was the weak next quarter was due to preparing for NVDA's new generation product. Depending on how good their next gen is, the following quarter may be massive. 

Basically bad headline numbers for this quarter and next, however upside catalysts are there.

It is not a secret. This is not some type of secret investment where only insiders know something.

This is why you hold onto great companies for the long term. The playbook for investing is simple, obviously difficult to execute, but the actual rules of Buffett-style investing are not complicated.

|Net Income|4.2bn  (536% growth YoY)|0.66bn|

Most people were worried and skeptical of NVDA's valuation, but they are growing into it.17bn in net income over the next 4 quarters, at their pre-ER market cap of 750bn, would mean NVDA was trading at 44 PE. Now it's trading at 53 PE.

Not right, until we can produce our needs and not rely on Taiwan making 60% of the worlds chips and 90% of the advanced one's we cannot replicate, yet, demand will keep soaring. Intel, AMD, Semiconductors, the list goes on. This will help fix, over time, the lagging chips we need to make more vehicles. I'm hoping that, should China actually invade and we don't stop them quick enough, Taiwan just hands us the plans and destroys their manufacturing plant's. We cannot let China control the Chip market, period, so imo I think those variables will extend this for a bit longer.

I know at least one Intel Plant here in the US that had a 3x12 & 4x12 alternating schedule (7x 12 hour days and 7 days off every 14 days).   Didn't seem too bad, and  might be ideal for quite a few people.

TSMC apparently also has this requirement:

They are obviously an established company. Doesn't mean that they will be able to keep up in the future. You were talking about its stock going to skyrocket. It will not skyrocket as Nvidia or AMD did, because it just simply doesn't have the culture right now to do that.

I'm listening to Intel's employees. Are they wrong? To have a company that can innovate you need proper culture.

> You say they have a slow chip culture but they still outperform amd in performance, so what the f do you mean really? They are the top chip manufacturer on the planet.

I'm talking about their ability to manuever and innovate now. That's what's important if you want the stock to skyrocket. Even if they have built good stuff, it doesn't mean they will keep building it, or that they are in a state to do so. Companies are easily stagnating due to poor leadership and management.

> They are the top chip manufacturer on the planet.

You are talking about current state. And that's long been priced in. You were implying the stock is going to skyrocket. For stock to skyrocket, they must come out with something special and not rest on their laurels.

> I read like 20 articles a day about these companies, I understand that some sites and articles are paid, I understand what companies out of these three live on hype, momentum and ignorance of non techy wannabe tech people. It takes time to understand the whole market. Amd and nvidia are great at promoting.

That's why I don't trust any random articles, and I'll try to figure out what's going on in the inside, from the people who work there. Blind for example is an anonymous site, but with verification process using the company's email. To me it's one of the best places to get understanding of what's going on inside a company. If someone says they are from Intel there, you can be sure that at least at some point they had access to an intel.com e-mail address.

> Now your saying nvidia pays more etc. Wich i dont buy at all

Nvidia pays at least 25-40% more to engineers. That's just data from Blind. All talent is going to Nvidia.

You can find countless topics talking about Intel vs Nvidia.

Example:
https://www.teamblind.com/post/Intel-CEO-UWzakt0S

Nono you dont understand, and thats OK. Almost nobody does. This isnt that type of forum in the first place. Intel is tech. Its the backbone of our innovation when it comes to high quality chip solutions. Its just my belief that they will skyrocket, judging quality, innovation and science. When you speak of culture like that you make it seem like its not the scientists down in bunkers developing all these thibgs doesn't exist. It sounds like you are describing the office on the west coast. Its a state backed company that is essential to the infrastructure of not just america but also the entire planet. I really dont know what your talking about. Its a really serious company.

Your talking about people who were too smart to go to mit and got sent down in bunkers for science, we are talking about people putting people in space kinda engineers,  extremely innovative and talented engineers, like literally the end of the line when it comes to tech the best in the business.
I would really read those articles you read with a grain of salt. Its a government contract company. Do you understand? Like lockhead and martin or boeing. Im gonna be honest. Im not gonna read ""teamblind"" lol.

The most likelt scenario i see ahead is that intel is once again is going to prove themselves like they did after amd won year 2005ish or whenever it was they beat the intel processor, intel is gonna be like oh well and release something that is gonna leapfrog amd. You can alreasy kinda see it today, their cpus are hogh in power consumption but yet keep cool, like hmm?? How?!  That means that they are probably going to be able to develop extremely fast cpus that run as cool as something twice the speed.  Their graphics card are midtier obly because they want them to be. Like your getting the a770 for 200 bucks.. thats craaaazy if you think about it. If they keep om going with graphics integrated cpus and gpus there might not even be a msrket for nvidia or amd left. Now. Amd and nvidia are both american companies and a capatilistic society doesnt want one company to have monopoly because prices and innovation gets messed up for the consumer but they could essentially take over that entire marketcap if they were allowed,  they got the money to do it, they got the science to do it. Will they? Probably not because of the government probably doesnt want that. They want competition to drive innovation. But to say that intel cant skyrocket like amd or nvidia would be weird to me as a fan of all three and as a fan of chip innovation.

But I'm talking the trend, that stock prices will be lower than now in 9 or 12 or 18 months. But there will also be many rallies. It takes a while to retrain investors that the conditions that kept stocks rising and zombie companies alive have changed. There will be bankruptcies of companies that can't survive on in an environment of ""normal"" interest rates. The market is overvalued, and macro conditions are deteriorating, so even as stock prices fall, shares can become even more overvalued as earnings fall.  
However, while I think it's worthwhile to compare valuations with similar drops in history to try to estimate a bottom, no one knows for sure. We're talking mass psychology, extraneous global events, politics, technological developments we can't see yet...  
So we can look at the whole picture, see how stocks have been valued in the last century or so, and assess that maybe an inflating US dollar is the best asset for a while. But there are guaranteed to be surprises.  
What I am confident of is that buying and holding the assets that made outsized gains from 2014 to 2021 and not going to make similar gains over the period where rates are rising or are held at 4%, 5% or higher. And gains may be weak for several years after that.  
And since we are here to talk about stocks, we're entering the kind of market where a thorough examination of a company's annual and quarterly reports and every stat that experts used to rely on is going to be essential. There will be stocks worth buying every month now, but it will take the kind of research and hard-nosed accounting comparisons that hardly anyone does any more. Stock picking will be important, and some of the best companies won't be ones that are widely known and held. They will include dividend payers, because you won't be able to rely on your picks catching on with other investors. The environment has changed. Beta will be lower. And, frankly, the issues that you want to own will not be ones that a lot of fellow punters on r/stocks will know about.  
Use a stock screener to find some prospects and then start ordering/downloading annual reports. Do research now for the things you might buy in December. It gets too easy in a broad and artificially sustained bull. It's going to get harder, so if you're going to be in individual stocks, you're going to have to go Old School.",t3_xf1dhn,1663386452.0,1

Intel's loss of fab dominance really began in 2018 IIRC, with the delays and how broken the original 10nm process was. By the time they fixed it, TSMC had moved on to 5nm. 

However for a while before that, Intel was the foundry leader. Multiple delays had brought it down from the lead, but even now Intel is essentially 1 node behind. 

Samsung is a shit show right now. Ignoring all the alleged corruption allegations, their processes have been getting delayed over and over again with bad yield, and even their performance/efficiency/density projections for both their future and past nodes are always shifting and contradicting themselves. 

>My second question is how are they gonna get more customers when most are already locked into one fab already. Unless they find some miraculous cost saving technology they are going to be selling things extremely close to cost.

Many customers aren't locked into one fab though. Numerous companies including Apple and Nvidia have all dual sourced at one point or another. 

Technology like BSPD and GAAFET, which TSMC won't have till 2025 with N2, are those 'miraculous' technologies Intel is planning to use to entice customers over.

Once the crypto crisis end (which btw was caused by the FED hiking rates so it won't last much longer), there is gonna be a huge increase in GPU demand. This is all temporary, nothing wrong at all with Nvidia business which is extremely strong and they are at the forefront of the AI revolution.

NVDA sold off over 50% in 2018 during QT and the ""crypto hangover"".

Back then it bottomed out with a PE in the low 20s, today it's trading with a 50 PE.

I get why people like the stock and I've owned it a number of times over the last few years, but I can't bring myself to buy it at the moment.

So, my confusion is that you seem to agree that AWS is a massive part of Amazon's valuation, and yet you deny that gaming/crypto are similar proportions of NVDA's valuation. NVDA puts gaming alone at ~10% of their revenues (e.g. gaming is ~$3.42B of their $27B).

I’ve been following stocks for three years now. I started when I was 18, in 2020, I am 21 now. During those first couple of years, market went wild. I missed seemingly every opportunity.

But one thing I realized. The opportunities kept coming, and will keep coming. First next gen tech, then EV, then crypto, then rotation out of tech, now back to tech, and AI. 

There is no shortage of opportunities in this world. If you keep your eyes open for the next opportunity, instead of reflecting on the past and what you missed, you will find it. This is a mistake people often make. They chase after trains that have already departed not seeing the new one arrive at the station. 


Artificial Intelligence is just getting started. I always was bummed I wasn’t alive or old enough during the early days of the internet, because that seemed like a generational wealth creation opportunity I missed. 

And then came ChatGPT. I now know a second wealth creation opportunity has arrived. 

I believe the best companies in the AI space have yet to even form! People forget Amazon IPO’d late into the tech bubble, 1997 I believe. Maybe the next great AI company is still under construction. But keep your eyes out instead of reflecting on the past. 


One final word about Nvidia- nothing intrisntic about the business changed, the arrival of ChatGPT changed the company’s outlook. It was getting (unfairly) beat down in 2022 , no one saw ChatGPT coming unless you worked in the space.

I've heard people call tech a bubble in the entirety of the past decade and more. (You have encountered them).

The people who always try to convince you that the fall of tech is just around the corner, that perhaps another - unknown stock - will lead the next decade. (You have encountered them).

These people are the same people who hate on people who buy Nvidia 4090 GPUs. They know what's the best of class product or stock, but don't want other people to enjoy the gains if they don't have it (crabs in a bucket).

Beware these people, as they can sound convincing and once you accept their (tech bubble) ideas, you may also become one of these people after you miss out on gains.

It's better to **keep it simple.** Tech revenue is growing at high double digits, that means their outperformance is still intact as no other sector is growing so. Debating over whether the stock should be 25 or 35 PE is meaningless, because double digit growth changes PE ratios quickly.

For example, MSFT's EPS is 2.5x higher than it was just 4 years ago. It might be hard to appreciate 20% in one year, but it adds up. That means 35 PE becomes 14 PE in just 4 years.

If you buy tech at a local peak and it goes down, like it did in 2020 and 2022, you're supposed to average down. MSFT Azure was growing at 46% this time last year despite the falling share price. They are opportunities and not ""aha tech bubble"" moments.",t3_13xwknm,1685675410.0,4

No, the US really didn't. *One* US president - Clinton - did, to avoid missing out on the China boom. Much like how the US tolerates Indian support for Russia today because it doesn't want to miss out on the Indian boom. 

But after that? Bush era US largely ignored China, because it was more focused on the Middle East, having started to wars there. Bush didn't do much for or against China.

Obama era US started paying more attention to China, but was still distracted by the Middle East, not to mention Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. Obama started an effort to soft contain China - the TPP.

Trump threw away the TPP, but I'd argue he was still the pivot to contain China, having started the trade war. 

Biden is now just following suit.

So if you want to argue about it, in the last 30 years, the US has had 8 years of helping China rise, and the other 22 were all either neutral or moving towards containment.

Also, the fed is not a friend of stocks and is raising rates to slow things down. High interest rates become appealing for savers because ""THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE"" is in play.

See, 2000 and 2022 are different. In 2000, the federal govt had the assets to step in and stop the drop. Same with 2008. Excpet 2008 was so bad that it rook all the gov'ts energy to stop ot from becoming a depression. Liquidity basically didn't exist after that. That's why we wnet from normal monetary policy to ZIRP and QE.

The deflative power of 2008 was so bad those two policies didn't even cause a >2%, inflation rate for a decade. Then when it did, the feds started trying to raise rates and the executive administration at the time pressured the treasury to pivot so the market was green for the 2020 elections. After 2020 we went full on helicopter money...

Long story short, there was a debt accrued for saving the economy in 2008. The govt never relieved that debt when it could have, and then accrued more debt in 2020. That debt will suck up liquidity again and cause deflation tk run rampant, and if it happens during a recession as we're entering right now, it can turn it into the very depression the govt tried to stop in 2008. Any economist will tell you deflation is far more dangerous than inflation.

That's what everyone is afraid of. We have a ticking time bomb in the federal debt pile and just as it's reaching maturity we're entering a recession. This could nuke the american economy for decades. That's what's different.",t3_y4xm5k,1665938466.0,2

Ideally, one would look at least a decade farther back, but QQQ didn't exist a decade back.  It's not impossible to synthesize something, but it's not 2 minutes of excel to do so like looking at QQQ returns.

Regarding accelerating returns, absolute returns will always accelerate with any positive exponential -- 500% to 600% is only a 20% gain in prices, so it could easily happen in a single year.  But 0% gain to 100% is a doubling in prices, which would reasonably take more like a decade.  That's why one should be using log charts for any significant timespan.

If you aren’t still bullish, then start taking at least 10-30% /year for piece of mind.

In my other reply I explain trimming should actually be done by selling covered calls when you’re still long term bullish, but feel it is over bought in the short term because of headlines hype. Selling at the money covered calls reduces your exposure by nearly 50% when the stock is peaking, getting paid for lowering your downside volatility.

There are still plenty of US households who have nothing better to do with their money than spend it on stocks. They can keep buying the dip because to them it doesn't matter whether the market goes down or starts to rally. It's opportunity cost that people are consciously making; buy more equities because there's nothing else that they need their money for.

Additionally, depending on the size of your account and your account type, it may not be feasible at all to sell everything and wait for a better opportunity. Someone who has 6-8 figures in a taxable brokerage account isn't going to be able to sell everything without incurring a massive tax penalty for doing so. Many people who have these accounts simply borrow capital from their stocks and never sell; in a year like this, the best option for them would be to borrow less than they normally do or pay down some of their short cash position (High Net Worth individuals typically call this strategy buy, borrow, die, with the idea that you don't pay capital gains during your lifetime).

Outside of Reddit, when I talk to people that I know (medicine, tech, finance, and construction industries primarily), wages are decent right now, bonuses are still on the table for most people (depending on how the rest of the year unfolds), and lay-offs haven't been any different than any other year (many Fortune 500 companies have annual layoffs in the fall as part of their typical business cycles). For these folks, it's business as usual. Lots of companies are still hiring strategically. On Reddit, there appears to be a different story brewing (e.g. wages are bad, layoffs are en masse, panic is setting in, etc.); this likely points to people being in different industries who are experiencing a different economy.

I don't think that buying the dip will fall out of favor. I think that the people who are buying are doing so consciously.

Good luck to all!",t3_xnot88,1664119817.0,32

6369,ipuq0d2,t3_xnot88,Going to keep buying personally my own opinion is we could fall more maybe down to 330-340 but i don’t think we will see the 40-50% more down people have been saying. I find it more likely we go through a period of time where the markets are relatively flat and pes that have been expanding since 2008 slowly catch back up to averages. I think dividend stocks with growth will continue to do well once the market bottoms and we go range bound for a bit. Something like a MSFT with a little dividend/ share buybacks/ decent growth I think will do decent especially if we see another 10% ish pull down. DCA into company’s that you use daily and understand and keep a minimum 25-50% in index’s and keep some cash on the sides and you will do great in the coming years.,t3_xnot88,1664121703.0,11
6370,ipugtzg,t3_xnot88,"My unasked for bear thesis: not enough people are paying attention to the DXY, and it feels like by far the most important index right now. If ANY other index was surging the way we see DXY is surging, people would be tripping over themselves to be in it. I suspect that because ""dollar strength"", though, is such a nebulous concept for most of us nobody really cares.

For you, me, and any other average investor, the 10% increase in DXY we have seen over the last 3 months doesnt really amount to much. We just dont have enough cash for it to really matter. Particularly in the face of high inflation. For these investment groups, companies, and banks with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, though? That 10% increase in dollar strength is meaningful. It makes zero sense for them to move off of cash positions until they start seeing prolonged evidence of the dollar strength stopping its run. This last week just closed with the dollar increasing by its largest single numerical candle increase, and among its largest percentage increases, that it has seen during the bull run its been on since last summer. Its not slowing, its still maintaining. 

DCA is still, by far, the most effective method for us low money investors, and that's going to hold true no matter what. However, until we see the dollar strength show prolonged evidence of slowing it just makes no sense for the big money that determines the direction of the market to start pouring enough in to spark a new bull run.

“buying the dip” is way different in a bull market vs a bear market. In a bull market you can expect your dip purchases to go green relatively quickly. In a bear market you should be more concerned with DCA over a long period of time, rather than thinking you ever timed the exact bottom. expect to lose on every purchase you make in the short term, maintain cash balance to be able to slowly add to your position with the intention of pushing your average down as the market slides.

All stock strategies will have flaws as no one truly can see the future, but if the premise is simply buying something cheaper today than it was yesterday, then only time can determine the successfulness of the strategy. Since mean regression suggests a CAPE of 15 is roughly the 60 year average, that still suggests the market can drop below ""fair value"" due simply to the time in overpriced territory still leading to a short term unsuccessful strategy.

Edit: Moreover, the mean CAPE over the past 40 years suggests a flaw in the value of 15 or the market has been inflated for nearly 40 years. This isn't to suggest shiller is wrong, but the market has a lot more participants with a lot more debt, huge passive index investing environment and more complicated financial products (think derivative, sub prime loans, shadow banking, etc) than we did 40-50 years ago.

6658,ipy5iv0,t1_ipw2mya,"Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is the most common way. With the ""art"" part of it being how you arrive at a discount rate using Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and some Risk Free Rate (RfR) of your liking. 

You can set up an Excel sheet following a good tutorial on DCF and WACC. Once you have that setup it takes less than 5 mins to input the data required which is all callable directly inside Excel or Sheets and also publicly available at any finance website like Yahoo Finance.  I personally just scrape the data I need from FinViz directly into my template based on whatever ticker I enter. 

Once I arrive at an intrinsic value (discounted 5 years or so out back to the present) I'll tack on a Margin of Safety of something like -25-40% based on macro market conditions. If the current stock price is below that price then it's a buy, with a ballpark expected return. 

This is the basic ""value investing"" method for finding undervalued companies. For growth stocks there's other things to consider like momentum, cycle, PE and sector disruption. 

Anyhow, in this entire thread I haven't seen one comment mention what their expected or target CAGR is over whatever their time horizon is.  You always hear that ""the market"" returns, on average, ~6-8% YoY. But that's looking at the average over 100 years.  If you've got 40 years before you expect to draw on your investments it's not gonna matter that much what you do.  If you've got 20 years, +/- 1% can make a pretty significant difference.  (Not all redditors are 25-35 yrs old).  Plus, you never know what can happen, beyond the safety of your emergency fund, if you have an emergency fund. 

If it sounds like I'm suggesting trying to ""beat the market"", I'm not.  Well, not technically. But I am interested in attempting to maximize my return on capital.  So any investment decision I make I'm going to be comparing it to ""the market"" , such as SPX.  If that's my benchmark, and I make an educated guess whether it will outperform or underperform in a given year or cycle, I'm willing to adjust my strategy vs blindly DCA into it.

I have a shorter time horizon than what seems to be the median on here and other circumstances that have me taking this approach.  But my point is, it's worth taking a look at what you expect/hope/must get out of your investments.  The bulk of it is really just saving.  Nothing better than regularly saving a fixed % of your income esp as it grows over time.  But I like to look at the numbers such that, ok, if I save X amount per month for Y years, that's Z amount saved.  Then, if those savings were going into SPX and I expect a 8% CAGR over those years, that equals this much more above having just saved.  Well what if the RFR is projected to be 4% for the next 2 years? Is there an investment that can return more than the 4% above that that SPX would give me? Maybe another index is looking better at 5.5% or something.  What's the risk? Etc

Granted, ends up being more active than most ppl want to be and doesn't guarantee better performance but I expect it to and hope it works out.  I look at some folks even older than me who only recently retired and the last year + inflation + prospects of a long sideways market is not being kind to their needs, when just a bit of portfolio optimization would have gone a long way YoY.

6659,ipy0ad4,t1_ipw2mya,"The intrinsic value could be described as how much you would be fairly paying for a particular business to not sell it and instead run it. Understanding it like this, you can avoid the age old mistake of telling yourself you are buying long term and selling in a panic after you see it drop a lot in a pinch.
But to be more precise, how I calculate it changes from business to business, as a bank has different ratios than a factory production company, a chip maker or a retailer. The main point is to buy what you can understand and quantify, so buy a business you believe you could run, at a price you would be sure to get your money worth in business value. 
If company A an average company in a sector you understand, say, an industrial with full integration and a fairly good chance that its costumers would not drop its products off if the prices kept growing over time with inflation, you have a chance to look at the companies earnings, and determine how much the business is worth by its Price/Earnings ratio. Let's say that the company has a growing revenue over a period of 20 years, but every 4 or 5 years it seems to drop a bit, and with it, it's price. This company would be a cyclical, with a 4 or 5 year cycle. This is quite common with car manufacturers, or other iron transformation industries. The way you would determine the price is like this: find the average earnings for the last long reasonable period, say at least 5 years, but preferably 10 or more and find the cagr if you still thing it is reasonable for the company to grow (when I say find, I actually want you to do some math as the numbers from websites vary wildly a d might not even have the same calculations you want to use) and now you have a large part to the intrinsic value formula I use for industrials. Say the company has debt, take note of how much net debt or net book value you se in its ballance sheet ad divide it by the number of shares. Now you can start the actual intrinsic value calculation: value = [[(avgPE 0 growth company) * 2CAGR]/ current interest rate] + net value of tangible assets per share - liabilities per share} 
Some explanations: for average PE of zero growth companies (over long periods of time) you should expect it to be 8.5 most of the time, so this can safely become used in most times you do this calculation.
CAGR is the permanent rate of growth you expect for the holding period, and you multiply it by 2 in order to have it increased to simulate a long period of holding this stock. After that you take the cost of oportunity in the form of how much you could earn currently for companies graded as the one you are looking at. Why buy a stock if the bond yields a satisfying return and the stock doesn't?
This is not the only way, but this can be used in a broad selection of stocks, and to read more you can read the intelligent investor or security analysis. 
Important note, what you can reasonably expect to earn is the difference between intrinsic value and what you pay below it. It might not work with just one stock, but in a portfolio of 20 it should more than suffice to be a good predictor of earnings. To this difference we call margin of safety.",t3_xnot88,1664177050.0,4

Averages tend to be influenced more by skewing (positively or negatively) in data values. In these cases the median provides a more useful, representative sense of where the central tendency of the data lie.  

Think of this example: let’s say we are interested in getting to to a sense of household income across the US. What is the central tendency of these all household incomes, expressed as one value? For the year 2020, the average, or mean, is about $97,000, while the median is around $67,500 (half of households have income above $67,500 and half have income below $67,500.)

AMD is actually competing decently in GPUs now, though its still gonna be 2 or 3 generations before they can compete for the absolute top end with AI, fully path traced games, basically just all the extra features Nvidia offers besides performance. Still good though, because most people don't take anything more than gaming or crytpto mining performance into account.

Their CPUs are amazing and they're slowly chipping away at Intel's absolute dominance in enterprise systems. 

Nvidia is also a blind buy. Some people probably think they're the only GPU manufacturer that exists. They are the absolute best of the best in GPUs, which isn't hard since  there's only 2 lol

Intel is making GPUs now too,but they're garbage and will stay garbage for I'm guessing 3 generations before they are seriously competing in the mid range. I have no clue when they'd be fighting with Nvidia for #1, but it's gonna happen at some point. 

Even though their CPUs aren't beating AMD by a landslide anymore, they still have a massive amount of market share and can easily make CPUs that don't use more energy than a thermal reactor.

INTC: Margins will continue to shrink. -Consumer: Apple moved to own chips, PC providers will likely have ARM-based chips from one or more vendors.

-Data Center: Cloud providers moving to their own chips (e.g. Graviton for AWS, likely MS and Google are designing their own server chips). RISCV is also coming up.

-AI chips: NVIDIA dominates, but cloud providers are also designing their own (TPU, Inferentia, Trainium, …).  Also 100+ AI startups

-Other business units are too small and highly competitive and low margin

-Behind TSMC in manufacturing, custom foundry remains to be seen. Intel tried it before and failed, foundry is fundamentally a different business style than Intel is used to. Intel’s manufacturing unit has always had a captive customer (x86), now needs to fight for customers.

Intel will survive, but as a shell of itself. Margins will be much lower, company will be much smaller, and revenues not grow fast.

AMD is solid, high growth, high margins in a good subsector of the semiconductor industry (B2B server and HPC). It's a buy under 85, valuation isn't insane.

NVDA is overpriced and their growth doesn't justify the price. Good buy once crypto has fully gone into a freeze.

Nvidia -  Grew because of Crypto.  Now they have to make the right investments and gambles again.  Unless Nvidia creates dedicated crypto chip/PCIE-card, and crypto has growth again, I don't expect them to have that explosive growth again.  That said their Full stack approach (software, UI, AI, verse, GPU), as well as server adoption puts it in a really good place for sustain and future.  This also allows them to do a software licensing to offset hardware costs.  I think they are making great investments.  The main issue is cost for stock price.  They aren't going anywhere. 

AMD - AMD is My short term pick.  If you are looking to sell next year, or at least reevaluate, AMD is my pick.  They are eating Marketshare.  They are making investments to get into Enterprise equipment.  They are creating top of line consumer CPUs and dominating low end. And their high end server grade are at least equal footing to Intel, if not better.  Their biggest hurdle is breaking into the trust between intel and companies have had for decades.  Their acquisition of Xilinx is a huge technology advancement. Again, I think they are making good investments, but they don't control fabs, and they don't control end product.  And they are pricey, but I can't fathom them not growing in 2 years. 

Intel.  My choice for intel, is it is low risk and high potential.  Which is ideal for stocks.  It is extremely cheap now, but will likely not improve much in the next year.  But they have fab, and plan to sell that fab space for other companies.  This is HUGE.  This is competition with TSMC. And they still have time to get their processes fixed.   They also don't just sell CPU/GPU. They have NICs, Memory, Ethernet, FPGAs.  Which are all small compared to their competitors.  They have the best case for a truly integrated SoC, which is good for servers.  Which they already have trust.   They are investing in GPU, Mobile, both are risky, but could pay off handsomely.

Nvidia might have come out with a CPU, but it looks like an arm, where most software runs x86.    Apple's RISC didn't pay off and take over the world.   Maybe this arm will, stuff is more agnostic now.

Nvidia and to a lesser extent AMD has been bolstered recently by crypto.    That's not going to last forever, eventually we'll run out of things to factor, or quantum computers will do it all in 5 minutes.

6892,iin7sg0,t3_wea08q,"So I’m answering from an IT auditor/gamer background: 

Nvidia is not going to see the record demand they saw for their 30-series cards. Those cards were being bought up in record numbers for crypto miners, gamers, business use, etc., leading to the shortage. With the crypto market crashing (or at the very least…receding), miners won’t buy cards in massive lots. And their 40-series cards are the third generation of their RTX technology. Meaning if someone wants that, they can still get a 20-series card that does an excellent job. So while Nvidia will do fine, the launch of the 4000 series will not be the windfall like the 3000 series was. They also don’t make CPU’s, so…I think they’re the riskiest bet of the three. 

Onto to Intel. They are in the shakiest position. They’ve enjoyed years of essentially being the top dog until AMD finally managed to give them some competition. And while they’re trading blows in the consumer space, I see only losses there. But the commercial space is where it really matters, because that’s where you get $10M orders. Now I believe Intel likely has hold over the CPUs in business laptops and I don’t see AMD changing that (for security reasons built into the chips that AMD doesn’t do). But on the server side? AMD has built products to challenge Intel, but…Intel has agreements with companies. So the question is going to become can AMD convince Intels customers they’re the better choice in the long run, and cause Intel to lose them? This is hard to know, and honestly…I don’t really see it, so I’d say Intel is likely the steadiest, safest returns you’ll see. 

AMD is gaming’a golden child. Taking on a Nvidia with GPU’s and Intel with CPU’s. Unfortunately, their GPU’s can’t compete with higher end Nvidia, and the Intel battle…they’re pretty much even. AMD I do believe dominates the consumer space. But their GPU’s also did well because of the crypto craze, so I don’t expect that to have the same financial performance. And they need to start really cracking into the server realm for companies to really grow, and we aren’t seeing that as much. There could be reasons behind that, license/service agreements, but if they can, that growth could be huge. Or they might flounder. I’d say AMD is the middle ground between the two companies. They are more diversified than Nvidia in terms of products, but Nvidia still has the better GPU. And Intel still holds the corporate contracts that make big money. 

In the 10 year run, I’d probably go 45% Intel, 35% AMD, 20% Nvidia.",t3_wea08q,1659449257.0,0

Fabs don't make near as much revenue as the main company, Intel is just so massive they could afford it but AMD could technically buy back their spin off company global foundries and bring it up to speed. What is the real issue here is what company has room to grow and has demonstrated this yearly. It's AMD, it competes in a growing sector of sales and more and more compute farms come online daily with big big companies like AWS and Google buying high margin server parts as fast as they can be made. In the past AMD had something as low as 5% market share and Intel has 90% while now AMD has 20 and Intel 70 roughly. This shows in a big way in the company's revenue. The last factor I will mention is Intel pays dividends but AMD only does buy backs and is slated for an increase from 1bil to 8bil buy backs for the coming year. This pretty much means the company is signaling which of the categories it falls into. The AMD execs quote 20% growth and I honestly believe them. I believe them so much that I passed an Intel RnD job that I would have loved for a lower paying position at AMD. I had a research project they sponsored at my uni but also had an AMD internship previously and weighed my options to end up here.

Also a last word, I don't think either company is going anywhere and I think Intel has so much promise in emerging technology and fabrication. Nvda I don't know enough about but I will say ...

I believe you will continue to see this trend.  The world has changed and the big tech companies just are a lot bigger than they were in the past.  There is much more concentration and that creates an exceptable ROI on doing your own chips.

7078,iiqk6aj,t1_iinzbtl,"Intel's chips use significantly more power than AMD chips as well as nvda using more for gpus. It's so stark I think AMD has 2x the performance per watt and are set up with pushing the gap even farther as Intel releases details pointing to huuuge power draws. Also AMD has Intel beat in server parts by miles, in games with their x3d, in compute with their high core count parts and I think there is talks of 32 and 64 core desktop parts while Intel struggles to maintain their core count as they try to push single thread performance, the only area they win in if you have the thermal management for and the power supply for. If you are buying Intel which I can support, then I wouldn't downplay the serious issues the company has to tackle.

A big big factor in Intel's dominance is server part buyers do not swap providers so easily. They take consistency over anything and swapping server parts isn't so simple as building a computer at home. It requires billions in engineering and every software suite has to be re optimized for AMD. It also means that a relationship and communication has to be formed more closely with AMD.

Just last month I had an argument with someone here on Reddit who felt Intel was dirt cheap and I said it will go back to $35 soon 

Anyways for all kids who have short term memory loss. Here is Intel's typical framework during the ER from 2019 onwards

1) Guide next quarter low
2) Say that DC is not growing across the world
3) Give some excuse on 'Supply Chain Issues' (last few qtrs) or 'Inflation' now
4) Barely meet the already 'lowered' guidance or miss it
5) Go to Step 1

If anyone bothered to listen to the ER 'Pat said that Q3 will be the bottom' so wont be surprised to see Intel missing next qtr guidanace also. 

Intel has also been hit with super high coats. Lets be real right now is not be best time to put billions in construction, Pat said their Fab cobstruction budgets are going higher due to inflation. It is too much spending with no return right now. 

Funds will be careful right now. With inflationary env why will a fund invest in such a risky bet.

Pretty much all the actual growth in nominal terms has come from GPU sales, and the vast majority of that, to crypto. Ya sure they do other things. Their entire robotics / ai division is a thing. A thing that accounts for c 2% of revenue. Professional visualisation is a thing. C 8% of revenue.

But graphics is still 60%+ of revenue, and that doesn’t even (allegedly) include crypto, which is under Computers and Networking. But here’s the thing - in the last two years, majority of graphics card sales haven’t been for rendering or to gamers - they’ve been to miners. Flows that are rapidly dropping to zero (following crypto prices). Flows that will get hit even harder by the cessation of ethereum mining. Even the gaming flows will get smashed as all those extra 3090s hit the market now that the miners don’t need them, and even if that wasn’t a factor - we’re about to hit a major recession. Do you know what people need least during a recession? A shiney new graphics card.

NVIDIA trades at 50x earnings, or a 2% earnings yield (fun story, inflation >> 2%). Why would anyone ever pay this much for a company? Because they expect it to be on a Pe of 10 in five years time. How much do earnings have to grow per year to be 5x higher in 5 years? About 38%.

Take it one fuck of a long way below 38%.

Do you know what happens to super high valued growth stocks when earnings reports stop supporting their growth assumptions?

7480,jas3mht,t1_japudc7,"So let me step back a second to help answer those questions.

With either mining or staking, the actual transaction processing requires very limited computational power. All you need to run is some very basic software that 'listens' to the network for new transactions. That software also runs very basic checks to make sure that these transactions are valid. And it batches up these new transactions into potential blocks to be added to the blockchain. 

The difference between mining and staking is that they have different processes for determining how new blocks of verified transactions get added to the blockchain (where they are ultimately finalized and recorded).

With mining, miners are competing against one another over who gets to add the block of transactions they've processed to the blockchain. They are all racing to solve these computational 'puzzles', and the first person to solve the puzzle wins. This is where the computational effort comes in, using lots and lots of GPUs or even ASICs. The winner--the person who gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain--receives a 'prize' in the form of new coins being minted. So this is how new issuance happens.

In staking, there's no competition to solve computational puzzles, hence the ~99.9% reduction in energy usage. Instead, it's basically a lottery system, where every 10 seconds (for Ethereum) the protocol randomly chooses a staker who wins the right to post a new block of transactions to the blockchain (and receives the 'prize' of newly minted coins). The more coins you're posting as collateral for staking, the higher probability you have of winning this lottery. Think of it like buying more raffle tickets.

To answer your second question, there is still a cryptographic hash when staking. The hash is created when the lottery winner adds their block of transactions to the blockchain.

The difference between mining and staking boils down to differences in the protocol rules for determining who gets to add their block of new transactions to the blockchain. But they both rely on crytographic hashes to create an immutable ledger, the blockchain, that is shared by all participants on the network.

Yes, although it's worth noting that this is true of mining, too. Mining is generally an extremely capital intensive industry with huge economies of scale, especially Bitcoin. In the case of Bitcoin, an average Joe like you or me simply cannot mine profitably at home. You need a warehouse full of mining equipment with access to cheap power. 

And while some cryptos can be mined at home by a hobbyist with a couple GPUs, those hobbyists are not nearly as profitable as industrial miners mining at large scale.

7484,jat9dll,t1_jasww6q,"Let's use Ethereum as an example.

The frequency of the lottery, and the amount of new coins issued for each lottery, are part of the rules of the Ethereum protocol as defined by the source code of the software used to run the protocol. That code is open source and completely transparent; it can be reviewed by anyone.

The key is that in order to participate in the Ethereum network, the software you are running MUST follow those rules, which are known as consensus rules.

Now, in theory, anyone can code and run a different version of the Ethereum software that changes those rules. You can change whatever rules you want, including things like the amount of new coins issued for each lottery. *However*, by changing these consensus rules, you will no longer be able to participate in the main Ethereum network. You will instead be running a separate instance of the network.

This is what is known as a hard fork. This is how many cryptos have been created (for example, Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin). Your modified version of the software is not compatible with the main network, so you have now created a new network. 

So you would then need to convince other users that your modified network, with its modified rule set, is somehow better than the original Ethereum network. Users would have to voluntarily choose to switch over to your instance of the network.

In practice, this never really happens, because cryptocurrencies are all about the network effect. More users means a more useful protocol/currency, and a more valuable token. There's very little incentive for users to switch over to a new, unpopular version of the protocol that is incompatible with all the various apps and whatnot that have been built on top of the original network.

Hope that helps.

Edit: just to clarify, the new coins that you'd be creating on your modified network would NOT be ETH. They would be different. No exchange or other website would consider them ETH. So you'd be creating a useless currency (again, unless you convinced a bunch of people to use your network who agreed that this new token had real world value... and then you'd have to convince the crypto exchanges to list your new token so that people could buy and sell it).",t3_11emag7,1677881663.0,1

Okay -- so now once again we are on a voluntary system controlled by human will -- like fiat currency.

Well for one, I hope I conveyed in my last comment that you can't go willy nilly changing the code against the will of the users. Especially for well-established projects like BTC and ETH, even the developers/maintainers of the source code can’t unilaterally change the rules of the network unless the userbase agrees to those changes and decides to run the updated software.

Sure, on some level there is fundamentally a human element. Software is developed and run by humans. People are free to fork an existing network, or create an entirely new network. And if other people see value in that new implementation, then they are free to go use it. But it’s not an either/or decision. If people don’t agree to the changes, then no one can stop them from using the original implementation. 

You should also realize that there’s strong incentive NOT to change the rules. For one, it provides stability. For example, the Bitcoin protocol has always had a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin. This results in a known, predictable ‘monetary policy’. In that sense, Bitcoin is actually more predictably scarce than gold, since we know with certainty that there will only ever be 21 million BTC, while gold’s supply will increase indefinitely at an unknown pace as new deposits are found. 

Could someone implement a hard fork that changes that 21 million hard cap, e.g. increasing it by a factor of 10 and paying out the new coins to themselves? Sure, but like… why would anyone else agree to run that version? Nobody would, and Bitcoin would chug along undeterred. In fact, the Bitcoin community (moreso than other cryptos) are quite dogmatic about the 21 million cap. If that hardness feature of a currency is something that is important to you, then you would align well ideologically with the BTC community. 


> What's to prevent this system from being hacked, if it incorporates control logic?

So let's compare typical physical/cyber security with the way it works in crypto:

- Traditional security paradigm: imagine a sort of bullseye. At the very center is the thing (e.g. sensitive information, a vault full of gold, whatever) that you're guarding. Only your most trusted circle has access to this innermost layer. From there, you keep intruders out by creating layers of security, clearance, secrecy, and obfuscation. This type of security relies on how well you can keep secrets secret, how well you can obfuscate. But of course, we know that these types of setups are not immune to failure; and in particular, they are especially prone to inside jobs.

- Crypto paradigm: any reputable crypto has open-source code that can be reviewed and scrutinized by anyone at all times, including hackers. It's like the world's greatest honeypot. If you could hack BTC, you'd be able to mint yourself a fortune. And yet we’re going on ~14 years now and nobody has successfully hacked it.

It's a totally different approach to security. Ultimately, it comes down to how competent the developers are. There have definitely been other crypto protocols that have been hacked. And yes, many crypto *businesses* (exchanges, wallets, etc.) have been hacked, usually because they are companies using traditional security methods (and crypto is rife with inside jobs too!).

But the Bitcoin code has thus far withstood the test of time. It’s battle-hardened. So while I do have lingering points of worry for crypto, hacks at the protocol level--at least for reputable cryptos like BTC and ETH—are generally not one of them.

There’s one other interesting point here, which is that a major bug or hack doesn’t necessarily need to be fatal for a crypto protocol. In the event they occur, the community can agree to execute a hard fork to effectively roll back or unwind the effects of the bug/hack as if they hadn’t happened. 

This is not always without controversy, mind you, and it does point to the human element of all this. For example, there was a notable hack that occurred to an application on top of Ethereum a few years back. It would have resulted in people losing hundreds of millions of dollars. In the end, the majority of the community agreed to a hard fork that rolled back the hack (this ‘side’ of the fork is what is today called Ethereum), while a smaller subset disagreed and continued to use the original implementation with the hack (this ‘side’ is today called Ethereum Classic).

""mini-bear"" or mini-bull markets are pretty meaningless. As investors, the only thing we should care about are long-term, secular bear markets.

The period 1973 - 1977 was a long-term secular bear

The period 2000 - 2009 was another, and one of the worst investing periods in US history aside from the 1930s. Not only were stocks complete trash, but dividend yields were at historic lows. There are dozens of stocks that peaked in early 2000 that are still down 40% or more 23 years later (Cisco for instance)

Not trying to move the goal posts, P/E being up definitely changes my view but not sure if its a fair comparison if the interest rates have gone up. Definitely a bullish sign that E/P (PE inverse) is going up over the next 2 years, looks like a bull market than?

Unless there’s a deep recession, it might be longer than what the Fed is saying for 2% on core PCE.

So you see how someone that is 80 years old and not working is counted against the US participation rate and not the EU participation rate? These are not comparable numbers.

2. Builders limiting construction to a handful of mcmansions at a time, squeezing supply at the low and mid end, forcing the hunger games in real estate. Occupants of mid level homes cannot afford to trade up when the next level up is so ridiculously overpriced. 
3. Nvidia holding back on 4000 silicon to sell their 3000 silicon at full retail value, even though that architecture is deprecated.

It’s also funny you use this comparison though. Because people have no issues with used cars if they work and serve their purpose, but they get upset at buying an older GPU that could also serve their purpose. 

6xxx series is your mid range-low end, and even still viable high end. 7xxx just dropped you aren’t getting the lower tiers for a while longer.

> Lol of course we go with a worst case example. However, I don’t like it but I completely accept that, that is how hospitals operate so I counteract that by finding a job that provides adequate medical coverage.

This is illustrated here. Your reasoning isn’t that over charging for health care is morally ok it’s that specifically hospitals operate in that way so you counter treat by finding a job with medical coverage. 

Notice how that doesn’t actually answer the question of wether or not the charge is shitty. One can operate normally in a way that’s shitty, just because they normally do that doesn’t make what they normally do not shitty.

> And before you give me the guilt trip about not all people have that luxury, they actually do. Medical assistance benefits are awesome in the US if you truly can’t afford good coverage. I know lots of people personally that have MA and there are practically no exclusions.

All of this is also completely meaningless to wether or not what they are doing is shitty. The fact that some jobs offer medical perks to counter the shitty health care doesn’t have anything to do with the original act of shittyness.

The second issues is that you are just stating that it’s unchangeable. The current system we have is not the system we started with.

Nvidia's Fiscal 2021:


* Total revenue: $16.68 billion

* Data center: $6.70 billion (40.16% of total rev.)

* Gaming:  $7.76 billion (46.52% of total rev.)

* Non-GAAP Gross margin: 65.6%



Nvidia's Fiscal 2022:


* Total revenue: $26.91 billion

* Data center: $10.61 billion (39.42% of total rev.)

* Gaming:  $12.46 billion (46.30% of total rev.)

* Non-GAAP Gross margin: 66.8%



Nvidia's Fiscal 2023:


* Total revenue: $26.97 billion

* Data center: $15.01 billion (55.65% of total rev.)

* Gaming:  $9.07 billion (33.62% of total rev.)

* Non-GAAP Gross margin: 59.2%



Yes, on the surface if you compare to last year's result, it looks horrible, including gross margin.  But most sensible investors are forward looking and they can see that the data center business is still accelerating, and they see that Q4 FY23 Non-GAAP Gross margin is back to 66.1%.  We already knew that last year result was mostly driven by work-from-home and crypto-mania phases, where everyone and their grandmother were buying gpus to play games at home or mining ethereum when ethereum got as high as $4,900.  The crypto-mania is now over, and ethereum has transitioned to be proof of stake, so people can no longer use their gpus to mine ethereum for profit.  Also nowadays, everyone and their grandmother is out and about traveling, so gpus/pc sales are down considerably, and Nvidia had to get rid of their high inventory which affected their gross margin.  However, with the latest result, we can see that even the gaming part of the business is on its path to recovery.

Despite all of the above, is NVDA overvalue compares with other companies?  Possibly, but...imagine a world, where everyone and their grandmother is developing an AI or ML(machine learning) application/program.  They will have to get into Nvidia's cuda(software) and acceleration(hardware) platforms, which Nvidia pretty much has a monopoly over, and this is the moat that investors care most about.  So going forward from here, you can imagine what percentage of Nvidia's data center business will be, and the potential of that huge gross margin can do for this kind of growth.  And I still haven't even talked about their automotive and software growth potential.  With all that said, do your own diligence, and don't invest with money that you can't afford to lose, because everything in life is constantly changing, and there are no guarantees(unless it's death and taxes?  Maybe).

Q4: $3.62B

The previous years was what, 50%+ growth YoY? That was huge growth. That justifies a hefty multiple. Now it’s flatlined and contracted. Next quarter will probably be negative YoY data center growth

Isn’t data center where their hopper stuff and other AI-related big boy implementations go? Why is that contracting so much?

Their data center print today was a *huge* miss. The gaming beat from no where was the reason they got just over the expectations.

Isn’t data center the lifeblood of NVDA and AI? Why is it contracting over the last year, and now we’re entering a recession-ish while the cloud providers have made it abundantly clear that they’re cutting spending and looking to utilize current hardware better. NVDA mooned last year when META said they were spending an extra 10% in capex and mooned again after META said they were going to cut that 10% on the last ER.

And those cuts are just getting started. AMD reported flat data center but said they expect data center to contract by double digits next quarter. Was NVDA just hit first by business spending cuts? I don’t understand how their number was that bad

What about China sales? They’ve rerouted and have been able to send US-approved chips but they are not the top line chips. Why are there no worries about getting locked out of the Chinese market with the AI hype and having a substantial impact to earnings?

What about competition entering the fray? Google has TPU, Tesla has Dojo, Amazon has Inferentia. They’re in infancy I get it. I’m sure I’m missing some and I’m sure more will be unveiled. I also get NVDA has a head start and is the current elephant, but the market is collectively saying that NVDA is the only future based on the current state of chip sales

I just don’t understand why the hype isn’t showing up in the numbers or guidance. And now it’s more expensive than it’s pretty much ever been, in a 5% interest rate environment. I just can’t touch this stock. It’s just a perpetual hype cycle. TSM and ASML are just as important in the AI hardware supply and don’t get nearly this ridiculous multiple.

Also as for reference the GPU market barely exists for 20 years. I owned the original GeForce256 lol, that was the first product marked as GPU. Haven't checked the date but that would have been about 22 years ago or so. And this GPU was amazingly expensive for the time, I one of the first 100 to have one in my country and I remember the PC builder gaping at the price, saying WTF do you need that for. 

&#x200B;

There is also a few other issues, and that is that at the moment the 4000 series GPU's is it's time ahead. There is very little incentive to buy anything new if you have a 3000 series, which have flooded the market since the crypto bust. Also easily explainable, if you play any of the blockbuster titles like Call of Duty, they have not really progressed in graphics technology, at least not at the speed the GPU's have evolved. However there is a number of engines upcoming like Unreal Engine 5 that might change this over the next few years.

&#x200B;

In the professional market though, where time is money. nVidia is simply the undisputed king of GPU's. Even the ATI 7000 series is not finding a great amount of support due to driver issues etc. If time is money you want a product that works out of the box and don't spend hours tweaking a card. If I pay a designer $100K+ per year, give him a 5-10K workstation, then even a 1% loss of time due to crashes or other losses of productivity will easily justify the more expensive nVidia product.

If it is in terms of unit unit volumes it might be (I haven't checked the exact numbers and where it currently slots in) but it's also not as notable a figure as the long 20 year time line might seem, as the entire PC market landscape was very different 20 years ago. 

The PC desktop market and discrete GPU shipments by unit volume actually peaked somewhere in the late 2000's. Since then IGPs have become more prevalent and good enough. Desktops in general have been shifting to laptops, and PCs in general to tablets/smartphones which correlated to a decline in discrete GPU unit shipments. Even PC shipments in general were on year on year decline until Covid.  

It isn't the case however if you look at certain segments and overall revenue shipments. The bottom end market where most of the unit volume was might be gone but it's been replaced by much higher ASP units up market for both consumers and professional usage.

So there is an interesting dynamic in play here. On one hand per unit demand is down, on the other hand revenue and profits are being buoyed by those willing to spend willing to spend even more. Unit demand is also likely up in certain segments.",t3_119f9u0,1677154349.0,3

It doesn't matter if Google or Microsoft or whoever wins in the AI chat wars, because Nvidia wins with their cuda(software) and tensor-cores(hardware) monopoly.  You can research on more about cuda and tensor-cores on your own if you want to have a better understanding of Nvidia's moat/monopoly.

Also, where did I say that I was a sensible investor?  I only given you the perspective of someone who is buying/holding NVDA shares, and gave you reasons for doing so.  And lastly, as a software engineer, coders don't just switch to another programming language to code because ""industry that changes every single day.""

I think this is the current iteration of what people thought about solar and ESG in 2020. And then EV’s in 2021. I remember MSFT making huge announcements and talking about how green they were on conference calls. Walmart talked about how many solar panel projects they were doing to go green. Now they’re talking about how much they’re putting in AI and no one cares about ESG anymore. AAPL announced an EV and then haven’t done anything since the hype train shut

I think like solar, it’s way further out for mass adoption (and more importantly monetization) than people think. Mostly for legal and liability reasons honestly, but also from technology standpoint. It’s new-ish to start getting publicly adopted and I foresee a lot of issues with liability and legal frameworks 

ChatGPT to me is just an advanced search / Wikipedia function. I almost view it as a plagiarism bot. I’m much more interested to see what the generative AI can do, and also how AI gets implemented in things like cyber security. But for now I just can’t help but see ChatGPT replacing call centers and English majors and being a convenient search tool

8250,j9uh58s,t1_j9mveu6,"Could mean that NVDA was oversold to begin with based on macroeconomic fears - which seems to be a narrative supported by the fact that pretty much every other tech company on the nasdaq had similar declines. 

META was pushing almost below a 10 PE ratio which was the cheapest against earnings the company had been in like 6-7 years. 

NFLX lost a negligible amount of subscribers, and while it was their first loss ever, they raised subscription prices by like 10% and lost like 0.2% of their subscriber base - a net win for revenue, yet NFLX was pushed down to like 15 PE ratio.

All of this to say that the macroeconomic fears were so bad that many companies were cheap from a fundamentals perspective, so cheap that if you looked only at that, you'd've been down even buying META at a 15 PE or NFLX at a 20 PE, which historically would've been a great move. And later on, it would prove to be exactly that.

I also want to point out that tesla had a PE ratio pushing 300 at one point, and people said the same thing, but there's two parts of PE ratio that can change - price, and earnings. And tesla's earnings exploded into the stratosphere so fast that everyone calling for the stock to crash when it had 100 PE ratio are now down if they shorted because the PE has settled to near 50 levels. 

If AI demand continues to explode in the coming years, like some are speculating, it isn't surprising to see that NVDA, which is one of the best companies to gain from AI's explosion, is the new speculative bet on the block.

That being said, AI interest could also fade which would be very bad news for NVDA's share price. It's up to you to determine if you think that their growth will outpace the PE ratio fast enough to bring the share price down to a fair valuation",t3_119f9u0,1677259456.0,1

I'm a software developer and it is already very useful for coding and there are more powerful models coming out soon that will make it even more powerful. There is simply no way that this field won't be completely revolutionized, which could very well suck for people like me. But in any case it will mean a higher level abstraction and will most certainly result in much cheaper software development and hopefully a lot more software as an effect. Don't think about search (monetization will be challenging) but think about B2B and subscription tools as the killer application. Yes, call centers as well, but that is just one of many fields that is obviously going to be disrupted with the tech that is already available. Movie/TV production, gamedev, really any media is next as well.

I was comparing to the mispricing of extreme startups, or biotechs etc, where everything hinges on extreme growth expectations - which are SO speculative that price can be so misaligned with fundamentals that it becomes laughable, like NIO or whatever.

I was annoyed at the implied clarity of OP, when in fact price movement in companies at this scale should be seen as coming before the analysis of why. Like, in this case its exactly that simple, revenue decline was priced in and the totality of future cash flows is valued at what it is, period - it’s not gonna be crazy off. 

Like essentially a super computer’s DCF analysis of NVIDIA
is at at all times relatively anchored in reality, and because of their scale and attention, the real time pricing of NVIDIA is essentially that of a super computer.

Lastly, I do disagree that 50% move in no news is material evidence of mispricing, either way (before or after). That’s because mispricing isn’t analyzed on an objective static scale, it’s relative to the market, and more specifically relative to other investment vehicles with the same risk profile.

&#x200B;

*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*  
  
*A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that’s been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald’s was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald’s could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn’t anything wrong with McDonald’s. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*  
  
*And if McDonald’s was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot’s company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*  
  
*If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you’d just be breaking even today.*  
  
*I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: “Due to the recent bankruptcy, we’re removing this stock from our buy list.” In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I’ve ever seen before or since.*  
  
*You often hear about companies whose future performance is “discounted” in the stock price. If that’s the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*  
  
*When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64—though nowhere near as extreme as EDS’s. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It’s a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon’s earnings didn’t grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18⅝ in 1974.*  
  
*The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*  
  
*The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14⅛ in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid’s p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*  
  
*Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn’t have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*",t3_12c6sbx,1680669188.0,109

But I do not want to post a whole essay on everything, so I left the original explanation short and sweet.

That being said, we are seriously one bad china news event from semis being blown up. If you have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, they can tell you how bad the situation has become over the past few years. US investors are seriously underestimating the probability of China’s interference in Taiwan. It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when. I’m not saying they’re going to have a full-on invasion, they are going to be much more surgical than that. There will be a bold move they make soon and it will be a minsky moment where US investors assign a non-zero chance that TSMC could be at risk in the future. The moment investors wake up, is the moment panic sets in.

&#x200B;

To cut a long story short I think it's 50/50 for this quarter but that the next quarters are going to bring much softer results. Here's some bullet points of why:  
  
  
Covid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.  
  
AI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.  
  
High Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.  
  
Insider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.

8310,jf249kq,t3_12c6sbx,"Just some clarification:

The reason I go for shorter-dated, far OTM puts is because timing is impossible for these kinds of shorts. Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.

Whereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining.",t3_12c6sbx,1680706721.0,1

So for Nvda, buy put spreads expiring at least in July, if not September. That way you’ll be protected from theta, and if the price runs, you can buy back the short and have more upside if your spirit has not been broken by that point. And If the stock does fall, you’ll be able to sell for a gain.

Another option is to short the stock while buying puts 5-10 strikes out of the money. You won’t net much but you’ll be able to sleep at night if the stock runs up a bit",t3_12c6sbx,1680697452.0,1

With puts, you gotta get BOTH the time and price correct, in a short time frame. If you can do that repeatedly without relying on luck, you'd be fking rich.

This market is a slow grind, similar to 2000 recession. It's not some steep drop like 2008 where very few people saw it coming. And if it's a steep drop, you bet Powell will swoop in and do QE again. Puts is not how you play this market.",t3_12c6sbx,1680670984.0,17

Don’t think about what could or could not be. We won’t know until we get there. If we did know, everyone would be on the same boat, right? In which case, there would be no money to be made. Lol.",t3_14jrovc,1687820914.0,2
8555,jpnjovh,t3_14jrovc,"I sold. 


I guess try to come up with a reasonable value you think the company is worth despite what the current stock market says. 

Also try to come up with what it will be worth in 5 years. 

If the current price is higher than those estimates its probably a good sign to sell. If its lower then you can hold. 

My I did this a few weeks ago my estimates were still much lower than the current price. So selling was pretty obvious  to me.",t3_14jrovc,1687821653.0,2

When would you want to spend the money? What would you do if NVDA fell by a third?

I have just under 20% of my portfolio in NVDA, including holdings within mutual funds. I’ve reduced my exposure from when I loaded up in December. But I’m not betting against NVDA even if they retreat for a year or two.

On the other hand, it wouldn't be a bad thing to take some of those gains.

And of course it kept going up.  I should have held onto it. but at least I made a very nice profit.  My biggest regret is not buying a lot more.  

I won't buy more now because I have no luck at buying into a stock when it seems super hot.  Something happens and it sinks.

Lol never got to happen.

Nvidia doesn't have 80% GPU market share because the hardware is so great, they are at 80% because Nvidia is super strong in the next state of the art technology only achievable with Nvidia cards and very strong support for developers also mostly only available with Nvidia cards. Developers then develope games and other products with Nvidia GPU of course therefore Nvidia cards also perform often far better even when an AMD card seems stronger from the values, games still vastly run better with Nvidia cards. Same goes on for basically all industries require graphics cards or graphical services.

I don't see neithe amd nor intel providing the same amount of tools and sources for graphical development and even then, nobody would double development cost including all tools, so most companies will stay with what the pipeline already uses unless intel or AMD provide VAST advancement over Nvidia which probably won't be the case within the next decade and especially intel has to recover from being kicked off the throne by AMD.

***Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is Nvidia’s main chip supplier***

*Nvidia is a leading semiconductor company primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the main external foundry that Nvidia relies on for chip production. However, it's important to note that the specific details and extent of their dependency can change over time due to various factors such as business strategies, and supply chain considerations.*

*Nvidia has been a major customer of TSMC for the production of its chips. TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and has a strong reputation for advanced manufacturing processes. Nvidia has utilized TSMC's fabrication facilities for several of its high-performance GPUs, including the latest generations.*

*Nvidia's reliance on TSMC for chip production can be attributed to various factors, such as TSMC's ability to provide cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, economies of scale, and capacity to meet Nvidia's production demands. The partnership between Nvidia and TSMC has been mutually beneficial, with TSMC benefiting from Nvidia's high-volume orders and Nvidia leveraging TSMC's expertise and manufacturing capabilities.*

*However, it's worth noting that Nvidia has also explored diversifying its chip production sources to mitigate risks and secure supply chains. They have partnered with other foundries like Samsung Electronics for the production of certain GPU models, which indicates an effort to reduce dependency on a single supplier.*",t3_13u29cy,1685393395.0,1

If Nvidia issued 100.000 shares in my example, the company and thereby the investors now would have an extra 100 billion in cash while getting diluted a mere 0.004%.  Technically that 100 billion would only represent a market cap/share price increase of an equivalent 0.004% but given that the company is overvalued, the company and investors are now locking in some of that inflated value.     

In an even more extreme example, imagine you own 10% unvested shares of a lemonade stand. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly values it at $1 trillion market cap. The stand then issues shares double its outstanding shares to raise $1 trillion in cash. Even if the market later corrects the stand's valuation, the stand, now with $1 trillion cash, is truly worth that much. As a shareholder, despite owning a smaller percentage, you benefit because the company's value has significantly increased. Thus, an inflated market value can be turned into real value.

It is not just Cruise.  This trend will continue.  Tesla made the same decision.   This is the future.   We have Apple making their own chips first for phones and then tablets and now laptops.

Amazon has started to make their own chips.

Google was already doing AI.  Now they are doing their phones and accounced a tablet also with their own chip.   Rumor is they will do laptops also with their own.

You will see this continue.   The entire calculus of the market has changed.  It is because the big guys are now so huge they can make the ROI to justify doing their own.

This will drive down margins for Nivdia.   So it is crypto and then this change in the market.  The EVGA is actually pretty small in comparison and is not fundemental like the other two.

The change is driven by the need for efficiency on the back end.   It use to be a company bought the chips, put it in a server, sold the server to someone.  Efficiency was not a priority.

Now the company that needs the chips is also paying the power bill.  So is why.  Google could never in a million years have what they have in production being used daily by literally billions of people for inference if they were using Nvidia chips.

This trend is only going to get a lot stronger as more models and much more compute intensive models are rolled out to production with billions of people using them.

Someone using Nvidia chips is just not going to be able to be competitive, IMO.  It is not just the upfront cost issue.  But the power bill.

High consumer demand for GPU:s (let’s say 10% above the mean) creates a demand effect of 2-4x that at the start of the supply chain. Which is indeed why supply has been bone dry. Even with increased demand over periods most companies manage to keep inventory, but as we know inventory turnover for NVDA has been extreme and lack of certain materials, supply chain problems etc further added to the lack of supply. And now the reverse is happening. This is the bullwhip effect when it changes direction. Demand retract (for whatever reason) and inventory skyrockets.

This effect is already clearly visible in many companies over several sectors and it is a micro-economic phenomena derived from macro factors. Simple as that.",t3_xhv73m,1663602608.0,1

Notably, it's discussing Nvidia's A100, which is surmised as the overall leader, despite being two years old—and notes that Nvidia has (by far and away) the best vertical stack (hardware & software) available.

Interestingly, Nvidia is advertising Hopper (the A100 successor, H100) as ""an order of magnitude faster than A100."" Of course, we'll see, but their GTC Keynote starts about 12 hours from this posting.

Google has successfully produced a (highly specialized) TPU that's really only good for their specific need, at (most likely) an enormous cost. GM noted that they were paying a premium for Nvidia's technology (driving platform), because of their low-volume. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that a low-volume platform from GM is instead going to be making their own connected-car platform—in fact, I worry for the overall speed and quality of that platform on future GM vehicles.",t3_xhv73m,1663641356.0,1

>Google for example started doing their own in 2015 and initially they were only for inference.

Google is actually one of few companies big enough to do custom AI training and inference chips.

&#x200B;

>The point with Cruise is that it is ANOTHER example of a company doing their own. Now even smaller companies.

Cruise made a parallel processing chip. It's a simple ASIC probably licensed from somewhere else. It's no where close to be as advanced as something Nvidia makes. Once inventory issues are cleaned up and GPU prices fall back down to earth, Nvidia will have a much better solution for car makers than whatever Cruise made. That's why it was stupid of Cruise to do this.

>This is pretty ridiculous as why would you do training on the phone? Google does the training in the cloud using TPUs. Which have been setting records.

I never said Google does training on a phone.

>There is zero doubt the incremental cost is far less than Nvidia.

You must be joking. Look at how many AI chip startups that require hundreds of millions of dollars of VC investment just to produce a single chip. And then probably billions more to manufacture and support that chip. And yet, none of them have shown to beat Nvidia's solutions with the exception of Cerebras for some specific AI acceleration.

9464,izhg7gd,t1_izf0xw5,"Assuming this is mostly a serious question. 

Charts are incredibly useful in understanding how a given asset or index behaves historically and what might be happening at a given moment. Charts are one tool of many. Technical traders rely on charts more than other traders might but any serious trader uses a chart  (value investors or anyone trading on fundamentals) there are several concepts that are almost universally used by active traders. Trendlines, resistance and support levels.  These things are all real and not voodoo. Trendlines show direction and can be drawn over periods ranging from minutes to decades. Support and resistance levels show levels that prices will bounce off for the upside and downside. Pushing through a level in either direction is also very meaningful. 

While it’s impossible to predict the future using charts, understanding how to read chart elements will help to optimize you entry and exit strategy’s for your positions. Since humans (or computer programmed by humans) are making decisions to buy or sell you can think of it like a map of market/human psychology. 

Within the chart the candles help to understand the price action and the conviction of the mmm those selling and those buying. Volume indicators help show the momentum behind the direction and can also be used to understand how liquid the underlying asset is. 

Personally I love reading charts and depending on the types of strategies, asset type and trading window use them all the time to manage risk and help determine when I enter and exit a trade. Also I use market sentiment, news, financial statements, stochastic indicators moving averages and sometimes instinct as part of my decision making process.

9480,j14yjka,t1_izhwrhr,"IMO There seems to be quite the historical trend, pandemic, booming growth, then market crash and recession. This happened with Spanish flu, roaring 20s and then the Great Depression. Same with sars in 2004 then great growth and obvs 2008. After these pandemics there’s a lot of spending or shift in monetary policy which boosts the economy from downturn caused by pandemic. Because of this boost and how easy it is to get or make money, banks like to find more ways to make money that aren’t as mainstream , therefore riskier assets become more enticing. One of these riskier assets was the subprime mortgage in 2008, they seemed like guaranteed money, so all banks got involved, but what happens when people can’t pay back their mortgages?( you get a market crash) . In the last couple of years the same has happened, except for FX swaps( a loan of one currency for another with a fixed future exchange rate) banks have been doing this like wildfire, taking advantage of low interest rates, and the fact that these don’t necessarily have to be accounted for. Because they aren’t showing on balance sheets they’ve gone under the radar for some time, and represent a great deal of risk. Now factor in that fed tightening doesn’t cause any shock to the market for 12-18 months, possibly causing global exchange rates to shift as the dollar is the world reserve.  Because fox swaps have fixed future exchange rates this can cause a great deal of trouble, and a lot of lost money depending on where rates go.

This is valuable because it allows you to gain the ability to purchase a decent amount of shares in a large timeframe without putting all the cash in now, and then options can usually be sold for more if you are correct about the price move in the right timeframe. You simply pay your premium and

Drawing lines can help indicate trends and consolidation but so can bollinger bands and just looking at the chart.

Same with a company like Netflix. They were innovative initially, but really haven’t had any technological enhancements that improve their product.

2. NVIDIA is prohibited from selling the cutting edge GPUs to China.
3. Such GPUs are capable of giving the west an advantage in not just economics, but in warfare (e.g. weather system predictions), weapons (missile design and guidance), cyber warfare, or even biological warefare.

Then the conclusion is that they *MUST* attack Taiwan soon to stop the disparity. However, if China has the impression that Intel can somewhat replace TSM (not completely but even partially), then such an attack is less attractive as it would be like cutting 3 heads off a 5 head hydra.

Meta is currently sitting at a 30+ P/FCF which people forgot this is a value stock. They have little room for growth with already 3.5 billion MAUs, they’re dependent on the cyclicality of the advertising market. 

I can live with missing out on Nvidia and Tesla, selling Microsoft and Meta too early, but I can’t live with giving up all of my gains because I held onto a stock that was overvalued for its fundamentals.

3.5 billion MAU is a problem for growth if your source of revenue comes from monthly subscription fees, for which the company has limited pricing power. Meta's revenue potential growth comes from ARPU.

WhatsApp, with 2+ billion MAU, has yet to be monetized at scale. Similar apps such as Kakao and WeChat were already monetizing at a level of 2-3$ per person more than 8 years ago.

I reviewed today on the news and decided not to sell any more. But I'm not buying at this level or recommending that anyone else do so. If there is a major further pullback in SP I may increase my position again.

The long-term growth story is mostly intact but is a little more questionable now. Datacenter is a 40% CAGR sector. I think only AMD is effectively competing with NVDA right now and there is a lot of growth to go around. The NVDA goal of monetizing software platforms I think warrants the risk of holding. AMD and INTC I don't see any potential outside of being hardware suppliers anytime soon. Nvidia *maybe* has what it takes to be the next Apple; AMD, Qualcomm I just can't imagine it.

Gaming and mining are coming off of a supercycle, but there will be another gaming supercycle (maybe the upcoming gen, maybe later) and Nvidia is still ridiculously entrenched there. It's an industry on a long-term growth trend. The moat will take at least a couple years to overcome if AMD or Intel (hah) can do it at all. I'm watching closely.

No one should discount the possibility of another GPU-based mining supercycle as we've already had 3 that I can recall. I don't know if it's causation, coincidence, or conspiracy, but the last 3 crypto runs and GPU mining booms seem to coincide with major GPU performance leaps. AMD Hawaii in 2019 (BTC), Pascal and Vega in 2016, peaking 2017 (ETH), Ampere in 2020 (ETH). Yes, BTC is not GPU mineable now and ETH is going to obsolete GPU mining soonish(?) but I can't predict whether people will decide some other imaginary GPU coin is worth a lot of real money again.

It isn't just politicians who are using anti-China rhetoric to get votes. It's also the western mainstream media.

Just write ""China bad"" and automatically get 2x more views and clicks.

When was the last time you read something positive or even neutral on China in the mainstream media? I can't remember the last time. Probably before Trump.

1.4 billion people and not a single positive thing happens in China, according to Western media.

Show a Chinese person being happy? Must be CCP propaganda.

You didn't automatically say ""China bad""? CCP shill.

Show a Chinese company having international success? Must have stolen the tech.

Social media app that US teens love to use? China must doing mass surveillance on Americans.

This sort of black and white demonizing of China creates extremist views. You can see these extremist views on China all over Reddit, including /r/stocks. Heck, [I just got blamed on  r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ojkpc/comment/jl51hl8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for the war on Ukraine because I didn't write ""China bad"".

People are so concerned and fearful of pro-China propaganda that they don't even realize they've been drinking propaganda from the other side as well.

In turn, stocks will suffer because of extremist views. Stocks (except military stocks) and your economic well being benefit more from US/China peace. Politicians and mainstream media benefit more from scaring you.

* Mainstream media gets more views and clicks by generating fear, anger and saying ""China bad""
* Your view of China turns negative over time
* Politicians need your vote in order to advance their careers
* Politicians say ""China bad"" to get your votes
* Media quotes politicians saying ""China bad""
* Your view of China turns even more negative
* Politician's approval ratings are down
* Politician says ""China bad"" to distract you
* Your view of China turns worse

Because of this endless cycle, it's career suicide for a US politician to not be anti-China. Any US politician objectivity on China has been lost since 2016.

And it's not like there are alternative media since the media landscape has consolidated into a handful of powerful conglomerates.

I know some will accuse me of being anti-western or pro-CCP below. No. I'm not. I'm anti-extremists. I believe that the world is safer, better, happier, more prosperous when views are moderate and not extreme. In turn, my own economic well being and my investments in stocks will increase.

9938,jl5ifog,t1_jl5b1w0,"Idk I agree some what. however I think the horizon for China to come out ahead is far more distant than the US. If China continues this route they'll ostracize themselves with the hope of becoming self reliant. China is likely decades behind the US in terms of chip production. No top fabs or even top companies and definitely lack of qualified personnel ( hence the Us ban). The US understands this.

The Us does have the means and is current producing top chips. 

That being said , what matters most in chips is overall efficiency and productivity. Since there isn't really a market for 3rd place generic chips ( which generic ""2nd or 3rd"" place quality are chinas specialty,) China will suffer. Theres no second place for AI or quantum computing, all that matters is the best of the best. While companies like Nvidia lack the scale as of now, they're leaps ahead of where China is currently at. China not only needs and NVidia right now but also the scale. That's a long shot.

The exception to this is TSMC - which we all know brings all the drama. Should China posses this with able bodied individuals, that would be a game changer as they're the largest *producer* .

It’s cheaper and less risky to just maintain the hardware.

Even on the more modern languages, lots of the businesses have lost the source code for many of their applications and don’t want to risk re-development.

Only in very recent years have compilers/interpreters been good enough that you (usually) don’t have to care about which architecture you’re running on, and that computers have been powerful enough to make emulation fast enough for general use.",t3_y16xfg,1665545620.0,1

Currently, Nvidia can't even make enough of its A100/800 and H100/800 chips to meet all the world's wide demands.  If this goes through, it just means that most the compute power will supply Western demands first, and the black market will supply China's demands after.  So even in the short term I don't see this affecting Nvidia growth projection.

> When it comes to banning certain items, the law of supply and demand suggests that if the supply of an item is restricted through a ban, while the demand for it remains unchanged, its price will increase. This is because there are still people who want to buy the item, but there are fewer available for purchase. As a result, those who are willing and able to pay more for the item will be able to purchase it, while others will not.

The bigger issues are Intel is significantly less efficient at manufacturing wafers than TSMC. Intel requires more fab space for the same output due to lower tool utilization rates and worse yields. To catch up with AMD they made cores larger with more transistors that guzzle more power to achieve similar performance. Based on Intel's presentation to address all these problems now they are going to rapidly shrink nodes twice Intel 4/3 and Intel 20A/18A.

Smartphone and datacenter chips will continue to be dominated by the supplier with best performance, which is TSMC for now, but the silicon market is big. 28nm is old tech but going to stay relevant for a very long time because of the extreme design costs and wafer of cutting edge chips that is only getting worse.

* Plans mean nothing, all that matters is execution. I invested in a small company with a great product and huge plans, but scaling up production is difficult and when it didn't work out, the stock dropped 90%. Likewise, there are plenty of companies (*cough* GM *cough*) that are talking about their plans everyday, but not executing whatsoever and going bankrupt as a result. So the lesson here is that, unless a company has an amazing track record of executing on plans, look at what they're doing, not what they say they will do.
* Unlike what people say around here, diversifying by owning more stocks is not safer. As a retail investor, and especially when just starting out, you don't have time to truly follow more than a handful of companies. It's much safer to own 1 or 2 stocks you know really well, than 10 stocks you only know the basics of.",t3_y09upx,1665410432.0,13

10282,irt8j6g,t3_y09upx,"So I'm just a novice, but this is advice I get from
my successful father every time I try and talk
stocks with him. People only enjoy trading
because they enjoy money. It is an unnatural
profession. People enjoy hobby's via their
passions.... Woodworking, skiing, cooking, etc. all
of which can never be fully mastered and one
may spend a lifetime pursuing greatness in.
Stocks on the other hand, are not interesting at
all, well atleast to 99.99999% of the population,
even 99.999% of an educated population, the
ONLY reason it is popular is because SOME
people make money doing it. So his point is, if
one can never be too good at something, why
waste the time and energy on something that
isn't your passion? The opportunity cost of
investing in individual stocks is that it takes time
and money away from perfecting your actual
craft, hobby, or profession. A boat craftsman
loses out on his primary skills every second he
wastes trying to understand the stock market,
especially ""better"" than others. Why not invest in
the S&P 500 and never look at stocks, and be
able to advance your self personally and
professionally, become more skilled, and live and
enjoyable fulfilling life. Instead of reading 10k's
and worrying all the time. It's that simple.
Specialize, find what you like or you are good at
and grind endlessly at it. Stop and enjoy life,
pursue new skills. There are some brainiacs that
genuinely enjoy trading and finance, but from my
personal opinion there are less of those in the
world than there are people in this sub. So yeah,
take it from my main man, and myself trying to
follow on his footsteps. Enjoy life, never stop
grinding, pursue your passions, and don't let distractions get to you, because unless you're a
professional, even investing can be a distraction.
Good luck to all of you.",t3_y09upx,1665437104.0,2

The thing is if I got stopped out at the start of the year I’d have jumped back in not long after that thinking it was a great price, but the dip.

In investing, you behave like an owner of the public company and try to measure it's present value based on future cashflows. Here, you develop a philosophical context of how market (& capitalism generally supposed to work) and try to pay a price for mathematical positive expectations in return. It's alot of subjective guesswork. Here, win rate is marginally higher due to collective economical favor but when shit hits fan, you are wiped out. Grass always looks greener the other side

Other hand, there's no such thing as great price in trading. You are basically looking for spreads there. For example:

Let's say a stock made an ATH at 190, you buy it, keep a stop at 150. From here, two things can happen - 1) either stock drops to 140 & you lose the amount you bet (which by design should be insignificant, less than 2%) then you wait for a new ATH& buy at that new ATH repeating the entire process or 2) stock drops to 170 then continue higher without hitting your stoploss. 

This is just an example, there's 1000+ strategies out there for trading. Strategies don't make money, it's your decision making process that makes money.

In trading, you don't ""think"" or ""guess"" anything. It's if-else exit conditional decision making ideology. You will often make small losses and occasional big gains (those big gains pay for losses and other trading related costs & whatever left is your profit). There you build a trading system that has positive expectancy over long term with entry & exit rule, adjust position sizes based on historical volatility & calculate risk you want to take (say 1% per position), diversify your positions & you must religiously follow that system for next three decades or even more with little to no change.

>If that was easy we’d be doing other things

Trading is never easy. In some systems such as trend following, you have a win rate of less than 50%. Think of this - 2 stoploss hit in 4 trades and most will give up there but it gets worse from here. How about three whips in row? 3 continuous stops in 8 trades, 4 cluster stoploss hit every 16 trades, 5 cluster stoploss hit in every 32 trades...

how good you will be executing your system precisely after 5 stoploss hit in a row? That's the challenge in the short term markets. If you risk big (over 20% equity per position), you will be wiped out in just 4 trades",t3_y09upx,1665435726.0,1

Their NRI has just increased by 2,2% every year,  their NAV has about 6%. Their dividends are about 8% and have been decreasing every year, even when its only 42% of their NRI

Yes. I have tried that once in emerging markets in 2015 - 2018, but I didn't see any significant difference in return (also created more volatility). However, it doubled win rate and eliminated value traps but returns were mediocre on average stocks.

Momentum is under-reaction to good news whereas value is over-reaction to bad news. So I suppose both were cancelling risk/return skew when combined. I advise against using momentum with value personally.

>You may have something with that low p/s, have you tried any combinations with anything else?

No, it was raw [price to sales](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/rsi/psratio.htm) and nothing else. Because I believe in order to be cheap, they really have to be ugly looking for the market. So I just bought the cheapest decile of value (holding period of 2Y or sell at 100% gain). I didn't beat the index but returns were positive overall.

There’s a severe resistance level above formed by the upper band of the descending channel on the SPX. Technically, we’re almost certain to be headed for the 100 short term. After that, I know 4100 is on the top end of a lot of analysts range… good resistance at 3900-3915. If we get two closes about that level it’s higher to that 41 handle, but if it’s rejected then we pause until next months data.. possible PCE or FOMC as a catalyst before that. Ultimately though, we should be down to 3200 in a realistic world. Lots of forward expectations have to work out perfectly for these values to be justified historically.

Having said all that: tomorrow? Something in me says we should be lower for consolidation. But the indexes hit the highs of the day on the close; there are simply no more sellers and the buyers have taken control.

There are plenty of great CEOs that made incredible turnarounds, this sub only focus on the most well known companies, some of which have such powerful brands that don't require a great CEO to maintain their market position.

Google CEO is also terrible. They literally didn't innovate at all, it's still just the search engine. All attempts to diversify were huge failures. Google Cloud is a joke. Youtube is just a good acquisition but that's all.

Zuckemberg is losing money with that stupid metaverse and he's such a big weirdo and nutcase. He also allowed TikTok to take over their core business despite enjoying huge benefits as a monopolist in the sector with high switching costs.

Amazon still didn't find a way to have decent margins on their e-commerce business despite the fact they had almost a monopoly for over a decade and it's been 30 years that the e-commerce platform has been created. And. AWS is slowing down.

Nvidia is a meme stock nowadays that was extremely lucky to ride the crypto boom. What merit the CEO has to just be lucky enough to sell the GPUs that then found an application for mining coins? Just luck, they didn't create the GPU because of crypto, they produced them for a completetely different segment. Revenues have pummeled and people that praise it didn't even look at the balance sheet. I'll argue with anybody on here who tell me that Nvidia balance sheet is in good shape. In May 2022  they reported revenues of 8,3 billions....in October 2022 revenues 5,9 billions...they literally collapsed despite the inflation.

May 2022 EBITDA 3,55 billions, Jun 2022 EBITDA 770 millions....LOL

He never able to revive mobile, lost big on AR, and I don’t know about other folks but bing still sucks. We don’t need bing. ChatGPT v4 and above can integrate with any UX and will work so not sure why bing need to be lump up with it. m365, GitHun and LinkedIn are much better prospect for ChatGPT integration. 

I think Sundar is downright poor CEO. He is basically Indian version of Ballmer. He became too complicit and results are infront of us.

You clearly don't know anything about Elon.

He's the #1 CEO by far. No one comes close.

He helped start PayPal. Then he got involved with rockets. He wanted to buy one from a Russian representative but they laughed at him for being a novice so he decided to build his own: SpaceX. At that time, NASA was consistently over budget and weren't really innovating. SpaceX has saved the U.S. government tens of billions by reducing space travel cost. SpaceX alone has done more rocket launches than any other country.

Starlink provides a strong wireless connection from just about anywhere in the world. Countries that have no internet connection (rural countries) are able to use the internet which could change the lives of many people in poverty. It's also a significant tool when there is a natural disaster and you need to connect to rescuers, family, friends, etc.,

Tesla was started when no one wanted to get involved with EV's because it was 'impossible' to mass manufacture and become a sustainable business. Elon knew nothing about EV's. He's managed to turn Tesla into the largest EV company, the #1 most profitable automaker in the U.S. (beating out GM/Ford despite GM/Ford being a company for nearly a century), and their energy generation/storage is a revolutionary product that will change how energy is used in the future. 

The fact is, you'll be hard-pressed to find a CEO in any era that has accomplished what Musk has done. Check the facts. ""Memes and hype."" Lol. Vanguard owns 6% of Tesla.

Incorrect. AI is the next evolution of search, be it in chatbot form or any other form. Google had an absolutely massive headstart in AI 5-10 years ago, and Sundar squandered that market advantage. He even did a shit job of monetizing it.

With globalization likely to take a step back for the forseeable future due to tensions between China and the West seemingly at ATHs every other day and a structural commodity bull market, inflation is going to remain elevated for a veeery long time.

Couple that with QE and other financial babysitting tools the Fed has gotten the market addicted to over the last decade and now has neither the will nor the ability to leverage as it used to. ( Like, look over the last decade; SPY, QQQ and whatnot have an almost 100% correlation with how much QE is happening).

Not to even mention the glut of zombie companies  that have accumulated over this last bull run. I don't even want to think about Europe or China's housing market. We were already at very precarious levels before Covid; now the markets are even higher with an economy that is unequivocally more vulnerable.

In summary; structurally high inflation, removal of financial tools like QE, way too much debt in the system... We may see short to mid-term rallies but the foundations are not solid. Numbers on a chart do not change the underlying weaknesses in the  world economy. I'm being very cautious.",t3_wfjx4f,1659607822.0,0

11081,iixluk9,t3_wfjx4f,"General sentiment seems to be that:
(1) Fed took away most of the money they needed to from investors to make up for some of the money printed
(2) Fed is going to run the market up in advance of elections for the Democrats.   I think that is crazy bc I find it hard to believe they think that so many investors will forget what happened early in the year.   But I guess they can still try 
(3) There's always a pullback when there's Fed activity.   We have been in a U shaped bowl type market.   Bottom was mainly May-June.   Some stragglers kept falling in July.   Will continue to see the same in coming months.  But for the most part, we are seeing higher highs and higher lows.  So expect September to be a small bump in the road
(4).  Everyone was predicting SPY to fall to 320.   That's what puzzles me.   If it happens, it will happen after elections bc of a recession.

Vice versa when you short it. When you buy an option, you’re betting that it will go up/down by a certain amount and by a certain date.

So if I buy GOOGL 120c 11/09 I’m buying the rights to 100 shares or GOOGL at a price of $120 per share. If, on August 11, the price of GOOGL is less than $120, my options are worthless. I might as well buy those shares on the regular market for cheaper. If it’s above $120 though, I can exercise my options and buy those shares at a cheaper price than anyone else who doesn’t have an option.

If you’ve spent the last 12 years buying companies with <1bn mkt caps, low p/b, low p/s, low EV/E, low p/FCF and selling when those numbers got high, you’ve absolutely outperformed companies like Tesla, Google, Apple, or whatever.

1. Flat Revenue growth YoY (3% growth from Aug 21). Declining Revenue growth Quarter over quarter. It went from 8.3B to 6.7B in the last earnings release. 

2. Spiking cost of revenue. This was 2.3B Aug 21. It's now at 3.8B in the last earnings. It's also increasing quarter over quarter. 

3. This leads to a huge decline to gross profit. 4.2B a year ago to 2.9B today. Same picture with Quarter over Quarter. 

4. Operating expenses have also ballooned. 1.8B a year ago to 2.4B today. This means they posted only 500M of operating income, compared to 2.5B a year ago.

5. NVDA announced that their Q3 outlook is only 5.9B in revenue. That's another quarter of steep decline. I doubt they'll be able to reduce cost fast enough to keep up. I would expect them to lose money next quarter. BTW - I don't believe this estimate was done after the executive order to stop supplying China with their chips.

6. The PE as of today's closing price is around 40. For a company to be worth 40 PE, you need to show 25%+ revenue growth IMO. So you need to see 9.5B. I am not hopeful that they can go from 5.9B next quarter to 9.5B by end of 2023. 


A company with <5% Revenue growth (and decelerating) and quickly eroding margin does not deserve 40PE. I would expect it to be around 13x-15x PE. So based on this analysis, I would think a fair market value for NVDA is around $60. Another 55%-60% decrease in price.",t3_xjelj6,1663713857.0,25

**Can chip giant NVIDIA shrug off China sales ban?**

***The share price for chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA) has fallen more than 53% year-to-date***

Analysts have reduced their price targets after the company revised down its earnings outlook in August, and the US government-imposed restrictions on NVIDIA selling chips to China and Russia.

*Is now a good time to trade the stock?*

**History of NVIDIA**

NVIDIA was founded in the US in 1993 by electrical engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Huang currently serves as the company’s CEO, Malachowsky remains a senior executive and Priem retired from the company in 2003.

NVIDIA invented the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in 1999, a high-performance processor that generates interactive graphics for virtual reality, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI).

NVIDIA reported its first $1bn-revenue quarter in 2007 and shipped its 1 billionth graphics processor in 2011.

In September 2020, the company announced plans to acquire UK chip designer Arm from Japanese investment firm SoftBank (9984) for $40bn. However, the deal collapsed under opposition from UK regulatory authorities, with NVIDIA announcing the termination of the transaction on 7 February 2022.

On 6 May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed a $5.5m settlement with NVIDIA over the company’s failure to disclose in 2018 that cryptocurrency mining was a significant source of revenues from sales of its GPUs designed for gaming.

NVIDIA stock slumps on as trade war compounds slowdown

Based on NVDA stock historical prices, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $334.12 on 29 November 2021, with lockdowns around the world increasing demand for computing and entertainment systems. The stock had been trading around $51 in March 2020 at the start of pandemic-related restrictions.

The share price began to retreat as technology stocks sold-off heading into 2022. NVDA started the year at $301.21 a share and dropped to $219.44 on 27 January. It rebounded to $267.05 on 9 February and $286.56 on 29 March, but began to fall sharply in April as analysts started to downgrade the stock on signs of slowing consumer demand for GPUs and concerns about the impact of high inflation.

Technology stocks have borne the brunt of stock market selloffs, as central banks, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed), have begun aggressively raising interest rates and some investors have shifted from stocks to fixed-income assets.

The NVDA share price fell to the $161 level in May and despite an uptick to $195.92 in June, continued to decline, reaching $145.23 on 1 July. The stock rose to $192.15 on 4 August, but was unable to hold at that level.

On 24 August, NVIDIA reported revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended 31 July of $6.7bn, up 3% from the same period in 2021, but down 19% from the previous quarter. Earnings per share fell to $0.26, down by 72% from a year earlier and 59% lower than the previous quarter.

Jensen Huang said:

“We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.”

The share price rose from $171.81 on 23 August to $179.13 on 25 August, but at least 14 Wall Street analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock on 25 August amid expectations of lower projected growth, weighing on the share price as investors sold the stock in response. The share price ended the month at $150.94.

NVDA dropped to $139.37 on 1 September in response to an SEC filing that the US government had informed the company on 26 August of a new license requirement for exports to China and Russia for the company’s A100 and H100 integrated circuits and any products that incorporate them.

The government indicated that the license is intended to “address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‘military end use’ or ‘military end user’ in China and Russia.”

NVIDIA said that it “does not sell products to customers in Russia,” but “the new license requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete its development of H100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of A100 and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China.”

Based on the outlook NVIDIA provided for its third fiscal quarter in its results on 24 August, approximately $400m in potential sales to China could be subject to the new license requirement, the company said in the filing.

The NVDA share price subsequently dropped to $134.65 on 6 September, its lowest level since March 2021. The stock then ticked higher to close at $139.90 on 8 September.

What is the outlook for the NVIDIA share price after the selloff? Can it rebound or will it remain under pressure? Let’s look at some future predictions from analysts.

Several Wall Street analysts downgraded their stock expectations in response to the US government’s licensing requirements.

Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein lowered their price target to $180 from $210 on 1 September. On 2 September, Daiwa Capital Markets reduced its target to $133 from $215, downgrading the stock from outperform to neutral, while Needham & Company lowered its stock projection to $170 from $185.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank declined to provide a forecast until there are more details available, noting:

“At a time when demand uncertainties are already rising across the semi sector, and rapidly expanding from Consumer markets to the Data Center, we expect these new trade restrictions to add additional investor angst regarding chip demand/growth prospects. We expect the impact on NVDA to be largest amongst the US processor companies, given the company’s leadership position in HPC/AI.”

When evaluating any NVIDIA stock 5-year forecast, you should keep in mind that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research.

What's to stop AWS creating their own AI optimised GPUs and a CUDA-like API?

And for gaming I assume their moat is even weaker. The latest generation of consoles already use AMD GPUs, so if I'm correct it's literally just high-end PC gamers who game on NVDA GPUs and presumably that's only because AMD's graphics cards fall slightly short when compared to NVDA's.

AWS is about cloud computing, not developing the hardware itself. Amazon has to purchase those servers to provide that service 

Again AWS is not a hardware segment of Amazon. They don’t have that manufacturing capability or probably even the talent (money can only go so far)

I also own AMD. The thing is AMD and NVDA is a duopoly when it comes to GPUs now.

But this also why both companies are competing in AI, simulation, and data. AMD didn’t have that capability until they acquired Xilinx (however it’s spelled) and that was fairly recently 

NVDA has some incredible engineers that generally pioneer the graphic and physics space of computing. It’s hard to get that type of talent AND the manufacturing infrastructure to make it a reality 

It’s really only been the last 5-10 years that AMD has challenged them and in my opinion, they’ve been playing catch-up.

11493,ip9oytb,t1_ip8u2e7,"I wouldn't say INTC were complacent, as much as they just chose the wrong strategy and since they were vertically intergrated it bit them hard in the ass. Namely INTC failed miserably when it came to the 7nm processor.  As a result since they were vertically integrated going back to the drawing board basically killed them, since that meant they had to re-tool the fabs (which they owned and operated) which not only takes years, but costs a shit ton of money.

AMD didn't have to deal with any of that, TSMC makes their chips.

It got so bad, that Intel is now going to TSMC for chip manufacturing.  Nvidia is attempting a similar strategy by releasing the Founders Editions and the failed aquistion of ARM.

The problem is that Nvidia may be running into serious issues with distribution. Huge issues actually.

For one, the allocation of resources traditionally would fall on the shoulders of the AIBs.  With one of the biggest and most well known AIBs out of the picture (EVGA) they'll have to pick up the slack when it not only comes to that, but also dealing with the end product experience.

While before they had to deal with the Founder Editions, which was a premium product, they now will have to deal with a larger swath. That means higher than anticipated costs in manufacturing (energy prices going up, rare earth minerals are more in demand) and also in distribution. Not just with retailers and vendors either, we are talking about everything from warranties, to bugs and defects.

While before they could easily offload this to their AIBs, if they become the main source of manufacturing then they will also have to take this part of the business on.   As seen by the exit of EVGA more AIBs may see this as a moment of leverage to move against Nvidia as well, which means that Nvidia may have to either give up control to the AIBs which can translate to less profits.

Finally, the AI and data center markets are largely going to require cheap chips, not expensive chips. It's what made Nvidia so good at AI in the first place.  AI requires a lot of simple calculations done very, very quickly. Similar to bitcoin mining.  Which again, is why GPUs are so excellent. They are great for executing simple commands, at very large volumes, at very high speeds. 

The question is will the market want to spend a premium for a card/chip that can do that? Or will another manufacturer that is a bit slower, that can handle maybe fewer processes become more relevant.

Don't forget, AMD still isn't the fastest, Intel is, but plenty of people like the price point, the easy upgradibilty of the echo system around the CPU and are perfectly having a slower chip with more cores to deal with the the tasks they have.

Which is why the ARM deal was such a huge deal. They would have basically owned the low end and the high end of the market. Hence why it was rejected as well.

So Nvidia has lost its value for good reason, also similar to Intel.

Leaning too heavily on vertical integration and the failure to implement their strategy being the main ones.  Same things Intel did.  

Also, and this is a big one, cloud computing is more and more viable and mobile gaming is the largest sectors of the gaming market.  Meaning that if Nvidia can't penetrate those markets then the decline is inevitable.

You don't need an Nvidia chip to play Candy Crush (which is one of the most profitable games still today, literally over a billion dollars *per year*).  What you do need is a cheaper chip, like the Snapdragon, which what they were aiming for with ARM. Which failed.",t3_xjelj6,1663720873.0,7

11507,ip9pfde,t1_ip9j7u2,"A couple things -

The reason PS5 and Xbox use Amd is a cost to performance tradeoff.  They have to keep the cost down for consoles to be affordable. The also don't care about power cost as consumers don't really pay attention to thay.

Server/Data Centers have 2 major cost - the hardware and the electricity.  Your comment that they can just use more, less efficient chips does hold up because of the electricity cost to run the chips AND cool the data center. Data Centers need the most efficient and powerful chips to keep the Electricity costs down.  The hardware is a one time cost.  The power cost is re-occurring and becomes a huge deal. If NVDA chips are so much better that you need 10 of their GPUs for a certain application but would need 15 that were less efficient/powerful that is 1.5x or more the power usage which is a re-occuring cost.

The other major item is that individual companies like Amazon, Google etc should NOT be developing their own chips unless it is a competitive advantage for their business and something they can monetize.  Let's say for a minute they could do it.  Once you account for the lower number of chips they would make and the ongoing support costs around new versions, code updates etc you will very quickly reach a point where making your own chips is more expensive per unit because you are spreading the R&D across fewer units.

The other big issue with other companies trying to make their own chips is they will need someone like TSMC to make the chips.  TSMC is already producing at  full capacity so you would need to wait for more capacity to come online or pay a lot more to buy the capacity to support making your chips.

There are HUGE barriers to entry in the Semiconductor space especially if you make your own chips.  It takes tens of  billions and years to get a foundry up and running.

Aapl decided to make their own chips because they sell enough units to make it worth while because they are consumer facing products and have magnitudes more than a data center would have. The also had to plan ahead and TSMC is making the chips for them.",t3_xjelj6,1663721086.0,6

Will it go back to ATH? Not any time soon IMO. We may see north of 200 after the end of  the tightening cycle, and we go back to easy money, but that will be in 5 years or more.

What happens to the stock depends on the growth story that nvidia puts forward. Can nvidia justify having an inflated P/E? Right now, no.

I say this as someone holding 100 shares of nvidia at 240$. I would not have paid 240$ for nvidia; it was a gamble on a put that bit me when Brainard came out overly hawkish early in the year, and the stock tanked over 60$ in a day. Due to some life issues I was unable to buy back the put before it was assigned. I have been contemplating selling since, but kept selling CCs on the rallies. I am still thinking of selling, since the downside potential of nvidia right now could easily put it under 100$/share for years.

Short term -> Downside to less than 100$/share.

They’ve been shifting focus heavily toward data center and AI. Gaming is still a large contributor to their revenue stream, and will continue to be meaningful, but you can’t use current gaming revenue figures interchangeably with crypto. 

People here saying crypto is the reason Nvidia is going down are entitled to their opinion, but I think that’s misleading. Sure, crypto is a part of it because it impacts investor sentiment (as evident by this thread), but a bigger part of it is macro supply chain issues, China’s restricted economy, higher interest rates and yields, and concerns of a recessionary environment weighing on the chip sector.

TL;DR Crypto only makes up 2% of Nvidia’s current revenue; making dramatic price target calls on Nvidia’s crypto revenue is probably the wrong way to look at it.

I consider cryptos a long term investment.  I cashed out in April at +1000% (most of my buys were doing periods of downwards price action).    The fact that something is down in a short period more than another asset doesn't mean that it is a poor investment going forward.

In the United States, a recession is defined as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.""[3] The European Union has adopted a similar definition.[4][5] In the United Kingdom, a recession is defined as negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.[6][7]",t3_145049d,1686348025.0,-1

It’s too long, which means that if this is a secular bear market, you probably go double top with the ATH before starting a new downslide. 

The bull case is that we didn’t see the end of the secular bull market that’s been led by tech stocks last year after all by the way. And right now, it’s a deal where macro says no, but technicals say yes to that case.

They’re now down -16% from that earning report.

11856,jcblaud,t1_jca06lq,"You have to pay a high P/E for companies with great earnings growth. If a company's earnings were constant every year, then valuing it based on its P/E and comparing its earnings to T bills as an alternative makes a lot of sense. 

However, NVDA had a P/E of 60 when it cost $30/share in 2017, now it has a P/E of $135, but it costs $235 a share. There is no way NVDA was overvalued at a P/E of 60 6 years ago. It's earnings growth was tremendous then. It has fallen off lately with the crash of crypto and coins that don't need proof-of-work, and ASICs that are better for that purpose. Obviously, NVDA's share price has exploded since the release of chatgpt and people think that the need to train AI on its GPUs will keep its earnings growing. NVDA has an okay moat. AMD and AAPL are other supposedly overvalued stocks that can make GPUs, but they haven't invested in making a language that can replace CUDA's dominance in the AI-in-the-cloud field. But, ever stock with a high P/E will have wild swings, usually in tandem with the S&P. In the long run, you will probably make your money back, but you will ride through many paper gains and paper losses and if you might need your money soon, then you can't afford to hold a high p/e company. 

In contrast, stocks that looked good to first order on paper, like SVIB, with its accountants crafting it to have a P/E of 4.18, were overvalued and the massive amounts of cash that were leaving the bank were buried deep in their quarterly report. Any stock that is at risk of bankruptcy is the true overvalued asset, and their charts usually look like a slow exponential decay.",t3_11rs2c6,1678902446.0,13

Nvidia is a good company that in an emerging industry that will likely come to dominate all other industries. But the supply chains and end products are still immature. You can't flog $50k of tensor processors to any idiot off the street like you can with a car. 

Sure Nvidia might be overvalued short term given market conditions. But their moat is a lot bigger than most people realize - there is a lot of hardware and software ip.

11878,jca10sv,t1_jc9xf9f,"I actually really like home builders. 

In a world where existing home sales are constrained because current owners don't want to trade in a 3% mortgage for a 7% (this will be even further constrained if house prices go down and people's equity is squeezed out), home builders are in a great position to fill the marginal demand. 

We're ""apparently"" still in a housing shortage, and material prices have been coming down. Sure, it could affect margins if home prices fall, but home builders were operating at 15-20% margins the last few years, when historically, they're typically operated under 10%. So they've got plenty of room to spare, even if home prices do fall (which, honestly, I don't think they'll fall that much - unless we get an absolute glut of inventory).

So as long as existing home supply is constrained, home builders should be able to capture most of the current demand.

My apologies that some people are risk averse and not out here shorting stocks and playing options.

11976,jceg513,t1_jcdlh0p,"In the example above, I intentionally picked a point when NVDA was at an all-time high, with a P/E of 60. If a company doubling in valuation three times in 6 years despite halving in P/E valuation along the way is suffering, then sign me up. But, I hear you. I used to own NVDA and the swings were stressful.  If they weren't, I would be far better off still holding it now. The sell now and jump back in later impetus was too strong for me. 

There are many companies with names that you know right now that will have-thousand percent returns in your lifetime. In my lifetime, I regret not holding AMZN, NFLX (sell now or earlier) and GOOG, and instead taking profits, while not jumping back in during lower prices. That is a different form of suffering. But, in general, high growth means high volatility, and the market will never let you get away with big returns without taking on a big long-term risk. If you want to do 60% stocks 40% bonds, then some of your stocks should be growth stocks that you believe in. 

I wouldn't advocate buying NVDA right now, at overbought conditions. APPL has all the cash it needs in a liquidity crunch with a P/E of 25, and Tim APPL could decide to launch more affordable AI-in-the-cloud system-on-a-chip servers with a version of the Metal shading language that gains market share in the AI-community. AAPL could release its self-driving car and VR headset (which is probably fluff unless its tracking is so good that it doesn't make you sick).

I can tell you why MAPS was a bad idea, the whole premise hinged on government regulation, and the notion that “this sucker is going up” and that should not be the reason you invest. It was pure speculation. That’s why I don’t speculate anymore and look at earnings, growth over the last 10 years,  yields, and most importantly determining if the price is right.

Autopilot is arguably a failure or success, depending on what you think think the relevant goalposts are and the possibility of future improvement is.

Tesla lives and dies by the car business.  If they're able to come out with a competitive 25k sedan with enough margin, I start seeing a better growth story. If they're able to produce a pickup that competes with the big 4 economically, I start seeing a better growth story.

It'd be worth it to see which companies are expanding and buying commercial real estate, as any expansion COULD be seen as a sign of growth, or at the very least, a bubble period. If the company continues to do well, you'll see an increase in revenue, which can only be good for investors. If not, you can still hold out maybe an 8 month bubble? I mean, the rising stock price could last longer than that, but usually a company will know within its first year of expansion whether or not that was a sustainable cost, indicative of employee number growth, and the ability to still meet quarterly fiscal goals and market predictions.
I'd pay close attention to metropolitan real estate, especially. It's a little easier to read about and stay updated on when any expansion like that will be having job openings published in their local news papers, and it's just easier to research that way, as there's just MORE business in metropolitan areas. So, condense your search down to one area that you can track thoroughly and frequently, and I think you have the best chance at finding the stocks that are right for you, instead of trying to follow market trends and analyses.

Critical Elements ($CRECF) has...

1  All permits Federal+provincial

2  Signed agreements with Cree indigenous tribes

3. ""Green"" power via hydroelectric (cheap power to run the plant) + nearby roads for transport - meaning less startup costs since they don't have to build roads to the mine

4. Two Execs who built a previous  lithium mining company and sold it for 6 billion

5  High quality lithium deposits (among the best) = easier refining

6. Huge support from Quebec - they want Quebec to become a major player in lithuim since they have great deposits in the area

7.  100% owned land 1000 sq. miles with other likely deposits available (will do more exploratory drilling this year)

8. 17 year mine life with excellent profit margins

9. Feasibility study shows profitable (break even in 2 years) at $4500/ton USD...current price has dropped by half from its peak last year and is still $46k/ton. 

10. skilled labor pool - In Quebec, mining is a major industry 

11. Stable economy/government - Low political risk as Qubec has recently announced a major push/funding to advance critical minerals industry

12. company has been around for over 10 years, most of those just getting through environmental/permitting. They are the only fully permitted miner who hasn't already broken ground in Canada. ETA building plant and site prep in 2024, producing in 2025.

13. good stock structure. some dilution when Execs execute options but much below average


Recent events""

- hiring key roles in mine building

- approval to move power line that ran right over the top if their mine

- are currently seeking strategic partner to help fund start up costs, roughly $400 million with well over $2billion return, just on the existing mine. 

- VW is building their mega battery factory in Ontario...huge customer right in their own backyard. : https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/volkswagen-and-powerco-to-build-north-american-battery-factory-in-canada/amp/

- tock was just included in a newly created lithium ETF..should help raise stock as more interest enters the fray


Obsolescence outlook: Most ""upcoming"" battery tech still involves lithium like solid state batts. Sodium batts are too heavy, hydrogen infrastructure is decades off and any new tech would at this point  take years to scale and Safety test, etc. Lots of b.s. battery hype videos on YouTube, but they all ""require new tech breakthroughs"" that haven't happened yet and have other drawbacks like short cycle life.


investor prospectus; https://www.cecorp.ca/en/presentation/


stock is at $1.77/share  USD ""CRECF"" ...with 5 analysts rating it undervalued with a $3.50ish current price target.


Future stock catalysts...

- announcement of funding this year

- guaranteed lithium shortage over the next 3-7 years: https://www.google.com/amp/s/investingnews.com/amp/lithium-demand-keep-ballooning-2658832264

- push toward North America materials sourcing (most refined lithium currently mined in Uaustraila, Chile, Argentina, then shopped to China for refining and battery production).

Nuclear is unsafe and unclean and is the most expensive form, bar none.  The industry only cares about the 15-20 year construction phase because that's where they mint all their profits.  They turn the reactors over to lowest bid humans who inevitably make human errors and leave catastrophes behind that never get cleaned properly.  

The builds release all their massive amount of carbon up front during construction.  That means they don't become carbon neutral into year 20+ of operation, and the plants are only coming with 30 year design life.  So mass builds would actually accelerate our GHG crisis.

There's reasons no civilized countries are doing these builds, and why big nuclear has hired former big tobacco and big oil lobbyists to sell to authoritarian nations, ones that usually view nuclear as their backdoor entry to weapons development.

So, no, contrary to the turfing that absolutely blankets Reddit, nuclear isn't our friend or our future.  Renewables and conservation are the only viable way forward.  

Because of the GHG crisis, I'd grudgingly support still running existing reactors, because they've already done their enormous carbon release damage during construction.  But I'd disclaim that by saying we need massively better safety and regulation on them.

Don't feel bad.  These are the common lobbyist talking points they turf incessantly, especially to receptive sources like Reddit.

""safe"" - industry propaganda gaslighting, as the world knows nuclear accidents are the most catastrophic.  The fuel itself is unsafe in various ways.

""Clean"" - more industry gaslighting since the waste is incredibly toxic and the opposite of clean, as is the mining.

""Reliable"" - industry BS.  They have frequent shutdowns and safety issues.

Nuclear is just steam based power with a differnt fuel element, there has been nearly 2 billion dollars in funding between Canada and the U.S. to further this tech as well as multiple current plants under construction 

Nuclear is a good middle step between coal and gas into wind/solar. The small reactor projects to me seem the most promising as it’d help diversify the power grid and fuel source’s available 

And sure it’s expensive startup and all, but if the system works and even a portion of the amount of money that gas/wind/solar/coal receive in development money would greatly accelerate how nuclear plays out 

Overall your critiques are very fair but I think between the new emerging tech, the new funding it has received, and the large amount of new orders and construction will be bullish for nuclear

I don’t get the human point since it seems every corporation is run by a corrupt human these days. 

Imo any steps to get away from coal and gas is good even if it’s a slight step it’s still the right direction. Any step to diversify the power grid and fuel sources is a pretty smart bet.

Every build they (oops) have to use unsafe tech because... reasons.  Every reactor still has toxic waste.  The fuel is still dangerous and dirty and expensive to mine and transport and refine and use and dispose of.

The bill of goods they're selling you in 2023 is the same empty promise from 2013, 2003, 1993, 1983, 1973 and and 1963.  It's a ""ok, we know we lied but you can't trust us now"" rope-a-dope.

> every corporation is run by corrupt humans

Yes, but only one industry has 25,000 year consequences when they screw up.  Only one industry leaves whole sectors of countries uninhabitable when it screws up.  

Even big oil, a terrible spill is decades of damage.  Nuclear laughs at such tiny catastrophes.  

We've spent trillions on Chernobyl (with no help from the industry, note) and that's for 2 shields.  We're going to need HUNDREDS of replacement shields.  Where's the nice lobbyists for that?

Japan - supposedly the one of the most tech advanced societies - currently has two active meltdowns they can't stop, or even locate.  

They're using a crazy experimental underground ice fence desperation and praying the meltdown does go through or under the ice fence experiment.  It requires the world's largest refrigeration install to run without interruption... forever.  

They just filled up their toxic waste water tank farm and their secret scheme was to quietly bleed it into the ocean coast.  When they got caught, their new plan is to build a pipe and bleed the toxic waste a little further away from shore.  

The ten year, several hundred million dollar project with their most advanced possible tech to build a robot camera to try and locate the meltdowns?  It's shut down, having conceded failure and having no more ideas.

The test of a good investing method is one that works in regular uneventful years, boom years, and during a recession and a panic. That’s why I was thinking of a 10-20 years, to allow for at least one panic/recession. 

1. I would bet a lot of money that someone holding the Vanguard index fund will outperform anyone who invests with an outlook of 9 months. 

2. Not saying buy any random stock and hold forever. But I think it’s easier and less competition to find a good company that you can hold for 10-20 years that will outperform the market than compete with a million PHDs, AI algorithms, and professionals and hedge funds and bank executives who are all short term outlook era etc to find an outperformed for 9 months. Also if you find that great company, you’ll be happy during recessions and panics because you’ll buy more and more happily at a discount. 

I lost a lot of money when I started out chasing momentum and the next big things. I  made a lot of money when I held long term - and the main reason, I can’t stress this enough - about 75% of all gains over a 10 year period will be because of maybe 5 random days during those 10 years. If you’re short term how will you know when those 5 days are from today until 2033? For example, there were 2 days in March 2020 when entire market was up 10% each day. Imagine what individual companies were up.

>“Automobiles have a long operating life, compared to many other consumer devices,” Thomas Coughlin, Fellow at the Institute for Electronic and Electrical Engineers, told me. “People expect their cars to last for more than 10 years, whereas many five-year-old consumer products are often considered nearly obsolete. Thus, parts for automobiles, including some chips, are often built on older, proven technology, rather than the latest available technology.”

-

>Car companies use a varied selection of chips that tend to be many times larger than what’s employed in most consumer electronics — perhaps as big as 45 or 90 nanometers. These are often used for simple tasks like raising and lowering windows and climate control.

-

>Chipmakers want as much miniaturization as possible to maximize production efficiency, automakers need significant lead time to make sure a chip will work for them.

And I'm not really one to pick a side here. I've been both long and short NVDA in the past year. I don't really know what it's going to do or where it's gonna go.

One thing I can tell you though. AI is legit. Very legit. Honestly, what they've done is wildly, wildly impressive. I honestly think this is something that can become bigger than the internet itself. 

I don't know if NVDA will always be the AI ""king"" as their premium price seems to imply, but they've taken the crown for now.

You can't really think about AI in its utility in terms of the end user either - e.g. just asking silly questions like ""what should we eat for dinner tonight"". 

You need to think more like the head of a major corporation: what can we do with ChatGPT that can streamline our operations, and improve our user experience? Should we invest in the API? Could this be used to automate some of our processes and to cut costs? You need to think of AI as another type of tool (like a spreadsheet except far more powerful) that dramatically simplifies work, substantially increasing productivity.

Right now NVDA has basically taken the AI king crown. It is what big fund managers view as the ""safest"" AI beta along with MSFT. What you're seeing is the effect of Wall Street pricing in what they think AI *could* be capable of doing.

12609,jgyksx0,t1_jgyi5gx,"A very good response 

I'll focus on just pointing out a couple critiques I have though 

First, NVDA is priced today like it'll monopolize all AI for data centers and research. CUDA is very important and mostly monopolized, but there are alternatives and they are quickly developing due to the locked-in nature of NVDA AI and CUDA. There are competitors like AMD, Intel, and Broadcom. Not to mention many Chinese companies which likely will take over the Chinese/Russian market due to sanctions. 

As someone who has worked with LLMs pretty extensively, I see them as one of the clearest practical use cases for AI. There likely will be more applications in the future. 
However, I've also seen LLMs that were cut down extensively to 7 billion parameters, given access to the internet and external memory, and which perform similarly to GPT 3.5 or Bard. 

This means that LLMs will become democratized. Anyone can make their own with a few thousand bucks and a programmer. Furthermore, the larger cutting-edge LLM can be cut down to a smaller size for focused applications. These require much less AI training. 

Cutting-edge research and megafirms and big data centers will need the best LLMs. They will need NVDA gear. But your small companies won't need more than a few weeks with Cloud Access to AI gear to develop their own LLMs. They can then run the cut-down program on an ASIC. 

NVDA deserves its high valuation. I just don't see it expanding that valuation more when it's not truly a monopoly and demand isn't infinite. AI is training AI to become smarter more efficiently.",t3_12rbhs8,1681954492.0,2

If they go up in the future, then they probably weren’t over priced. If they were “over priced” in the past and high now, they either weren’t over priced then or dangerous to buy now",t3_12rbhs8,1681906926.0,-3

I do know that the data pruning/cleaning, training and RLHF efforts can be expensive in terms of compute and/or hours of human time depending on the scope of the AI. Even a smaller AI will still have its costs to implement - especially if you want to implement one with a minimal amount of bias and variance. There's a lot of human work that has to go into LLMs being as effective as they are.

My reply to the OP was less about NVDA and its valuation, and more about what the demand for AI will look like in the future.

Why? Because data centers also started as niche and high cost research oriented business. But they've become ubiquitous and expensive and necessary.

In major corrections there is a fake golden cross before capitulation takes place. These major corrections need the extra optimism before throwing the knock out blow. 

In contrast tho for minor corrections the golden cross passes and is soon retested with a lower low before restarting the new bull trend. Opposite of the major corrections there needs to be that bear bait to help kick start the bull trend. 

So what does this mean for me as to what to expect in the coming days/weeks/months?
 
In early January I went from 95% cash to about %30 cash, loading up on shares for many names. All of those names are currently big green. I’ve hedged those shares with a mixture of long dated SPX/IWM spreads and some protective collars on the shares themselves. 

My goal here is to be positioned for long term moves but with an exit strategy that leaves me green. In sacrificing some of my gains I can “stay in the game” in case I did in fact catch the bottom of all of these names.

The only name that is a big question mark for my  new positions is LCID. I bought LCID at 6.75 a share and there was some kind of meme pump Friday. Had to roll my covered calls out and my puts up but since I wanted these shares long term I’m not sure what to do here. I know how to navigate most situations now but never had this issue before.

Honestly, ignore the noise. Trade the price action. All of this debate about interest rates here is pointless. We could talk about random indicators that correlate prices, commodities, inflation cycles, lagging and leading effects blah blah - but honestly, you could be right and still be wrong about how the market reacts.

Nope- the charts were screaming we were going to rocket but permabears keep shorting; just like it says now we are going to correct back down.

Additionally, and this is purely hypothetical from my end, the Fed can also pause rates but accelerate QT in an attempt to flatten the yield curve a bit in a bid to control longer term rates, which are currently relatively low compared to even three months ago.

12767,j6b5s8c,t1_j6apsa5,"we're annualizing the 3-month core inflation at just under 4%. This is NOT ""not too far off 2%"". This is actually quite a way off, specifically almost overshooting by 100%.

To make it clear, every economist and even the Fed in 2022 knew getting inflation down from 9% to 4% would be the easy part. All of that portion of inflation is transitory, such as supply chain recovery, cooling demand for core goods, cooling car prices from higher interest rate and no more chip shortage. The sticky part of inflation is actually the job market, and that takes A LOT longer to go down, and usually involves AT LEAST some pain. This part will determine where inflation will ultimately stall out at.

So focusing on the job market, the data in the job market is not showing signs of cooling. Initial jobless claims need to go to at least 300k, but it reversed upward trend and got down below 200k twice. Nonfarm payroll needs to go down to under 100k, but it stalled at above 200k and are going up again. job opening to available worker ratio needs to go down to low 1, but it's still stalling out at 1.7. Wage inflation needs to go down to 3.5% annualized, but it's somewhere between 4.5-5%.

So can inflation go down to 2% without a recession? Sure it's possible. Is it likely? No. The pathway for it, stated by Fed Brainard multiple times in interview, is if businesses start to cut down on their profit margins to attract customers, allowing product prices to go down even with elevated input prices like labor. This way, no one gets laid off, and prices go down. Unlikely scenario that businesses will do that, but even if they do, does that sound like a positive environment for stocks where profit margins is rapidly going down?",t3_10njobs,1674957492.0,3

How about we take the 3-month over 3-month estimates, then annualize them (multiply by 4). [Then we get this](https://i.imgur.com/7SadD14.png). Nick Timiraos on Twitter notes that the latest 3 month average saw:

- Core goods: -4.8%
- Shelter: +9.2% (again very laggy--note that headline CPI includes shelter, though, and is still coming down)
- Services less shelter: +1.2%

You only started investing since 2009? Must be why you have no clue about DCF valuation, maybe because you don't need to understand valuation.

What's a ""big enough discount rate"" to you? I'd like to know. And what's your ""margin of safety"". The 10 year rate can vary widely depending on the trajectory of inflation. The equity risk premium will also go up if inflation is higher. The disparity is so large it can make Sp500 fair value between 2800 to 4500. Go ahead and put your ""margin of safety"" onto that.

There are people who point at NVDA's 130 PE.

But when that 130 PE came from 2022 which included the following: 2.17bn inventory charges, china chip ban, 1.35bn arm termination fee, change to proof of stake destroying crypto mining (NVDA's 'gaming' revenue which was cut in half), worldwide poor macro conditions (rate hikes + inflation) leading to companies and consumers cutting spending where possible, gaming GPU is one of the first to be cut in the personal budget

I'm sure I could be forgetting a few things but I would not use 2022 as an indicator of the future given the above are either one-off events (termination fees and write downs which added back brings NVDA's PE to 70) or factors outside of NVDA's control (chip ban and interest hikes)

Their recent massive rally can be justified depending on whether the AI boom will fuel NVDA sales in the long term which is highly speculative.

There's also the scenario that AI does take off, but their large customers develop their own chips. 

'Gaming' alone will never justify their market cap, that's why they're chasing the corporate money.

The reason I've personally been holding for a long time is:

1. One of the very few if not the only mega tech company still run by the founder who is also an engineer. MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META and GOOGL all became massive in their fields under the leadership of their founders.

2. History shows that while there are failures, the investors who hit  at home-run 100x bagger are the ones who held AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA when their futures were NOT certain and the valuations were NOT 10-20 PE. AMZN was always (still is) unprofitable or trading at insane PE ratios, yet that didn't stop them from being a great investment. When TSLA when burning cash and their survival was in question, that was the time where an investor hit it 100x. AAPL once had triple digit PE before the massive iPhone profits came in. MSFT was before my time but who invested in the 80s or early 90s when a PC in every home was NOT the norm, nor was it inevitable it would be the norm.

3. While it paid for earlier NVDA investors, and some think it's too late (it may be too late) I remember people thinking AAPL half a trillion market cap was too late. People who invested when AAPL was the biggest company in the world a decade ago were rewarded with 1000%+ return when including dividends.

There is speculative upside and downside, always will be, but I think long term investors ought to be optimists just seeing how companies continue to surprise in how much innovation (and profits) they can deliver.

Hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta do *not* like being held hostage by a hardware or software platform. It's why Amazon designed the now very successful Graviton CPUs back when it was 100% dependent on Intel.

As regards your second point, citing Tesla and Apple in particular as historical standards for a 100x bagger, one distinction you didn’t mention was that these two companies offered products which were - in some notable ways - very different from the product NVDA offers.  

I’m curious if you disagree with what I’m about to write and see your reasoning behind the disagreement.  And for whatever it’s worth, I currently see NVDA’s fair value, given all the macro factors currently at work, as closer to 180, and I do hold a position to that effect.  

So here’s my distinction - Apple and Tesla offered tech solutions in a complete format.  That is, you bought an iPhone or you bought an electric car by that Musk guy, and you were set.  While AI is arguably a massive market in the future, NVDA’s customer won’t *directly* be the consumer the way that Tesla and Apple ultimately were.  I will say that NVDA *was* a direct solution for consumers with crypto mining, but as you astutely pointed out, that ship has largely sailed.

12952,jbbdt8h,t1_jba7bd2,"> Apple and Tesla offered tech solutions in a complete format. That is, you bought an iPhone or you bought an electric car by that Musk guy, and you were set.

Vertical integration can unlock a lot of potential for margin expansion. Sure an iPhone or Tesla 3 are competitive in hardware at the very least, but they're popular because people are buying into the whole solution. Your friends use Facetime and the Supercharger network is better, so an iPhone or a Tesla is more valuable to the consumer. Nvidia is doing similar with their software ecosystem and I think they will have more success. Their CEO is always hawking about how the cost of whatever their new product is almost irrelevant because of the amount of money that can be made or saved right now with their integrated solution.

The counterpoint is that there are limits to how high this will scale. There are a dozen tech companies in the world with the scale and resources to build a competing product to Nvidia at lower total cost for their uses. A few have already done it, and the number will grow as investment in AI processors ramps up. Same reasons Apple developed A series CPUs and finally M series for laptops/desktops, Amazon developed Graviton server CPUs. Meta and Microsoft may be happy to pay Nvidia a few billion per year on hardware right now, but don't think they will be happy to continue paying 70% margins when that investment increases by a factor of 10 or 100 over the years. They can and will build in house if the open market solutions do not drive down prices low enough.

Large enterprises like banks or healthcare might be happy to spend many millions or a few billion per year with Nvidia for a complete solution, because that is outside their core business.

At the end of the day, Nvidia didn't invent math and they can't maintain a monopoly over a field when so many companies will be spending so much into it.",t3_11kyoue,1678222034.0,6

I get it though, I feel the same way about our public schools down here. That’s one of the main reasons we homeschool.

Not because of political or religious differences, but to keep our boys ahead of their class instead of letting them lose interest in learning simply because they have to wait on the rest of their peers to catch up.

That, and we can take spontaneous trips throughout the year and introduce our kids to other parts of the US. We got to watch baseball games at Bucknell, Columbia, Tufts, and Harvard this year and walk around their campuses.",t3_142c5u0,1686086184.0,2

With my wife being a public school teacher we want them to be in public schools when they reach that age. Home schooling would put us at one income which would put us behind financially. Though we do pay way too much for daycare now.

My wife has a doctorate of education so it’s not worth putting her career on hold. Also taking care of children everyday is exhausting which neither of us want to do.

Things are definitely more costly here. But we do plan on taking them around as they get older.

We’re also big on walking everywhere and public transportation. If I never had to drive to get around again that would be amazing. Our house is within walking distance of the train and our downtown. And if we do go on a trip we are close enough that an Uber or public transportation is an option.

13126,jn6eepd,t1_jn6bagy,"Understandable. Although the radical side of course gets the most attention and spotlight. The majority of Texans hate what’s presented on the ballot.

We’re very fortunate in how we get to homeschool. My wife and her dad manufacture a bioremediation product and private label it to another company, so she gets to earn and not have to be there for set hours. We also own a good chunk of equity in the company we private label to, so hopefully we see continued growth in that.

Mine only holds a Bachelor of Science, but is on the fence on whether she should get her Master’s or not. It’d be more of a personal goal as opposed to for career growth. Circling back to what we talked about earlier, your wife would walk into most districts and walk out the Superintendent in Texas.

Public transportation is the one thing that I do envy about a lot of cities on the east coast. Cars are an absolute necessity here because of how spaced out we are. I’d love to be able to ride a bus, subway, or train and get a lot of my editing and writing done. Maybe I’ll get that luxury when I retire in a few years.

The pay vs the COL is why I only have to work until 40, and why we’ll get to live where we want then, not where we have to then.",t3_142c5u0,1686088888.0,2

It could do fine, but it's hard to see how it would be a huge relative winner from here. You'd probably need to be betting on the macro (in which case why NVDA?) or the AI hype accelerating further.

Otherwise there seems to be a lot of down side risk near-term. Demand obviously isn't great right now. and it's not clear how long that will last, the AI hype might be overplayed near-term, and the valuation is currently stretched.

Long-term I worry more about competition. Investors pay a premium for NVDA because of its dominant position in AI, and while I'm not going to claim I'm an expert in this space, from what I've read there's a reason to think others like AMD and maybe INTC could erode their marketshare with time. Believers will tell you, ""it will never happen!"", but it's amazing how much disruption and change can in a decade in tech.

My personal view is sell, take the gain and look for an attractive reentry price. I think NVDA is going to be volatile with large swings up and down, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price is only slightly higher than it is today in 5 years.",t3_113or5x,1676572541.0,1

All this AI hype has people thinking it’s going to explode, but it’s oversold. The Cloud boom was driving a lot of that, especially from the heavy hitters like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Their cloud growth is slowing down, and those companies already have a shit ton of GPU capacity. Frankly AMD (with their Xilinx acquisition) could end up being positioned better than Nvidia for AI workloads. You’re almost assuredly going to see an AMD FPGA integrated directly into a 2nm CPU die, directly into a GPU die, or perhaps a dedicated AI system build, with multiple low nm FPGA’s on the motherboard along with multiple GPUs. FPGA’s are also very futureproof, as by definition they are reprogrammable. At some point it’s conceivable that ML model structure will shift, such that GPU’s become significantly slower than FPGA’s or ASIC’s due to design efficiencies gained by directly constructing circuits to run or train specific ML architectures.

Crypto continuing to move to proof of stake will continue to shrink that market segment also.

Also, their consumer GPU’s could already hit 90fps at 4K on the previous generation (3xxx series), so there is very little need to upgrade to a 4xxx.

Too many uncertainties (for me) to justify a ~600B valuation, on what’s looking like a ~$4bn profit year in 2023.

AMD guided for double digit negative growth in data center next quarter and withdrew their full year guidance. I highly doubt that NVDA can get away with that after this run. There was FOMC the next day anyways that propelled AMD to that huge pop

One reason to use Nvidia products over ASIC for AI is that Nvidia GPUs are widely deployed and supported by a large ecosystem of software solutions12. Nvidia GPUs also offer high performance and flexibility for different AI tasks, such as training and inference2.

Another reason to use Nvidia products over ASIC for AI is that ASICs are more specialized and optimized for specific AI tasks, such as Google’s TPU for machine learning models3. This means that ASICs may not be compatible or efficient for other AI tasks or applications, and may require more customization and integration4.

A third reason to use Nvidia products over ASIC for AI is that Nvidia is constantly innovating and improving its AI chips, such as the Ampere AI chip that was announced in 20205.

I personally don't see incumbents shifting away from ASIC or Nvidia's offerings in the self driving market. *Mobileye's approach essentially locks into place their current technology attack and associated self-driving algorithms, while NVIDIA leaves the door open to more flexible approaches.* I just don't see how being less flexible is in any way enticing.

13299,ikvbwff,t1_ikud257,"Yes, miners do pull back and it's a side gig not a business for some. I can't remember the name for it but recently miners were selling over 100% of their output ie assets they had saved on top of their production when it's normally 20-40%. I believe it's typical for a lot of miners to sell to cover their costs and either retain the rest (why wouldn't you in a bull market) or sell various amounts but we ain't in a bull market.

If you go look at https://whattomine.com/
You can figure out any profits based on energy prices. 

As someone who bought a gpu for general use and used it in downtime to mine ie I am the smallest miner I can give you my thoughts. I've had to stop mining due to asset price drop along with energy cost raise it means I'd actually be losing money if I was mining. So if you expand that to a farm of 10 say, you've got ten GPUs sitting around turned off, do you want to buy another? No. You might decide to get out the game for a while, sell up what you have left and jump back in when it's profitable again. If that's 2 years from now you might be doubling your production for an extra 30% in cost and no effort.

The other side to that coin is huuuge miners that pay nothing or next to nothing for their energy can afford to run them regardless, they might want more but where the percentages of how much it the market they make up I don't know, it would be very difficult to tell there's no obvious accounts to go into. Their ROI is going to be shooting up as the prices drop so risk tolerance may vary.

He also reveals he doesn't know how to do a backup and rollback to undo a predictably risky hardware installlation.

He spends most of his time whining about UI window issues and Arc Control installation. But the things he says don't work would be a shitstorm if they were widespread. But that's not what's happening. So I'm not sure what this dude's actual issue is.

He complains about video artifacts in DX11 and DX9 when certain smoothing features are enabled. Intel admits that the cards work less than perfectly with older versions of DirectX.

If China takes action against Taiwan, are these companies nimble enough to uproot fabrication and setup elsewhere?

13585,jl8v0pz,t1_jl8t3mz,"A few things.

1) GPU sales have been down pretty significantly over the past 6 months.

2) Recession fears are still with us. Individuals and companies alike have been cutting costs where they can.

3) Nvidia supplies most of their chips to several industries outside gaming that are also reporting slowing growth: automotive and robotics being the main ones.

4) Guidance last quarter was not great. Now we get to see if they were right.

5) Hype generally creates a scenario of ""sell the news"". Everyone is aware that the AI hype caused an enormous jump in share price, and that's highly unlikely to be reflected in higher revenue in the short term.

There are other reasons but these are the main ones. I'm also a big believer that each technology has a limit. How we get to the next level is by adapting an implementing a new technology or new variation of an older one. Moore's Law is still validated at the moment, but I think we are coming very close to a point where it breaks. Even something as small as atoms doubling every two years would eventually fill a limited space. It's illogical to assume that Moore's Law won't be broken, the question is when. But from industry leaders, it's being reported that they're starting to see the end here. It's getting more difficult by the day and the people who were saying Moore's Law would go on forever eventually began saying maybe 10 more years, and now are saying perhaps 5.

The new technology that can come in and save the day looks to be chiplets. Unfortunately, Nvidia dropped the ball there and are kind of catching up now. AMD got on the chiplet train a little earlier, and they do have a lead in that one area.

Why is that important? In the long term, I think restructuring of manufacturing chips is going to be an enormous disruptor. In the short term it means allocating more capital to developing a newer technology. That's very cost intensive and could affect the bottom line of semiconductor companies over the next few years.

It's all a guess of course. But there is too much negative with Nvidia itself right now to ignore. That's without touching on the macro environment which, despite what people are signalling, is not great.",t3_13p1y87,1684811947.0,14

1.  You are correct.  However the company forecast coming out of that down cycle by the end of last year, 2022.  It's now Q1 they're reporting.   The big indicator here was the GM forcast was moving from low 60s to mid to high 60%.
2.  The ""engine"" driving nvidia growth is not gaming, it's data center, specifically computation for AI training.  The biggest customers do not have enough of the latest GPUs.   Sam Altman (CEO Open AI) testified in to the US Congress last week he ""can't get enough GPUs.""
3. You don't mention Data Center, their biggest segment.   It should come in between $4.5B-$5B in revenue this quarter.  The biggest customers are Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google, Facebook, Google.  These guys are slowing down orders to Intel, not to Nvidia.  Automotive is rising, but not significant, it will turn in \~5-7% of revenue of data center.
4. Guidance last quarter increased 8% q/q to $6.5B.   Please explain what was ""not great"" about that.
5. Hype is a difficult issue to quantify because it is subjective.    Indications are their data center GPUs are sold out through the end of the year.   

Not sure what you think you know about chiplets, but NVIDIA VP GPU Engineering Jonah Alben says that monolithic chips are best if your company can build them and that's why he's sticking with them.  I'd believe him over what AMD thinks simply because AMD aren't winning anything right now in GPU.  In fact, their market share continues to shrink.

13600,jlap54u,t1_jl9dvpm,">GPU sales went down, 

Yes they did.  Now GPU sales are recovering after a bubble in crypto mining.  

>competition (alternative accelerators Google, Amazon, AMD and Celebrate) are gaining traction, 

Not true.  Goog Amazon produce for internal use only, don't sell on the merchant market, but still buy TONS of GPUs from Nvidia.  AMD market share nearly isn't measureable in data center and Celebrus is an R&D project, not a viable competitor.

&#x200B;

>Nvidia is not producing GPUs but designing them so the big profit has the actual manifacturer, 

Not true.  TSMC gross margins are less than Nvidia's.  TSMC cap ex is enormous where Nvidia's is tiny for a company of it's size.

&#x200B;

2) I can't see how recent AI hype could be reflected in this quarter, a point I already made. It takes time to ramp up productions to meet new demand.

3) I don't mention data centers because I know that segment is likely to be strong. It doesn't take enormous slowing across the board to make a dent in the stock price. If they are simultaneously recording slowdowns across multiple sectors, in addition to an increase in data centers, does this warrant a tripling of the share price in a matter of months?

4) 8% is a significant drop from past guidance. It's also a lofty goal. A PE of 150 typically demands more than 8% Q/Q growth.

5) Again, does this justify such an enormous share price increase? You seem to be looking at price action possibilities through a lens that does not put significant enough emphasis on the fact their share price has tripled recently. That puts a lot of strain on expectations.

Regardless whether chiplets are a solution or not, Nvidia is actually investing heavily there. If they were certain there'd be no significant need for them, they wouldn't be trying to compete there. That competition requires a lot of capital, which they are deploying now. If anything the argument that chiplets aren't so necessary only bolsters my point, because it indicates that Nvidia is spending a lot of capital on a technological change that won't bear much fruit for them.

We clearly disagree a bit here. That's okay. However so far I'm the only one to admit that this is a guess, only an opinion, and anything could happen.

Absolutely I could be wrong.   And I'd be stunned if they whiffed earnings.  It wouldn't be the first time, either.   But in fact the way this stock normally responds to ""good"" earnings is flat or down for a day or two after earnings, and then it solidifies and rises.

(Source: companiesmarketcap.com).  That sounds like a classic sky-high overvaluation bubble to me.

Perhaps it is, I'm willing to concede the point.   But these are more valuation arguments.  My comment on valuation is Nvidia has been ""expensive"" by traditional metrics since 2016.   Here we are 7 years later and it's still expensive.   I didn't bid the price up.  Did you?   No the market did.  What would cause the market to hold a security up for so long on such little earnings?   That is an interesting question.   Then of course, the market is always about the future as you point out.   Why does Mr. Market think this stock is worth a ridiculous 28X sales or whatever it is at the moment?

>Sure, the COMPANY may be entering a growth cycle, but the STOCK PRICE (making it the the #6 most valuable company already) might as well already be jumping years ahead of itself by pricing in its terminal value 10 years from now (assuming everything goes right for Nvidia, and nothing goes wrong -- no margin of safety). 

Well, I'm not advocating buying anywhere.   Are you advocating selling?

> What more do you want out of the stock price at this point 

Revenue and Earnings Growth.   Wall street rewards growth.  That's the only reason I'm here.

I appreciate the crowd that wants to sit back and do their DCF analysis.  They would be more comfortable in SCHD or VOO than they would in NVDA.   That's why I don't know why folks with that sort of outlook even bother looking at a company like Nvidia.  Or putting in thoughtful effort to make a post like the one you did.

What is interesting to me about the where Nvidia is going is they have an interesting technology platform that is opening new markets, brand new markets that are really unquantified at this point.   Interestingly competition can't seem to get traction in their space, overcome their moat.   Its certainly one of the riskiest stocks on the planet.   But it's also one of the most well run, most strategic, best managed companies I've ever seen.    Sure they've made mistakes too, it's all a part of learning.

I was buying as much NVDA as I could last october when everyone in the world thought Nvidia was going tits up, just like I was selling in November 21.   I've been through 4 or 5 gyrations of boom and bust with this company.   I hope I can see it a little more clearly now.   I mean the stock has made me/friends/family a shit ton of money.  But it's not for the faint of heart either, it's a major roller coaster.  Takes a strong constitution (just look at the abuse in this sub).

All I can say after 15 years of owning the stock is it's on the way to making new ATHs.   Maybe not immediately, but certainly before EOY.   Just here for the ride.",t3_13p1y87,1684894552.0,2

13624,jle80ve,t1_jldsnwt,"Tell me if I have this right... take this scenario, if I sell an ITM covered call for $2000 It gets deposited into my account.... say a strike price of $305 expiration in 3 days... if price of the stock stays under $305 call expires worthless, I keep the $2000 premium. If say it expires but stock is at $310. I will sell the 100 shares for $30500 when really I could have just sold it for $31000. So technically I missed on $500 if it goes to $310 however, if it expires worthless I made 400% more in this specific example. So selling the covered call, the lower the price goes under strike price is where I will make the money. if it goes higher, I will just not have made as much but regardless I will lock in $30500 from the sale.

13628,jldyhw5,t1_jldi2gg,"Perhaps you weren't arguing about valuation per se.  Valuation is something I tend to bring up sometimes even if it's not part of the original discussion/argument.  Why is that?  Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion since this subreddit is r/stocks and not r/technology, it should be implied without saying that the primary purpose of all discussion here should circle back to the one action question we care about: ""Do I want to buy, hold, sell, short, or avoid this stock at its current price?""  And I think valuation is always something that should be considered when trying to answer that question, while also being aware that valuations can get out of whack on either direction at times.

For NVDA, I do think the valuation has gotten out of whack to the upside - like, very out of whack.  You could say it's been ""expensive"" by traditional metrics since 2016, yes, but now it is *particularly* expensive - [the most expensive price-to-sales ratio it has ever had in history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales) \- and in a rising interest rate environment.   I like to keep it simple and use price-to-sales ratio as a metric when making a bearish argument (as opposed to P/E ratio that others use), because (1) it is generally less lumpy and prone to accounting distortions than P/E ratio, and (2) it allows for more generous assumptions to argue against (i.e. - looking at top-line revenue with an ""even if we assume that expenses are minimal and profit margins are great, it is still very expensive"" lens to make a bear case).

And this may be a dumb hot take here, but I don't think *any* MEGA-CAP company trading at over 20x P/S ratio (such as Nvidia) should be owned as a ""long term investment"" ever ever ever.  A 20x+ P/S ratio stock (NVDA being nearly 30x) requires too many damn positive assumptions about growth just to hope to break even on your investment years later.  I don't care how great the company is.  I don't care if the stock price has performed well in the past.  I don't care if you've owned the stock for years.  See, for example, how amazingly well Intel and Cisco stocks performed from 1990-2000, and starting in year 2000 when they reached the status of mega-cap companies trading at high P/S ratios (similar to Nvidia today), they've had piss-poor performance ever since because valuations got out of whack in 2000.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Nothing I say here matters.  Because in the mean-time, NVDA stock will probably moon after the earnings report anyways.",t3_13p1y87,1684903175.0,1
13629,jlea407,t1_jle80ve,"You will lock in 30500 + 2000.  So 32500 for the trade.  The ITM call is a way to hedge the position and accept a set return going into earnings.  It does cap your upside.  Your max profit is just below 305.  And you start to lose money at 30500-2000= 28500. Your profit is greater than the market as long as NVDA stays below 32500.

The advantage of selling the call as opposed to buying the put is you sell the IV instead of Buying it.  The downside is you cap your upside at 32500.  But you can always wheel the position and roll the call out or sell a cash secured put at 32500 or wherever you feel comfortable redeploying your capital.

These numbers are rarely sited on financial news and unless you are insider adjacent you will never be able to separate them from rumors. But as you get closer to the earnings date a public consensus does emerge that usually is somewhere in the middle of all these relevant numbers, but when there is a huge price change around earnings it is almost always because too much of the big money’s whisper numbers (expected quarterly earnings and updated guidance) were off and so the price changes to reflect new information

Well, I disagree with that.  Sometimes you want to take a risk.  When I was buying at 40% of the current sh price, Nvidia was $280B MC, still a mega cap.   Obviously one wants to mitigate that risk as much as possible, but it boils down to understanding and risk tolerance.    I feel as good about holding here as I did in October, generative AI has become larger than life.  While the signs are bright, next Q doesn't have to be a monster,  the growth will be there in time, no question.

However, going all in on one isn’t something I would do plus I think you’re glancing over some important aspects about the semi industry.

ASML makes the lithography machines that make this all possible and they are a MONOPOLY. Little expensive at the moment but is just a few P/E away from being reasonable. 

TSM sans “political risk” makes up a good chunk of the “foundry” portion of semis. It’s also fairly undervalued imo.

QCOM is heavily into phone chips but also has other revenue streams like IT/ other Telecom. Glancing at some financials they seem to be doing well but their previous years personally bug me.

NVDA is pivoting to more AI and Data, and simulation tools which will “work best” with their hardware. It’s unfortunately probably going to drop more 

AMD  will be all about maintaining that 10-20% yoy growth which im guessing they’ll be able to do once we are out of this inflation. They are also the only real competitor to NVDA in their niches.

INTC has been given so much gov support and yet they are shrinking their workforce. I fear big blue won’t be around for too much longer.

MU is on the memory/data side. Their financials are a roller coaster. Surprised no one tried to sell you on this one because it was such a hot stock at one point. I’d avoid 

Looked a bit into the following since I didn’t know a ton about them:

TXN basically makes chips for more “industrial” uses though it seems a bit expensive at the moment 

AVGO focuses on IT/Telecom . You aren’t getting a bargain here but good lord they seem strong at first glance

They do have a monopoly on EUV lithography for the foreseeable future and higher energy costs in the EU won't necessarily impact their business. $INTC is kind of a pig, but it's cheap. You can put lipstick on a pig though. I started adding here and there when it went below $25 but i'm not convinced it's a solid investment so stop losses are set properly. But its valuation is cheap so if you think it has a chance to recover, it might be worth it. I see it in the $50s in 4, 5 years, assuming nuclear armageddon doesn't arrive first. If things seem to be going that way, i would advise you to invest in uranium and iodine stocks.

Edit: $TSM is a mamoth of a well ran business with spectacular technology. Do some due dilligence on $TSM even if you don't plan on investing in it since by doing so you get a better picture of the sector and how the fabless businesses orbit $TSM. 2nd edit: optical transducers, nanophotonics are important. $IIVI acquired $COHR recently, acquisition went through and they're just $COHR now. Pay attention to some private businesses that might at some point go public. Jim Keller, the CPU architect/designer is working on a AI startup for some time now. The guy is a undisputable genious.

I have a position in AMD, but I’ve been trading around NVDA. Unfortunately, the IV with both NVDA and AMD are multiplying the moves in prices intraday, but it will present opportunities in a few weeks when they report. AMD already pre-reported a $1B shortfall in rev. on what was already lowered expectations. If NVDA holds up better in comparison we might see a bottom in the semis, and by extension the $SOX and possibly the NASDAQ as well. So much sentiment is being attached to tech, data service/AI, and semis in general for their potential to continue growing market share even through the downturn, so if they start to perform well I can see sentiment turning around regardless of interest rates, dollar, etc.

Caveat to the OP: It depends entirely on how their earnings perform in the next few weeks as to how optimism holds out for earnings to hold up through the cycle. For those who are saying the August rally never made sense, it was due in part to tech earnings being “not as bad” as feared.

As mentioned, TXN has a good balance sheet but enjoys a premium because of it, and ASML has a solid monopoly in the litho market since they make the equipment that make the semiconductors, which takes years to research, develop and produce.

I think any one of these companies will be very valuable in 10 years, but depending on the severity of the economic slowdown, the stock price may not reflect that longer term value for some time to come.

Also, a risk to investing in these companies is that this long term view is a consensus opinion among many investors, so if that valuation starts to really deteriorate in a material way (for whatever reason), there could potentially be a lot of people headed for the exits at the same time.",t3_y4donq,1665856114.0,2

3. Poor capital allocation.

My thesis is that hurdles 1 and 2 will dissipate with 5G, IoT, wearable medical devices, electrification, and EVs. NVEC produces sensors that send more bits per second, bits per watt, bits per sensor size, and bits per dollar than anything else on the market. Going long on the stock is a bet that, eventually, that will matter. IoT and wearable devices in particular.

3 is my concern. I hate their dividend and want them to spend the money courting manufacturers. They've been talking about their TAM in earnings reports for 10 years without growth to show. It's nice that they're shareholder friendly but I want the company to spend the money to accelerate growth.

So I'll hold the stock for 4 or 5 years, collect 8.3% yield, and look for growth or progress. If they can't grow then I'll sell into strength and find something else. If they do grow... it's a 10x at least. Heads I win, tails I don't lose much.",t3_y4donq,1665846906.0,1

If we can keep the boat of western democracy afloat and climate change doesn't cause to much of a crisis, in time reshoring will gradually happen as wages and standards of living reach some sort of equilibrium across the globe.

Same for Intel. They were untouchable in the early Core era. Now they're in the shit. But the situations could easily flip. CPUs are designed years in advance, so correcting a bad course can be long and costly.

NVDA have barely put a foot wrong for a long time now, so I'd agree they seem pretty safe in that sense, the problem is the stock valuation is now so high, it's already priced in years of continued excellence.

In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about ""what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?"" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all.",t3_vpiex5,1656785803.0,7

You said you want to reduce risk, yet you add more allocation to technology companies - which has been the winners of the last decade. Most of the time, the winner of the last decade are not the winners of the next one, and by removing sectors you are taking away diversification and thus risk. 

For example Financials do better than during high interest rates as they can offer better spreads to their customer (the difference between the fed interest rate and what they offer the customers). In contrast technology does worse, as their ability to generate loses declines. In high interest rate environments, the hurdle rate for investment increases -  so people are less likely to own companies that start to make money in 10 years. 

Real Estate protects against inflation better than tech for examples.

Would you not agree that an investor who goes from 100% US to 50% US and 50% emerging markets is both more diversified and also much riskier of a portfolio? (Extreme example, but just illustrating the point)

Also, China is near to the biggest economy of the world and its share of VT is like 3%. It's GDP multiplied 18 fold from 1997 to today while its stock market (well, Hong Kong's Hang Seng) this year returned to 1997 levels.

again not that any of these ideas are bad plays.  i am viewing this as a risk adjusted approach.  nothing worse than accidentally adding risk where you intend to take it off.

14370,is07qhw,t3_y1man3,"I think they could be attractive but what worries me is that the risk profile of companies like TSM, AMD and NVDA have now completely changed.

Now the US is putting restrictions on US chip exports to China we could see China getting more proactive in securing their claim to Taiwan in a move to gain some leverage against US sanctions. The more the US tries to restrict tech and semi exports to China the less China has to loose taking actions like blockading Taiwan.

Realistically this status-quo will not hold and something is going to happen over the next decade, that's unlikely to be a full invasion in my opinion, but China can still apply extreme pressure on Taiwan if it's in the interest of their national security. And make no mistake, securing access to cutting-edge semis is absolutely essential to the national security of both the US and China.

What worries me about buying any of these companies is that that there are now significant geopolitically tail risks here in which these companies could drop significantly more overnight. Plus arguably semi stocks like AMD, NVDA and TSM are all extremely expensive relative to the rest of the market already. The risk/reward seems skewed towards very positive returns (assuming the status-quo holds), or extremely negative (assuming geopolitically tensions increase).

Lol. It's definitely not this easy for multiple reasons. The main one being that even if you assume everyone working at TSMC is happy to relocate their families to the US it  would still take years to build a comparable manufacturing plant in the US. I'm not saying their aren't solutions here, I'm just saying that at any moment you risk a crisis that will send semis down 20-30% over night and it could take years before they're able to recover.

>I also see the China export ban as a good thing. The products we're making are so powerful that we can't risk an adversary getting them.

You're basically just agreeing with what I'm saying. In the same way the US can't risk China getting them, China can't risk the US having a monopoly on them. This is why the risk is so high - China will probably have to act in one way or another. My guess is that easiest option near-term will be to disrupt TSMC's ability to create chips for the US companies. They can do this fairly easily with blockades.

Nvidia has been extremely tone-deaf to consumers recently, prices and power draw have been increasing at insane rates for major performance gains despite customers asking for more efficient and cheaper cards that only get slight performance gains. They also recently released a GPU that's more expensive than their own GPU which has been out for years now that was faster. Would of been ok a few months ago when prices were insane but they released it just a few weeks ago when it's price-performance made 0 sense. Both companies have the potential to be great but at least in the consumer market Intel is the only one innovating right now at least compared to Nvidia.

With Intel being the one innovating, has the dividend, longer experience in the field, often considered higher skilled engineers, and recent expansions. Intel seems like it's the better long term option, especially if you compound the dividends, Nvidia may get some good growth in the next few years especially with their new GPUs in a few months hopefully. Current leaks for pricing are ridiculously high so unless they drop the price (which they probably will) they won't sell. But if they're reasonably priced it will be great for Nvidia if their performance leaks are semi-accurate. Intel on the other hand has room to grow for years with no sign of slowing with recent innovations and strong competition with AMD. Their entrance into the GPU market with some driver work (which is likely) may also be extremely profitable in a generation or two.

I like GTLB & FROG for DevOps exposure outside of the megas. GTLB probably has more upside, and Google backing, but FROG probably the safer/better run company right now IMO.

These are the negatives that will create an opportunity to buy on declines.($120 to $150)

1)The lack of Ethereum mining pounds GPU's used for mining - **that market is gone.**

2) A crypto winter ensures used GPU cards being returned to the market and sinking ASP's.

3) Gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear.

As a result, NVDA's FY Jan 2023 EPS will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over FY 2022.

Looking forward is key to buying this company on declines and owning this stock for the next 3-5 years.

Data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022. 

My estimate for data center for FY Jan 2023 is 16,300 growing 53% YoY and about 7,800 for gaming, a drop of 38%. 

My revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**EPS**|**5.00**|**43%**|**6.50**|**30%**|

NVDA's FY Jan 2023 EPS will be closer to $3.5! Terrible! but Crypto did earn them a lot when the going was good..no point crying about a market that's disappeared.

More importantly, I expect $NVDA to earn $5 per share in FY Jan 24 and $6.5 in FY Jan 2025. 

I'll start accumulating in 20% increments below $150; given current market conditions after Powell's hawkish speech, the stock could tank to $120.

14720,ion2nap,t3_xeelj7,"First off Ethereum mining is finished so everybody who bought GPU(s) or ASICs to mine are in a dilemma whether they should sell their hardware or look for another coin which can be mined profitable.

Imagine regular gamers buying multiple graphics cards (sometimes dozens) just to mine because they heard it it's profitable, and this was from 2020 until now. And imagine big mining farms where you can find hundreds or even thousands of graphics cards, this was from \~2017. You can google it, just take a look at some of those pictures.

About 95% of the mining-power (hashrate) was mining Ethereum so all the other GPU-minable coins combined can't ""absorb"" all of this calculation-capacity so these other coins became unprofitable overnight for most of these people (unless they have very-very cheap or free electricity).

So back to the article it's not just this mining pool but about 80+% of all miners (based on calculations) will probably look to sell their hardware on the second hand market in the coming weeks/months and all this worth about between $5B and $15B, it depends on who you ask, it's between 10 and 30 million graphics cards.

Also Nvidia inventory is full of new RTX 30xx cards right now that's why they choose to introduce in October only the high-end RTX 40xx cards first because they're much faster than the fastest 30xx card the 3090 Ti so they don't have in-house competition.

The prices of second hand market will push down the new market prices because that's how supply and demand works, if I buy a used card because it's really cheap then I'm no longer looking for a new card. So I'm pretty sure their gaming revenue and margin will go even lower in this year.

I'm not sure how this will affect the stock price because in one hand the Ethereum Merge is very old news, whoever is serious about looking after their investment should've known about this for months. On the other hand Jensen Huang always downplayed the effect of mining on the company.

They expect the revenue to drop to $5.9B in Q3 (down from $6.7B in Q2), they told us that their inventory levels are high so this is already priced in. But they didn't mention anything about the second hand market after the Ethereum Merge in their earnings call.

The way they tested was fundamentally flawed, however. They arbitrarily narrowed the definition of Active Driver Assist software to Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keep Assist, meaning, the only driving functionalities that the organization tested were the ability to speed up and slow down on highways and the ability to keep the vehicle inside the lane similarly on highways. Meaning FSD’s ability to take unprotected left turns, deal with roundabouts, etc were not included which no other ADAS system can do. Also they equal weighted the time a driver can take their hands off the wheel with how the system recognizes its environment and responds.

Other systems like Waymo and cruise use expensive LIDAR set ups and are only capable of navigating in one or 2 cities at this point and they can’t use the highways. 

Others such as Mercedes which got permission for level 3 self driving can only do so in very specific conditions in geofenced areas. There has to be car in front of you that it can follow, it can’t go over 50 mph, can only be done on certain stretches of highway, etc.

Tesla has developed a system that can be dropped anywhere and will attempt to drive. Their tech is infinitely scalable compared to the competition because it is cheap (about $2000 of hardware per car) and doesn’t require stretches of road to be pre-mapped for use. Not only that but their training data sets are better since, as you said, they collect so much data with so many vehicles on the road and that number is only exponentially increasing. Not to mention Tesla’s process the data on-board and only send relevant, edge case clips back to the company compared to others who send all the data back and it has to be cleaned up.

Treat everything potentially disruptive as ""inevitable successes"" and eventually you wind up like ARKK did this year.

Years ago on Reddit I remember people asking about how to buy HTC shares because ""VR IS THE FUTURE."" The stock is still down about 85% off the all time high of a little over a decade ago and about 39% from when the Vive was introduced in April of 2016.

""A AR/VR headset, even more expensive units, are affordable by today's standards, and will most likely drop in price over time.""

The question becomes again though, what does a future look like where everyone is wearing VR headsets. ""Wall-E"" is an exciting future to look forward to? I can see *greater* use of VR for some experiences, but the sort of selling by fans on here would seem to suggest ubiquitous, frequent use for most everything.

I can see more use out of AR glasses, but look at the reception by the public to things like Google Glass. Is the TAM as exciting as one thinks? I don't see it.

And that doesn't even get into the idea that it's not necessarily Facebook that wins this. Facebook is making this pivot in some sizable part because of a clear understanding that a pivot away from the current core business is an eventual necessity. Nothing is keeping Apple or anyone else from competing and coming up with their own VR metaverse if they think that it's worthwhile for them to do so and they don't have to have the same urgency that Meta/FB does. Or maybe the fact that Apple doesn't seem to be that interested says something - as many tech companies melt down, Apple still holding up well seemingly in part because rather than get into every big tech theme of the last decade, they've focused on the one core business that has effectively become a tech staple and did it really well.

And really I'm certainly not against growth, nor ""the future"", but the last year has been a lesson/reminder of not to go too overboard/become too enamored with hype over it.  And as much as I've liked a lot of growth themes, there's others that I've never liked (Uber/ride sharing) and others that I see as certainly put to use but in more niche instances. VR is the latter - I don't disagree with you that it will be used, but I don't see a future where it's as ubiquitous as some seem to think. Everyone spending most of their day glued to their phone isn't heathy, I don't know that everyone behind VR goggles is much of an improvement. AR at least could have a lot of strong technical use cases in the workplace, but do I think everyone's going to be walking around with AR glasses? Will society have a different reaction to another variation of Google Glass than it did the last time around? I very well might be wrong but I don't see it.

So EVGA ""feels"" it has been treated with not enough respect because of pricing info not provided soon enough? And what does ""a lack of flexibility around creative decisions"" mean? It feels more like some nonsensical thing to say in order to justify a decision that is not rationally explainable.

To me, it is a little bit like saying Apple is disrespectful to all App-builders because it takes a 30% cut on App revenue in its store. Well, they are the fastest horse in the game, ofc they have pricing power. If you dont agree, go offer you App somewhere else and gl to you. There is nothing inherently disrespectful in using your power to increase revenue. Same with nvidia. Yes they outbid some of there merchants on graphic card prices simply because they can do so now. 5 years ago they couldnt and 10 years ago noone except some hardcore gamers knew about nvidia in the first place.

inflation is likely to stay elevated for a while. older people I know are saying this feels a lot like the 1970s, which was before my time. but I trust their judgement. so I anticipate fuel/commodity problems, stagflation, etc.

Sure, you might be able to carve out an edge by constantly being at the bleeding edge of high performance chip design, but just like AMD in the end beat out Intel by “gluing together” chips, instead of fighting Moore’s Law to push single core performance ever higher, I don’t think the future will be as advantageous to companies who can push out the last 5-10% performances at absurd margins, when you can get 3 to 5 times the horsepower by spinning up lower priced hardware.

Unless fabs somehow get commoditised by future technology, I see the big 3 producers fighting it out amongst each other, and a much larger amount of smaller players duking it out when it comes to designing the chips, with the biggest customers having their own in-house chip design.

>Just like Apple has. The question is who does it first and who does it best? And who can actually meet demand?

Apple is a 1 trillion dollar company that took years to migrate and apart from Apple demand is the reason why there acren't more ARM CPU's. For almost all applications, apart from some optimized cloud workloads and low end consumer devices, ARM simply isn't an option.

The reality is the future will be complex and ARM and RISC-V will continue to gain market share, but that isn't necessarily a problem for neither Intel nor AMD because the market grows faster than they lose market share. Both are fully committed to advanced packaging techniques that already start to allow combinations of different feature sizes and in the next 12-24 months we'll hear more and more about the flexibility of the new packages. In 24-36 months it's likely we'll see the first chips having cores with multiple architectures to optimize for specific workloads and in 5 years we could see products that combine components from multiple companies on shared interconnects (I believe they already exists - sorta). This is all well in the development and production pipelines.

Not to mention we've seen extreme investments in the past few years, but combined these companies still have 100's of billions of dollars to invest, so M&A, collaborations or fierce competition are all in the cards. There'll be a lot happening in semis the coming decade, but tiny ARM pushing the majors out of the market will definitely not be one of them. Imo the ARM as a server CPU architecture is the only candidate to die of in the next few years: they MUST siege their moment right now with the few billion dollar they could scrape together in the past years, including the Ampere IPO, otherwise it will be back to custom chips and selling IP. 

In the meantime Intel is rumoured to have already started work on a chip with ARM cores for an undisclosed (but not ARM) customer - that might be even themself or a collab with NVDIA.",t3_xn8b48,1664075569.0,3

&nbsp;

Yes, which will lead to declining profit margins as pricing power continually decreases due to competition. Add to that uncertainty regarding persistence of supply chain issues ending/sticky inflation and you have a recipe for industry wide margin (and thus P/E) compression.

I don't disagree, I'm simply stating the widely consensus opinion right now that the **industry** as a whole, both current and future, faces a severe uphill battle.

I've been reading some more on ARM usage by cloud providers and some interesting takeaways

* the big three all have ARM chips in development and hired specialized staff in ARM architecture, but they seem to be producing them at Intel fabs - at least Google and AWS
* for certain (quite a lot) applications x86 emulation is becoming an economically viable alternative compared to high end native x86-64 server CPU's, expecially when energy consumption is taken into account
* all/most (as-good-as) signed Intel fab orders seem to involve ARM and/or RISC-V chips
* all ARM IP is compatible with Intels packaging standards that will be/are used for x86
* ARM seems to lack the funding for producing server CPU's at scale",t3_xn8b48,1664109542.0,3

Basically Reverse Repo Rates are fed-controlled interest on money you can deposit overnight. Essentially, what it does is keeps money out of other forms of investment. When the fed wants banks to start investing again, they will drop the reverse repo overnight rate, forcing banks to find better investments.

In terms of rules to setting price targets, there's a lot to go other and I am by no means a master at it. Factors include:  


* Your risk tolerance
* Equity price
* Market Cap
* Sector
* Company
* Expectations for growth
* Time period
* Macro setup
* Institutional/Insider positions
* Options chain
* etc...

Read the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham to start - even the first couple chapters will give you good insight on how to look at positioning.

In it, he essentially says that you should buy when you deem the investment to be at a great buying price and sell when you deem it to be a great selling price. All else is noise.

So pretty much the latter half of 2020 and 2021 I thought, wow, I really missed the boat because while they went up they weren't getting the love that some of these companies like peloton, carvana, teladoc, google, meta, etc were getting.

Now turn the tables to this year, YTD I am down 2.2%, it is nice being somewhat vindicated in my boring approach.  Will have almost 10% dividend increase this year to 76K/yr.

Back to the question.  Disney didn't fit my metrics.  And maybe it will come back but I think they are going to face headwinds for the foreseeable future.  Park income is strong, mostly on the back of them gouging the people who are still willing to go, we live in orlando and never go to disney.  I think it is still a bit over priced. I won't own it just like I won't own tesla again. Streaming seems like a bottomless money pit to me, as evidenced by pretty much every company and their performance.

The question is whether or not it's the best place to put your money.

Short term it may keep dropping because a recession looks very possible.

Medium term Disney may recover somewhat but since their streaming still isn't going to be profitable for a while will it go up even as much as the broad S&P index?  Possibly not, meaning more risk for less reward.

Longer term it's more of a crapshoot between whether Disney stock will outperform the index, and in the meantime you've taken a lot of risk and foregone shorter-term opportunities.

It's not no tech, but maybe you have 20-25% of your portfolio in tech (S and P 500 is about 24% tech), not 100% or anything remotely near that. Additionally, I think even with technology there has to be a little bit of a move away from the giant ""household names""; some tech exposure should be finding medium sized tech names that are working/can work in this environment. 

I don't own it but look at Aspen Technology, which is up this year because of what it focuses on - look at the industries on its website who are the customers and look what industries have done better this year. The stock has also done pretty well over the last couple decades. You can have some major household names as tech exposure, but branch out a bit. Doesn't have to be that, but there are some things in tech that are working. 

The era of easy monetary policy that powered a lot of tech gains over the last decade isn't coming back for a while, which Powell restated yesterday. Not something I'm thrilled with but if that's the case people have to adapt. I'd love for this to be a period where we get through it, the pivot happens and the growth party starts again but the longer this goes on the more unrealistic that feels/I don't see the conditions coming together for that happening. Feels like best case is the eventual recovery looks more 2002 post dot com.

Fanuc, Kuka and ABB are 3 of the largest industrial robot companies out there that are publicly traded. As mentioned before ROK (Rockwell Automation) is another standard in the automation department along with Siemens. Cognex is also a big player in the machine-vision department. To my knowledge all are publicly traded. 

 A large chunk of the automation building and programmming is done by relatively small, privately held companies. Metro Detroit is littered with them (where I am from). They are all 10 to 30 million dollar businesses with 10 to 150 employees with their specialties and focuses.

Truth be told, I'd compare nuts and bolts automation companies to airlines and auto manufacturers. They're huge businesses and their products are ubiquitous, however I'd argue they're not very bottom line profitable. They have huge inputs in research and development and it takes years to roll out a new or upgraded product. As I mentioned, most of the business involves a small integrator procuring the necessary equipment and spending 6 months to 2 years building, programming and testing the application. From there it's delivered to the customer. It's high risk. Most companies bid on projects on a flat rate basis. Meaning if they get it done quickly and without major hiccups they can make a good profit. If they don't then they're delivering the product to the end user at a loss.

OpenAI launched a UI to a natural language processing engine, much of which was built on the research Google has been doing for a decade and open sourcing.

This entire idea that Google was going to lose search because of ChatGPT was also completely ridiculous.  Look which search engine had the MOST growth in the last month.

BTW, I think it is now pretty obvious that Fortune 500 companies are going to adopt LLMs.  They take massive resources to train and to run in production.   Google was so smart to develop the TPUs 8 years ago.  Now with the fourth generation in production and soon to release the fifth.   The TPUs allows Google to have higher margins in the training and running the LLM models.   They are not dependent on Nvidia like all their competitors.

The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.

Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.

Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.

Also remind me again... how many manufacturers tried to go into China and failed? But we will only consider Tesla because that makes your point right? Also remind me how much China makes over here and compare that to what Tesla makes over there.

Existing China would be a economic boom for us. It would instantly force many sectors to upgrade to modern manufacturing and many will indeed return creating new jobs and our money will stay inside the USA. It will also push tech innovation even faster. They dont need to innovate much when labor is cheap. There is little pressure to do so.

Again you dont need to believe me. You have no reason to believe anyone here. But if you want a test of my theory keep an eye on EU now that they are leaving Russian gas. Watch what happens. There are pains now but I can guarantee you that in about 3 years they will have an economic boom due to bringing all that production back to their own countries. It will create tons of good paying jobs, it will actually drive down the cost of energy and their national security will be significantly improved due to no longer being dependent.

Any company with positive results is deemed as norm for that industry.  It's not entirely true because all companies are run differently but in general.

They likely want to see more than one strong Q and will begin to make moves to get back to some semblence of what they used to pay out.  

The other thing is if the fed stops raising rates (or at a slower pace) it signals inflaiton is under control.  Markets responsible well to certainty.

Some reasons to sell it:
- Opportunity cost. The remaining money is sitting there potentially doing nothing or underperforming for years. It could instead be in a solid blue chip company, or an index ETF, gaining on average 10-20% a year. 

- If you really believe in a company long term but it has been beaten down in the short term, I see no problem with holding on or averaging down your position. However, keep in mind basic math says something that is down -50% must go up 100% just to break even. -20% means +25%, etc. It could very well be a good idea to sell for tax loss harvesting purposes and wait 31 days to rebuy. Just be sure that you do actually know more about these companies than just what you hear about them on Reddit. That’s a grocery list of Reddit recommendations from 2021 if I ever saw one. Make sure you don’t just make the same mistakes over and over again. I bought Shopify after it’s big fall without doing much research and it still halved again.
- Maybe a loser just keeps losing. I saved myself a lot of pain cutting BABA when it was down 20% last year. My bags would be mighty heavy If I didn’t sell when I did. Maybe holding a stock through their whole entire downtrend is a bad idea?",t3_wxye04,1661486081.0,29

With many of those trades I would be down 60-70% but I stopped my losses at 20%. Will some of them be good businesses? Absolutely.

I have been retired for a decade by then, most of the low fruit has been harvested.  Forms are standardized, and data are scraped from them and jammed into legacy back end systems,  eliminating the data entry that occurred before. Obviously the internet changed that problem too. 

By the time I retired,  Gartner had coined the term ""Business Process Management."" Insurance companies were quick to adopt.  At its heart, there were rules engines, either procedural or AI, during the process flow of work.

 This is the answer:

There are several industries that stand to benefit significantly from cost savings due to AI advancements. Here are some of the most promising:

1. Healthcare: AI can help reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and predicting patient outcomes.

2. Manufacturing: AI can optimize manufacturing processes by predicting maintenance needs, reducing downtime, and increasing production efficiency.

3. Retail: AI can help retailers optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and personalize customer experiences, leading to increased sales and cost savings.

4. Banking and finance: AI can help banks and financial institutions automate routine tasks, detect fraudulent activity, and optimize investment strategies.

5. Transportation: AI can optimize transportation networks, reduce fuel consumption, and improve logistics, leading to significant cost savings for both shippers and carriers.

Overall, the potential cost savings from AI are significant and span across many industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more industries benefiting from its advancements.",t3_12ua2t5,1682114214.0,2

15944,iwfqvsf,t3_yvq7kp,"""It's taken a dump"" depends on your perspective.

We can all agree that tech stock prices were massively inflated at the November 21 peak. Nvidia broke $340 and I don't even remember how high their P/E ratio was. (*edit: their P/E in Oct 2021 was 79*) The crypto market was breaking ATH's like crazy and their GPU's were selling like crazy.

By October 22 it almost dropped to $100 due to revenue decreases and macroeconomic conditions but it still bounced back to $160 within a month. That's not a bad jump.

My opinion:

Nvidia is a great company. They will definitely grow in the coming years and I expect the price to go up long term and maybe even break it's previous ATH if the economy recovers (which it probably will at some point). However, I'm bearish short term as I can see their revenue growth declining sharply mainly due to less demand for their GPUs and ofc due to recession. 

My position:

I'm short on Nvidia for a few days. My opinion of course could be completely false and my stop losses trigger by Thursday and I'll probably reconsider my trading skills (which are average at best). 

If someone has more to add or disagree, I would appreciate any input.",t3_yvq7kp,1668500259.0,10

2. People who plan to exercise the contract.
3. Naked Put Sellers
4. Market Makers for Delta Hedging
5. Scalpers

Probably many more reasons why, but remember the price of the option is directly related to the price of the underlying so if you bought a call for $80 that was $8 the day prior, the only reason it’s now worth $80 the day before expiration is because it’s intrinsic value is close to $80.

Also, for every buyer, there is a seller and vice-versa.

15991,jlo4vus,t3_13rytre,"After the price run up, some people and hedge fund algorithms are trying to find the right prices for a put/call straddle that pays off with enough volatility. For example, tomorrow, NVDA is likely to be volatile, whether it moves up or down. If it closes at the same price, then that would be a seemingly unlikely event. 

You are supposed to be able to exactly calculate the values of puts and calls for a long straddle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model

However, you need to know the volatility to be able to calculate the prices. What volatility are you going to use? The volatility from the last 5 minutes? 5 years? All time? What is the drift? How do you define the drift? These problems are hard, but it doesn't stop some hedge funds from making money sometimes. Some hedge funds also lose World-Economy-Shattering sums of money. Some of the people who made the model won the Nobel prize for economics and then almost crashed world markets trading in Russia, saying that it was a sigma-six, infinitesimally improbable event and that no one could know that the value of the ruble would collapse. But that's not true at all. Even assuming Gaussian distributions for price volatility is only a first-order approximation on a distribution that may be skewed or have long tails. 

So basically some economists pretended to solve a problem by sweeping undefined variables under the rug. But, if you have an estimate of volatility and drift, you can play games with puts and calls, and your estimates will be good some of the time. That's one reason why so many shares are traded by algorithms.",t3_13rytre,1685084313.0,3

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

Google did also patent the important technology.

https://patents.google.com/patent/US10452978B2/en

OpenAI changed directions the day after the paper was released.   They used this breakthrough to create something called a Large Language Model.

This type of AI is far from perfect but showing some amazing results.   Google had been holding back as there is a serious safety concerned.

But Microsoft joining with OpenAI has decided to ignore any safety concerns and go full steam forward. 

Which has got Google to get going and also ignore the safety concerns as the horse is out of the barn.

There is a ton of money to be made with this type of AI.   Many, including myself, speculate that most Fortune 500 companies will be using this technology and will be spending a lot of money to get their business into a LLM.  Their own on top of a general one.

This type of application is also much more compute intensive than any other common Fortune 500 application.  So that means there is profits to be made by the big three, Google, Amazon and Microsoft.   Google margins should be a little better as they have the TPUs to leverage.   But this is also a big reason Nvidia is doing so well as Microsoft and Amazon will be use Nvidia for the inference.    But I suspect this is only in the intermediate term and you will see Microsoft and Amazon with their own TPU type devices so they can not be paying Nvidia the huge margins and instead enjoy for themselves.

It is interesting that Google has the patent but they let people just use the key AI breakthrough for free.   But I highly doubt they are going to force anyone to pay them or even license.  It is not how Google rolls.",t3_13w7cur,1685528746.0,5

How many firms are going to deploy these models and how many GPUs will they buy? Is crypto mining going to be hot in a 5% risk free environment? Will the Nintendo Switch 2 increase revenues?

When bear markets recover and new bull markets begin, the previous leaders are rarely the leaders coming out of the bear. This doesn't mean that the previous leaders won't perform well but the evidence suggests that the out performers will come from elsewhere.


What I have been watching are the groups that bottomed and/or outperformed since the June lows. Alternative Energy, Traditional Energy, Biotech, Healthcare Services, Cyber Security and some consumer stocks. And while these groups are more growth than value, there's also some technical evidence that value is going to outperform but that could be due to the strength of the energy group - I have to dig deeper into it. I also find it extremely interesting that Bitcoin has been able to hold the 19000 level for so long now. There might be some information there worth looking into. 🤷‍♂️


This is what is known as a top down approach to investment research. Search for strength from the top down starting at the index level. Index > Sector > Industry > Sub Group > Stock


90% plus of my portfolio is passive indexing (I'm a Boglehead at heart) but I've had a lot of success finding out performers using the top down approach along with some traditional fundamentals. 


In any event you have plenty of time to research and build a watch list.

Nvidia started running before anyone else realized there was a race underway.  It's to a point that new systems are written to fit within Nvidia architecture from the outset, they're so entrenched.

Alternatively, Google could pursue an all cash deal, where they announce a price per share they will pay for all shares of Nvidia. Once the merger settles, your shares of NVDA will disappear and you will be credited the equal amount as cash in your brokerage account. 

Or, Google could elect to do a cash and stock deal.

I just wanted to add this this can be a very interesting area of investing and is the basis for a whole class of hedge fund “merger arbitrage” funds.

There are a lot of theories and strategies out there, but the most core theory is that in a stock-for-stock deal the acquiring company’s stock will move lower and the company being acquired’s stock will move upward. This will usually happen partially during initial announcements but not all the way to the equilibrium point since there’s still that doubt whether the deal will go through that’s being discounted from the prices. The fund will investigate the probabilities of the deal going through and (usually with leverage) go long the target stock and short the acquirer’s stock.

There a whole lot more that can be done in this realm but I do just want to point out that this area forms the basis for a really fascinating style of investment, should that be something you’re curious about learning more about.",t3_119hsms,1677218960.0,1

The only threat Google really has to it is regulatory in that the government could get angry at them and decide to end their monopoly - but so far that doesn't look likely to happen and it prints money and will continue to do so for quite some time.

A common misconception is that ""because you're young"", you should invest aggressively in ""high risk high reward growth stocks"".  
This is so wrong since at a young age you have more time to let compound interest do his thing.

There's nothing wrong with stockpicking if you want to put in the time and effort to analyze and interpret different businesses in the hope you can beat the market by a respectable margin.

>7. If/when Taiwan gets invaded, TSMC will fall under Chinese control and Intel be the only western company that can make AI chips. Nvidia and AMD will be begging them for fab capacity
They say to sell the pickaxes to the gold rush. The pickaxe for AI will be the cutting edge chips, and that means Intel. Even if they don't win at making GPUs and end up selling their capacity to Nvidia.

When Meta was selling for a PE of 8, the cash flows were still there, despite capex mounting up. Intel's cash flows are gone, and at the current state of things, this whole ""Intel will dominate the chip manufacturing business"" is pure speculation, which is the reason why Intel's share price is where it is.

An investment is favourable when the best case scenario makes you a lot of money, whereas the worst-case scenario does not make you end up with a substantial permanent loss of capital.

2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago….. when they had a technology lead!!  Now they are 2-3 years behind. 

3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment…. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.

4- profits are going to decrease tremendously…. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry….how will they compete but on cost?

5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space…. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?

AI = GPUs and custom silicon... Intel has nothing to offer there. It's a one man show with NVIDIA right now and later this year AMD offering their own MI100 chips. And yeah those comments from Nvidia were certainly encouraging for Intel but that doesn't mean the pickaxes will be fabbed in the US rather than Taiwan and South Korea - though Intel getting up to the standard that they can even be used by NVDA as a bargaining chip to haggle for lower prices with TSMC is a good sign for them.

You realize the bill isn't just money for Intel, right? That's why its called the CHIPS Act, not the INTEL Act. The US is subsidizing their direct competitor TSMC to build a fab in Arizona.

|Revenue|15.2 - 16bn (-14% YoY)|18.16bn|
|Operating Margin|39.5% - 41.5% (-17.5% YoY)|49.1%|
|Operating Income|6bn - 6.6bn (-29% YoY)|8.9bn|

The finances of companies change quickly, especially for a chip company.

The decline is a stark contrast to their 3-year history where they doubled their revenues.

I think it will be some years before the next boom cycle begins. Remember you're calculating their PE ratio based on the peak of the cycle, and the stock price is looking towards the decline part of their cycle. You want to invest when their valuation is high (because earnings are at the trough of the cycle) and the cycle is beginning to boom.

If you reduce their earnings by 30% (as per their -29% YoY guidance), PE goes up from 14 to 20.

Another factor is that earnings is just an accounting figure - includes depreciation which was spent 5 years ago, and it doesn't factor in expenditure today.

Their Q1 2018 capex was 2.5bn.

Their Q1 2023 depreciation is 3.6bn.

Their Q1 2023 capex is 9.93bn. This means higher depreciation charge going forward which reduces EPS.

Their Q1 FCF = 2.7bn which is well below their net income of 6.8bn.

There is not a chance in hell their capex is ever going to go back to 2.5bn.

Their FCF for the last 4 quarters is 16.1bn, which gives a P/FCF ratio of 27.9.

For comparison, ASML's capex in 2018 (full year) only increased from 0.60bn EUR to 1.32bn EUR.

ASML's P/FCF ratio is 31.5 which is not that much higher than TSM's P/FCF.

ASML's guidance

&#x200B;

||Q2 2023 (guidance in USD)|Q2 2022|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|\~7.02 - 7.56bn (27.8% YoY)|5.7bn |
|Operating Margin|30% (no change)|30%|
|Operating Profit|2.1 - 2.27bn (26% YoY)|1.73bn|

ASML expects full year 2023 sales to be 25% greater than 2022.

Unless TSM's guidance is really bad and they out deliver massively, it's clear that they are NOT cheap when looking at their negative revenue growth expectations and lagging earnings numbers due to their capex increasing 4x in 5 years.

ASML is justifiably valued higher as their revenue growth is still intact and capex has only increased 2-3x. (Reminder that TSM's higher capex is good for ASML, since they're one of ASML's customers).",t3_13ojkpc,1684742730.0,8

Actually, [Taiwan officially claims](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/taiwans-status-geopolitical-absurdity/593371/) the entirety of mainland China as its own.

>The ROC constitution, meanwhile, still claims Taiwan, China, Mongolia, and the entire South China Sea as its territory, reflecting Chiang’s desire to restore control over areas the Qing Dynasty ruled or claimed at its height, before European, Japanese, and American colonialism began eating away at it.

The **only difference** between China's claim and Taiwan's claim is that China is now significantly more powerful and actually has the ability to retake Taiwan while Taiwan has zero ability to retake mainland China.

Because of this shift in power, Taiwan now wants to officially declare independence but China still won't let it. The moment Taiwan declare independence is the moment China will invade.

China and Taiwan's history are extremely complicated and far more nuanced than the ""good vs evil"" western media likes to label. Western media likes to portray China as imperialists (like they are).

Companies over ordered last year so they expect a slowdown this year which should moderate out over the following years. 

Even with the recent decline their price is up 390% over the last ten years. They’ve also beat the market across pretty much every two year period since the dot com bubble which indicates to me the market has been undervaluing them pretty consistently for quite a while.

On Capex do you have any idea how much of those figures is due to replacing existing assets that are at the end of their useful life versus new capital investments. That would be very useful in gaging if those elevated capex numbers are permanent feature going forward.

My general long term view is that TSM makes the most advanced chips that are essential to every tech company that wants to build software that uses lots of data.

The CCP (and Hong Kong's government) decided that lockdowns were necessary because they did not have access to Moderna and Pfizer. Nothing wrong with that. Asian culture is very conservative when it comes to spreading diseases. You'll see people in Japan, HK, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan wear masks on a daily basis well **before** **Covid** was even a thing.

The covid rules were more of a symptom of Asian culture and the lack or MRNA vaccines in China. Hong Kong did not have draconian lockdowns and for as long as mainland China did.

>As well as the increased amount of censorship and banning of certain culturally important things such as after-school tutoring? Entire educational sectors collapsed.

There is no censorship in Hong Kong. You can say whatever the hell you want. You can access FB, Instagram, Google, whatever. You just can't say that you want to help Hong Kong succeed from China. Fair.

Banning after school tutoring? No. They just banned for-profit tutoring. **And it did not apply to Hong Kong's education market.**

>These factors have all largely been introduced post 2020. I've actually only visited recently cause pre-2022 it was nigh-impossible for a foreigner to gain entrance.

If you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.

I'm no expert but a quick Google search shows Nvidia's first GPU ever had a recommended 200 watts. A 3080 is under 400 watts. The difference in performance and capabilities between those are, well practically like Atari vs high end VR.

If someone wants a more energy efficient GPU they can go for a lower end GPU and use software to reduce the output and therefore the power drain. It's something that already exists, you can run at 70%. Why would they make a new line of GPU's that are not better than the last when you can just buy one of the previous generations or throttle the GPU?

Yes we do require the performance increases they are putting out every year. And again, there are a number of them in the line. You are actually describing what they do. The 3050 is similar in performance to the 1660 super (3 year old GPU) and the 3050 is recommended 350 watts and the 1660 is recommended 470 watts.

Performance increases inherently = power efficiency.

Again, if performance increases were linear with wattage no one would be able to run them.

Again, customers are idiots. They want the 3090 at 200 watts when that's just not going to be a thing *now*. Eventually they will release the 6060 or something which will be equivalent to the 3090 performance at lower wattage and drain.

People want a rocket ship that runs on a AA battery and obviously if that technology existed it would be for sale.

the energy isn't a major concern about cost of the electric bill, its the associated cost of cooling components and power supply companies fighting Nvidia about spiking power very haphazardly that they want a fix for.

power supply companies are in a fit over new GPU power growing while not  solving spiking issues. So now power supply companies have to upgrade to a new standard and increase size/power of components at the cost of higher prices for customers. 

so now the new standard has comms between the GPU and power supply to try and remedy the issue and make everyone happy, but the kicker is people are going to have to buy new power supplies to go with their new 40 series graphics cards that are already going to be very expensive and short supply. Customers are going to be pissed and many will just refuse to buy into these cards that are only nice for 4k gaming which no one really does in the competitive sense because higher fps for 1080p or 1440 is already past the point of what the human eye can detect currently, with future games this might change as they get more power hungry graphically.

what we are seeing now is a flooding of used Mining GPUs entering the used market along with stock of 30 series cards starting to be discounted and sold to make room for the 40s, customers are snapping up MSRP cards after 2 years of stupid insane prices. The chances they sell crazy amount of 40s early on is going to be hard to predict, my guess is consumers not interested in chasing fps are going to sit out for a few years and let them come back to MSRP or a little less before making the switch from 20/30 to the 40 series much like how DDR5 ram is stupidly priced for its performance compared to DDR4 currently.

people wanting performance are actually under volting their gpu/cpu to maintain longer boost clocks for better performance, many of the GPUs don't get better performance from cranking up the voltage because their boost clock is so short lived it is only useful for benchmarking not normal gaming. Sure if you can cool your card better you get a slight performance but this is only because it remains in the boost clock for longer periods before being thermally throttled.",t3_vzdpre,1657903302.0,0

That's like saying nobody is going to buy the gen 12 Intel CPU because it's a new socket so nobody is going to want to buy a new motherboard. Also those cards will still accept the older PSU connections it just won't be as high of a power availability. People will be upset but it won't have a huge impact on sales.

This is a way higher impact than power consumption which is what OP was asking about.

demand will be higher than supply yes, but if the assumption they will spend way over MSRP was the case why would Nvidia push back the release to give room to clearing out 30s stock? I think they know people are going to sit and wait and won't pay over MSRP like they have in the past especially with looming recession/inflation. I know personally i will keep my 3080 I recently picked up at MSRP to replace my 2080S i had for the past 2 years and wait for 40s to come back down to reality pricing. People were over paying for GPUs due to Mining craze driving prices up and attracting more scalpers trying to make a quick buck.

I don't need a 20-25% boost in fps at a 50 to 60% jump in price, once more games come out that actually need that kind of power the price will drop back down to MSRP and i can pick up a better deal, I can't be the only consumer thinking like this and I imagine the people who got burned these past 2 years paying way over MSRP are going to be way more cautious about their future GPU purchases.

Admittedly i don't have a need for max FPS so maybe i could be very wrong and consumers are just that stupid with their money. I am not a pro gamer and would rather spend my money on monitor/VR headset tech to actually handle the FPS my 3080 can put out. For me I value Vram more especially with VR becoming more mature, I already eat over 11GB Vram just joining a 20-40 person VRchat world before on my 2080S it would throttle badddd above 12-15 people with unoptimized avatars in rooms. Pro gamers tend to game low settings for max FPS, 3090's were overkill just like how 4080's will be overkill for most current gen games. 4090s are just stupid levels of performance for the avg to advanced consumer, only professional work environments could fully utilize that running heavy Machine Learning or huge 3D cad models. 3060 ti was the best performance/$ card last gen, i would assume the 4060 ti will likely be the same and released much latter than the initial 70s/80s/90s because people just don't need 4k high fps when they get even more fps at 1080p or 1440p and spend the difference on a much higher refresh monitor.",t3_vzdpre,1657905871.0,0

You answered the question. They have a lot of stock on the 30s. They understand that demand for the new cards is always high. They also aren't doing to raise the prices crazy high on the 40s. And then theres the rumored increase in performance. So who would buy a 30 series when you can get a 40 at the same price or even lower if you step down a tier and still get the same it better performance?

AMD will never be as profitable as NVDA like you mentioned they don't have the same products, skill and resource to compete. But NVDA is notorious for jumping on threads for example crypto mining and now AI. Whereas AMD is more quiet and doing it's thing in the background. To me I like the quiet nature of AMD, plus Su has done a great job and the leadership is solid. This is where I fell in love with AMD, they did an amazing job bring the company back to relevance and beating out Intel. This was their closet competition and they finally beat them out. They will not hold a touch light to NVDA because they don't operate and feed on hype.
 Now the cost of entry is another point, NVDA is higher than AMD, and looking at both business models I felt AMD was a solid option.
Don't get me wrong NVDA is the better company, I just don't like when they get on hype train and pump their stocks. In the end NVDA will always dictate the market and sentiment for AMD. So I say why not have both. With AI, I know NVDA will milk the hell out of this hype, I have no doubt about that. 
When it comes to PC, AMD has done a good job caving out a market for themselves, so although you go for the recognizable brand, AMD positions themselves to be the option for every other person and use case. This will be my final piece, let's say AI just died tomorrow and was not a thing, AMD will survive better than NVDA, because of their business model. AI dying probably won't happen but you get my point

Additionally, putting out a new tool only available by what would have to be a very expensive subscription bars people from learning it.  Adobe student subscriptions have been a loophole for years.

Gaming was down 46% YoY. That it was up in the quarter that included Q4 is normal. Professional Visualization and OEM down as well. Yes auto is strong, but data center is up only 11% YoY and down 6% QoQ. For a company that prices in 30% growth for a decade that is too little.

Yes. The problem is that Nvdia already is the dominant force in their sectors. That means one is betting on 30% growth of those industries. Given that interest rates are 5% now, and the bank that used to give loans to many startups is now bust, I doubt that a 30% growth will happen.
