These shovels, however, aren't just ordinary spades, but rather glittering tools of wonder like NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, ASML's magic lithography wands, and TSMC's almighty hammer of semiconductor creation.  

But wait! The high price-to-earnings ratios and market capitalizations of these companies might seem like clouds in the sky of your financial prosperity. But fear not, for these companies have built walls as strong as a castle made of jellybeans, guarded by dragons made of cotton candy.  For instance, NVIDIA's GPUs are like the steering wheel of a spaceship navigating through the vast galaxies of data centers, autonomous vehicles, and gaming systems. The company's grip on these markets, combined with its constant innovation and R&D, make it a force to be reckoned with, like a superhero made of marshmallows.  

In the same vein, ASML's lithography machines are like the pen of a wizard, casting spells to create advanced semiconductors. The company has a monopoly as strong as a fortress made of gingerbread, in this market. TSMC, on the other hand, has positioned itself as the go-to choice for chip creation, like a genie granting wishes for companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD.  

As the world advances towards the future, with AI and technology as its beacon, these companies are like rockets ready to soar, like a kite on a windy day. It's like what the Pied Piper of Hamelin said, ""The journey of AI is long, but it dances towards the future."" And as AI continues to dance in this direction, the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, ASML's lithography machines, and TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will only escalate, like a party that never ends. 

Investing in these companies is like taking a ride on a roller coaster of wealth, with the future as your destination. The gold miners may come and go, but the shovel sellers will always be in demand, like a song that never grows old. So, grab your shovels, put on your dancing shoes, and let's strike gold!

On a more serious note, what do you guys think about TSML, ASML, NVDA capturing all the investment into the GPT and LLM hype train?"

I like AI/ML, a lot. This shit’s gonna change the world - especially Large Language Models like Chat GPT. It’s like the invention of the search engine on steroids. Chat GPT [Passes Medical License Exam, Bar Exam.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/chatgpt-passes-medical-license-exam-bar-exam-after-top-performance-on-wharton-mba-final) It will write papers, code, problem solve, strategize for you - you name it. 1 programmer who knows LLMs is worth 4 programmers who don't; learn to use them, or get left in the dust.

https://preview.redd.it/9jfmnj1bcrga1.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bba536dfed71ac53b7d79212f5949c6ede036561

But the most obvious, pressing issue is with “get some poor asian kid on the other side of the world to do your homework for you” Chegg. This company has not sufficiently prepared for the reckoning.

I've used Chat GPT for my own Computer Organization & Architecture HW and Computer Science HW (as a learning tool \*wink\*). It's an amazing, versatile tool if you put sufficient details in the prompt, whiiiiiich is why it’s superior to Chegg.

It can solve problems that haven't even been added to their database yet - like concerning new assignments or material from new professors. You can also ask it to elaborate and explain certain problem-solving steps, which Chegg cannot provide if there's only one solution uploaded - you've got as much as the poor asian kid decided to write down 💀

[College students](https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html) are the most significant demographic of Chegg, and the competition of free vs. $15/mo for generally low cash flow customers is a no brainer. If you’re concerned about the plan for premium Chat GPT, according to [CEO Sam Altman](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-plus-free-openai-paid-version-chatbot-2023-2)  “users will still be able to access the chatbot for free” post release.

While Chat GPT doesn't have verification of veracity (truthfulness) nor precise equation manipulation yet, we can expect it and competing AIs to pursue such features moving forward. If equation solver-extraordinaire Wolfram Alpha has been publicly available for the ballpark of a decade, it does not seem like a stretch that this technology will be difficult to implement. Google’s equivalent “Apprentice Bard” is also coming “very soon” according to [CEO Sundar Pichai.](https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-sparks-googles-upcoming-ai-upgrade/)

# Ok so it seemed too good to be true,

so I investigated to see if Chegg was working on integrating AI - since that would be a potential safeguard to retain clients they’ve lost since the pandemic (their peak when everyone was cheating at online school) has dwindled.

# Lol.

And while the CEO swooped in 2 days later to stop the bleeding, he made [no substantial defense](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chegg-ceo-talks-skills-based-155112040.html) against the looming threat of Chat GPT and other LLMs coming soon.

Their last big AI news, as far as I've been able to tell, was the acquisition of WriteLab (basically a grammarly type fixer) in May 2018! Present day, they're either internally freaking out or execs are oblivious that their product is about to be made obsolete.

Only 5 days ago are [milquetoast, boring investors](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/01/chatgpt-completely-changed-my-mind-about-this-grow/?source=eptyholnk0000202) starting to turn on Chegg. They have no idea of the Chat GPT storm coming.

Here is a link for the story.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-husband-just-bought-151000595.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-husband-just-bought-151000595.html)

Apparently, you dufuses don't know how bills work their way through congress.  

First of all, the original bill to subsidize chipmakers was introduced in 2020.  Here it is if you don't believe me:  [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7178](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7178)

You will notice that the actual bill that incorporated the previous session's bill was incorporated in a bill that passed in January 2021.  [https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does)

The vote that Paul Pelosi supposedly had inside information on was to merely provide the $52 billion to make sure the bill passed in 2021 is implemented.  [https://fortune.com/2022/06/28/globalwafers-intel-tsmc-congress-semiconductor-plants-chips-act-funding/#:\~:text=Congress%20actually%20passed%20the%20CHIPS,and%20funding%20for%20the%20year](https://fortune.com/2022/06/28/globalwafers-intel-tsmc-congress-semiconductor-plants-chips-act-funding/#:~:text=Congress%20actually%20passed%20the%20CHIPS,and%20funding%20for%20the%20year).

So, we have a bill introduced in 2020, passed in 2021, and funded in 2022, but please tell me how Paul Pelosi is dirty. Instead of acting like he's dirty, maybe we should follow his lead, and track legislation that we can use to find winning stocks.

We should return to the original intent of this sub where we find little gems where we can make some money before the big dogs jump in.  I mean heck, Rule #5 of this sub literally says no ""Political Bullshit"".

Peace and Love.  Go make some money."

Kathy Manning, D-N.C., scooped up thousands of dollars in semiconductor company stock just one day before voting to pass a bill providing massive subsidies to the sector, new disclosures show. One of the companies is already planning large-scale investments made possible due to the legislation.

Manning and her husband purchased up to $30,000 in Micron Technology stocks and up to $95,000 in Nvidia stocks on July 27, the new disclosures show. The next day, Manning voted to pass the CHIPS Act, which will help expand semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States while providing the industry tens of billions of dollars in subsidies.

The legislation received plenty of media attention prior to the vote, particularly concerning stock investments made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband.

""I'm proud of my vote to pass this historic investment in American CHIP manufacturing, lower costs, and creating good-paying jobs,"" Manning tweeted after the vote.

Manning's congressional office told Fox Business the investments ""are in accounts entirely controlled by third party managers"" and that she and her husband ""have no discretion or control over the underlying assets held in the accounts.""

""Neither Congresswoman Manning nor her husband exercised, or attempted to exercise, any control or direction over any transactions executed within the accounts,"" the office said.

""Congresswoman Manning supported the CHIPS Act to maintain semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States because it creates good-paying American jobs and protects national security,"" they added.

74,"“During a gold rush, sell shovels.” - Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) & Autonomous Vehicles",278,13l3z7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13l3z7b/during_a_gold_rush_sell_shovels_advanced/,109,1684428076.0,"“**During a gold rush, sell shovels.”** This saying arose following the California gold rush of the mid-19th century when it became clear that few prospectors made money panning for gold while the suppliers who sold them shovels and picks profited nicely. 

**I. Introduction** 

This due diligence report focuses on the *Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)* and Autonomous Vehicles sector. It aims to provide an overview of the industry, including the latest technological advancements, market trends, and investment opportunities within this rapidly evolving field. Mainly, employing the strategy of ""During a gold rush, sell shovels."" The aim is to identify key products and companies within the supply chain that can benefit from the industry's growth and technological advancements. 

**II. Autonomous Driving Technologies Industry Overview**

ADAS & Autonomous Vehicles industry is experiencing significant growth and transformation, driven by evolving consumer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory initiatives. These technologies aim to enhance road safety, increase transportation efficiency, and provide improved mobility options. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning algorithms to perceive the environment and make informed driving decisions. In USA, this industry is regulated by the *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).*

Automakers are moving past passive safety (airbags, seal belts, etc..) into active safety (ADAS features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, etc...).

Automobile OEMs are racing to deliver the first automobile offering level 4 ADAS system. Mercedes currently has level 3 offering to consumers. ADAS unlock a major source of subscription-based revenue for automobile OEMS. 

ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by *The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)*. ADAS can be divided into 5 levels:

[5 levels of ADAS\/AVs](https://preview.redd.it/fzfjl9nn5m0b1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88f6a64d59eda5088696454a11be86b0c71bb758)

**III. Government Regulation**

*National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)* and other agencies around the globe will regulate ADAS requirements and standards. Germany is leading the way with the USA following closely behind. Most likely, AVs will be required to have more than one type of sensor (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonics/sonar) to offer level 3 and above ADAS features. This is due to requiring a high degree of redundancy for safety reasons. 

In my personal opinion, Tesla's pure camera vision is a bust. This is evident by the increasing number of accidents involving Tesla when Autopilot was engaged. Also, certain environmental factors can hinder cameras useless (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc..). Elon will never admit this and will blame his failures on government interference. 

**IV. Technological Advancements in the Supply Chain**

 The ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry has witnessed a surge in investments and strategic partnerships, indicating the growing interest and confidence in this sector. Established automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively pursuing collaborations to leverage their respective expertise and accelerate the development and commercialization of ADAS and autonomous vehicles. 

ADAS = Chipmakers + Real Time Operating System + Automotive Cloud + Sensors + Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 

*Chipmakers:*

* Mobileye (Spun off, but still controlled, by Intel)
* Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion Platform
* Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Flex Soc

*Real Time Operating System (RTOS):*

* BlackBerry QNX already has deals with automotive OEMs to offer them their RTOS.

*Automotive Cloud:*

* Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (powered Microsoft Azure)
* Blackberry IVY (powered by Amazon AWS)

*Sensors:*

* Microvision (LiDAR) - Most likely, all AVs that offer level 3 ADAS and above will need to be equipped with a lidar sensor. The LiDAR sector has consolidated, and MVIS aims to take over 50% of the automotive market. MVIS shareholders just authorized an additional 100 million shares. Currently, a major squeeze is being anticipated. Get in while you can!

*Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:*

* ADAS is going to be a major revenue stream for automotive OEMs. Most likely, will be a subscription-based model.
* All the automotive OEMs have their own version. The race to offer Level 3 and above is currently underway. Here are a few examples:
* Autopilot by Tesla
* Bluecruise by Ford
* Super Cruise by GM
* Subaru Eyesight
* Honda Automated Drive
* Mercedes Drive Pilot (level 3)
* ETC...

**V. Conclusion**

When considering investment opportunities in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle sector, it is essential to identify companies that demonstrate technological leadership, strong partnerships, and a clear roadmap for future growth. These companies are likely to be at the forefront of innovation and well-positioned to capitalize on the market trends and evolving consumer demands.

In conclusion, the ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry is witnessing a transformative phase characterized by increased investment and strategic partnerships. Automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to advance technology, share resources, and accelerate the market adoption of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.

I want to bring to the table something that you will feel offended by, value investing in something with growth potential.

All of you heard about semiconductors but do you know how semiconductors are born ? If your answer is daddy semi porks mama semi and later baby semi is born...you belong here but you are wrong.

The attached picture should be enough to describe the process for the average WSB dweller.
Today I don't want to discuss about boring Intel, Nvidia, AMD, TSMC and so on....I want to focus on the raw material right before the chips are created, the hyper-pure silicon wafers.

TOP players in this area :

No#1 Shinetsu Chemical - Japan - Market share ~30% - P/E ratio = 9.5
No#2 SUMCO - Japan - Market Share ~25% - P/E ratio = 8.8
No#3 SK Siltron - South Korea - Market Share ~18.1% - Private company
No#4 Siltronic AG - Germany - Market Share ~14% - P/E ratio = 5.8
No#5 GlobalWafers - Taiwan - Market Share ~12% - P/E ratio = 13.1

Do you know what No#1, No#2, No#3 and No#5, accouting for ~85% of worlds hyper-pure silicon wafers market share, have in common ?

From geo-political perspective they are in a high tension area neigbouring China and North Korea.
In case of Japan companies ( ~55% market share ) they also have the natural disaster risk: remember the tsunami that caused the Fukushima NPP disaster which in turn created a supply chain issue for chips.

So we are left with Siltronic AG ( ticker ""WAF"" for Frankfurt exchange or US ADR ""SLTCY"" ):
- based in Germany with manufacturing sites domestic and as well in Singapore and USA.
- Mkt. cap= 2.1 billion , P/E = 5.8x, Div. yeld= 4.2%, P/B = 1.2x, EPS = 12.25, Net profit margin = 21.5%, Debt/Equity = 18.7%, P/S = 1.3x, EV/EBITDA = 2.6x
- institutional ownership 42.3%
- Cash flow from operating activities Q1-Q3 2022 = 614.9 million Euro ( in Q1-Q3 2021 = 303.9 million Euro )
- Free cash flow Q1-Q3 2022 = 29.3 million Euro ( in Q1-Q3 2021 = 155.4 million Euro )
- Capex increased in 2022 to 585.6 million due to investments in Singapore production plant and expansion of crystal pulling hall in Germany

If you believe in technical astrology you can see in attached chart a potential inverse head and shoulders formation ( bullish ) on the daily.

Conclusion:
Siltronic looks positioned very well in a niche area that can only grow in the future and it currently trades at a low premium offering a dividend on top."

Hello fellow degenerates, I am back after a brief hiatus. I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I’ve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson & Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY’s total assets. All that being said, let’s dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market.

Consumer Price Index (June YoY & MoM) \- Wednesday

The consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bull Take

Well, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bear Take

If the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Retail Sales (MoM) - Friday 

Retail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bull Take

If Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bear Take

If retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Michigan Consumer Sentiment

First, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bull Take

Ironically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bear Take

Consumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My Personal Opinion

Much of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn’t still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy’s dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. 

Additionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Exit Plan:

By all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \~$750 gain in a few days on a \~$3,000 investment. 

If I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. 

In a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point. This would be done to save some capital and have a chance at recouping my losses. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR 

Higher than forecasted inflation + Higher than forecasted Consumer sentiment + Higher than forecasted Retail Sales = JPow hiking rates and sending us full speed ahead into a recession, crushing equities and therefore making lots of money for bears. If you do not comprehend the above sentence, here is a one month SPY chart, I’m buying $380 strike puts, I’m not asking for the apocalypse, just a nice short term dip, who cares what happens after. (SPY bottomed out at $362.17).

92,NVDA - Saw Jensen’s Commencement Speech and very impressed,190,13urdeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13urdeh/nvda_saw_jensens_commencement_speech_and_very/,53,1685357243.0,"Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.

CEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.

Here's what he said:

LESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help

Nvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. 

From Jensen:

""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...

I contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. 

I was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.

Confronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.""

LESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream

In 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. 

From Jensen:

""Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...

We suffered many years of poor performance. 

Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...

This journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.""

LESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work

In 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.

From Jensen:

""The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...

Nvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. 

We should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...

Our strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.

To retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. 

Retreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.""

//

Jensen wrapped up the speech with this:

""Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:

1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.
2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.
3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.""




Damn, this give speech gives me Steve Jobs vibes. I am even more impressed with Nvidia’s leadership now as a shareholder."

Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.

The chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.

Although  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.

**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**

“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”

A spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. 

Wood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.

Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).

The bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isn’t correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report.

Lets talk about today and really the last week of trading…

I mentioned that since FOMC I was shocked to see the strength of the market continue and that no matter how hard bears attempted to get momentum it just seemed they were never quite able to take over. The bears would appear to be getting support only for the bulls to turn very clear bearish daily structured candles back into bullish structured candles by the EOD. 

Today though the bears finally struck and they struck in a pretty devesating way in my opinion. So lets talk about it here… On a side note this was one of the strongest bearish momentum and trend days I have seen since December… We actually did not close a single candle over the 15min 5ema today which even on a bullish trend day is not an easy feat… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cqzww26e59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=de07de1e9bf3787034f0bdae465a131a9e918ce3

Taking a look at the daily on SPY here I mentioned on Tuesday when JPOW spoke that we did infact lose the support of the bull channel that was 7 weeks long. I then mentioned that I was extremely surprised when SPY continued to push higher intraday. However we ended up closing out that inside day yesterday which left room for the bulls or the bears to take over today and start the next leg… 

Something I mentioned in my video but I don’t think I covered in the written TA was that after the WSJ interview in November (which was a massive 3% green day) we actually put the top in the very next day and then started a multi day sell off leading into CPI. If you compare that pattern to here then tomorrow should effectively be a bear trend day too. 

Today the bears managed to not only hold under that blue breakout resistance line, then broke through key 410.5 support and closed below the daily 8ema support for the first time since January 19th. 

The question now is will bulls be able to turn this massive break down into a 407 double bottom or are we going to see SPY put in even a bigger sell off tomorrow to retest some critical supports? We now have 2 trading days left before CPI (Friday and Monday… with the print Tuesday pre- market). We still have NOT gotten an official CPI YoY consensus released yet… That should come tomorrow unless they hold it till Monday. I believe last CPI it was released the day before also… 

Here is what I am seeing. I mentioned since we broke through 405.2 on FOMC and never back tested it again that we should look with that failure at 418.3 to reach 419.5 for a retrace back to test that support. With us now $1.8 from key 405.3 support we should look for that to be tested tomorrow. IF bulls can defend 405.3 then we very well could see this turn into a huge double bottom tomorrow and close the week on a bullish note. 

However, if we lose 405.3 tomorrow I would not be surprised to see an even deeper retest of support. The next major support is 400.6. Depending on what tomorrow brings that is what I will be eyeing. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/psad5cpe59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66df7738cbe8958188d9a4df34da1601939b8e2d

I don’t like talking about the weekly intraweek.. but currently spy weekly is showing that last week/ this week was the top of this rally. Which if you remember I have been saying since JPM collar day that historically we see the trend continue for about 7 weeks post collar roll and then we will see a reversal… this perfectly aligns with CPI next week (meaning regardless of what CPI brings I expect downside). 

Currently tomorrow IF we lose 405.8 support we break the 7 week long weekly bull channel support. This should lead to a retest of 399 and potentially even as low as 390.1 support. 

However, if the bulls can retake 408.8 but realistically 412.5 by EOD tomorrow this candle could give upside to 419.5 to 427.5 for next week. 

Key SPY Support- 407 -> 405.3 -> 403 -> 400.6

Key Spy Resistance- 410.6 -> 414.4

&#x200B;

I told you guys I LOVE to trade SPY but utilize futures in congruence with SPYs charts for taking positions and catching trends. 

I mentioned yesterday that futures had not broken its bull channel support and that it actually had a really beautiful breakout/ down triangle formed. I did however, also mentioned that I saw more of a bull flag then a breakdown coming. However, today futures massively rejected 4130, broke through the bull channel support (that means spy and futures both are through support) and closed below its daily 8ema. 

Not only that but presumptively here futures is going to close below its critical level of 4095. This level is similar to the criticalness that 405.3 holds on SPY. 

With a break down through that support and closing under it here presumptively we should expect to see a further sell off. The one interesting thing about the futures daily chart compared to that of SPYs is that futures has these very large “pockets” of support/ resistance. 

So what I mean by this is take a look at the “double” support/ resistance lines at 4133/ 4145, 4085/4095, 4030/4040. We have these areas where there are major gaps in price action. One of those areas was 4085 to 4133 prior to this week. And now we still have this large untraded area on Futures with a “gap” (really just a lack of price action) from 4040 to 4085. 

What I will be looking for tomorrow is a break down and retest of key support near 4030/4040. However, if the bulls before 5pm today (when candle closes) can get this back over 4095 AND hold that level all night long… we MIGHT just see a huge recovery tomorrow. However, with the daily 8ema being closed below on SPY and Futures that SHOULD lead to at last one more day of downtrend. 

Historically speaking touching an EMA like the 8ema (much like yesterday) does not indicate that it will continue in that direction. Actually most of the time a touch but no close under an EMA leads to a reversal from where it came from. However, in generally once the 8ema is breached one way or another we see at least one more day of continuation. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x1oivbqf59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e64aa9bef34d507410f4893ae901cb044fb91253

Very similar pattern playing out here on futures weekly as SPY. Futures weekly support for this 8 week long bull channel sits at 4060 for tomorrow. As you can see on futures weekly that 4095 level is a very critical pivot level. Closing back under that tomorrow would certainly open up a move back to 3970-4020 next week (depending on CPI). 

The futures weekly and spy weekly candles are both inside candles as of right now. Which does historically mean a continuation. However, as you can see both of them are also reversal doji candles… when we look back at all of the tops on SPY pretty much all of those peaks (not the short peaks but the true peaks) happen after a weekly candle puts in a reversal doji. 

Key Futures Support- 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 -> 4010

Key Futures Resistance- 4095 -> 4133 -> 4145 -> 4177

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jod12gag59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2a9eb55e850da68dcfab58a41706e5990eed6eb

Is the Tesla top finally in? no one ones… honestly the fact that SPY put in almost a -1% day and dropped almost 2% total intraday… YET Tesla managed to close green is just beyond impressive. You just cant be mad at it for continuing to rip like this. 

Anyways with todays green close on Tesla it now has tied its 2nd best green streak of 8 days in a row. The longest streak as I mentioned yesterday was 10 days in a row. 

However, Taking a look at Tesla here we very well COULD see a red day tomorrow. I have mentioned this classic abandoned baby pattern with a huge reversal doji like this time and time again. This pattern is a very high probability setup for a reversal. Not only do we have a classic reversal set up we also attempted to breakout over the daily 200ema today and failed and have left a gap up yet again. Gap fill is at 203. 

With the overall market weakness today in SPY and the rest of tech and speculative assets all taking a major hit today and breaking their up trends… we absolutely should be looking for downside here on Tesla tomorrow. However, its Tesla so we very well could see a -2% red day on SPY and a 8% green day on Tesla and it wouldn’t surprise me… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5kkzr2sg59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=96ba1ad91d542b93fdbb3704dead0c7cec4877c7

Something to also note here on the Tesla weekly chart is that we did break through the support of that 5 week long bull channel (its hard to tell but it DID wick through it) and we also attempted to break over that next major weekly resistance at 208.5 today and found ourselves with a hard rejection. I will be watching this weekly candle close very closely. This much like SPY and Futes is set up for a reversal (gravestone) doji pattern depending on what happens tomorrow. 

For me on Tesla IF it closes over 208.5 tomorrow I honestly fully expect next week for it to touch 228+. However, if it does give up some of it gains tomorrow and closes somewhere near 200 then I really do expect this to turn into a reversal candle and lead to downside next week. 

Key Tesla Support- 201.3 -> 196 -> 190.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 207.8 -> 215 -> 219.3

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jj7czd4i59ha1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a53d334e3616a2f3d03335b3528c991c986d6d3

The VIX is extremely important to factor into not only tomorrow but what happens next week and had a major breakout over key resistance. 

Now what have I always said? IF SPY and the VIX are both in congruence (opposing pattern) then it is a HIGH probability setup… So lets talk about this here… 

On Tuesday when SPY broke through its bull channel support AND the VIX broke through the 4 month long resistance I said that was an extremely important time and that we should absolutely be keeping an eye on that. 

Now today SPY rebroke the restructured support (honestly we didn’t even need to redraw it but we did incase the rally continued), Futures broke its bull channel support AND the VIX re-broke (again didn’t NEED to restructure it but had to incase it was a fake breakout here) resistance line. Not only did the VIX break through that blue resistance line it also broke through 19.7, confirmed the daily 8ema as support and closed back over the daily 20ema with the highest close that the VIX has had since January 11th. 

So where do we head next? Well that is a really good question. 

When we factor in that the markets have been rallying through all opposition, through all negative data, through all the fed speakers and basically through everything that has been thrown at it with no pullback, SPY and Futures breaking a major support line AND the VIX breaking through key resistance, with CPI coming in 3 days I would not be surprised when we look at historical trends for the markets to see a sell off tomorrow. 

If you think about it.. If you are position long and especially if you are highly profitably through all of this breaking out and you have also ignored everything the fed has said for the last month and now CPI is 3 day away you might consider taking profits. That as you saw today has a tendency of starting a massive waterfall on the markets. 

Now the question will be for tomorrow… Are the bulls going to regather support and finish this week on a bullish note or are we finally going to see markets go risk off and we see a decent sized sell off back to key supports leading into CPI?

Today much like the rest of the week has been very difficult and frustrating to trade and heres why. 

This morning I recognized that futures was failing to break through (And spy but mostly futures this time) key resistance levels and that there was starting to be weakness in the charts and the VIX did not sell off like one would have expected with a big open. In watching that I really wanted to go short this morning (I wanted to short futures actually… something I want to start trialing) but because of the last week or two of trading where every single sell off no matter how strong it is turned into a call opportunity I was very hesitant and didn’t make my move and missed a huge opportunity.

In addition the other issue especially the mornings are that we are seeing these massive $1+ moves up and down and by time we finally get confirmation of a move it has already moved so far in one direction that the move is gone. This then leaves us with the choppy and range bound movements middle of the day that also are filled with numerous reversals. 

So as you can see I again took a loss on Tesla swing which depending on how tomorrow goes will once again lock in a red week for me… I do want to talk about this trade for those of you who were in it with me. 

**Tesla Trade Review**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3xsnp6j59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=37f5614afc4b501fa057f9e49d673e4cdc1bbfdb

So I laid out the trade here on Tesla. 

This was a 2/17 190P that I entered and called out EOD Friday for a potential swing (note- some of this will be by memory so bare with me). If I took this trade over again I would have done 30dte note 14dte… 

The reason I took this trade is that we have this very large hammer candle with a hard rejection of 197.1 resistance. This 197.1 resistance is a major level that dates back to the November sell off. With the hard rejection there, overall at the same time SPY looked like it too could see a reversal it was a high probability set up. 

Somethings that worked against us here… the overall IV on Tesla was still sky high on Friday due to the previous weeks run up and that massive run up from earnings. That IV did carry over into Monday and actually despite a fairly large green open on Monday Tesla DID come back down at open and we saw breakeven…. This was our first potential exit… 

The next day was Tuesday and we once again had a doji candle and that was also a massive rejection off of 197.1 resistance. This was in my opinion a rejection candle and honestly was a high probability that we could still see a drop. Another thing that kept me in this trade was that this was the JPOW day and the fact that SPY recovered $8 EOD but Tesla never made it back to its HOD gave me false hope. If you did not exit Monday and knowing we had some DTE honestly there would not have been much of a reason to exit either. I do believe we were down about 25% eod… there also was a moment during the low of JPOWs speech where we could have exited green/ breakeven (2nd exit opportunity). 

Looking back at the daily candles here one thing that I did note but also overlooked as I was too bearish is that 190.1 support had been held two days in a row. That should have been an exit opportunity for me and factored In more strongly. 

Now Tuesday night after market close old Elon dropped the tea about a investors day on March 1st with phase 3…. So of course come Wednesday we get a big move up on Tesla. Now this is where things get a little subjective. 

So Wednesday comes and we have this huge bounce off 196 support and close out in the 200s. This honestly should have been my exit. I was eyeing 197.1 very closely all week long. This is where emotions took over logic. EOD yesterday I would have been down about 50-60% I cant remember. But that would have been a better exit than today. The biggest reason I didn’t exit and again emotions vs technical here is that SPY was showing weakness and I was recognizing the weakness in SPY and some other speculative assets would correlate to stocks like Tesla and Nvidia that have been majorly run up. 

So I obviously didn’t exit last night at market close which I should have. So then we have todays 3% green gap up on Tesla. I did exit at the first sign of pullback today at open. Lately tesla has seen a sizeable drop at open before lunching itself heavily green shortly after. 

I ended up taking a sizeable 66% loss and this turned into a large position as I did average down x1. 

The reason I want to talk about this is 1. For me its helpful to review long DTE trades like this and 2. I like to explain my thought processes to others. 

Things I learned or would do differently. My biggest struggle in trading (especially longer dte) is that I am okay weathering a -20 to -30% drawdown but as soon as I go profitable im ready to dump it. Why is that? Well 2022 is the main reason of that.. There used to be a time where you could buy even a 1-3dte call or put and as long as you waited long enough for the overall macro trend of the day you could hold that play pretty much till power hour or till the 8ema support was broken. IT legit was easy trading everyday just like this.. Now bring 2022 and we have (even today) these massive $1-2 reversals that if you attempt to weather them (and sometimes even 15-30dte are effected) you end up getting IV crushed and theta ate so badly that had you just taken your first profitable exit you would be far better off. 

So looking back at this Tesla trade I BELIEVED in the overall retrace at the time back to 178 support (when we were at 190) and when I had both of my green breakeven exits early in the week I found my self blinded by confirmation bias. Why? Well because I was looking for downside and I have finally found it. So I told myself this is one of those times where if you close now you are going to miss that 20-30% play. So I held. However, what I should have recognized (And on a play like SPY this wouldn’t happen just due to how aggressive tesla is) was that I had opportunities to mitigate my loss but I misread/ misplayed it. 

If I could do this trade over I would have held until Yesterday and I would have closed for a loss when it finally broke over 197.1 and closed. I also would have taken a 30dte put instead of a 14dte put. 

Overall this is a good lesson for trading. There is something to be said about having conviction in your trade… Take a look at SPY I has conviction that this rally was not sustainable and that the JPOW interview pump Tuesday was not going to last and that we needed a bigger pullback. Well had I played that with conviction and weathered the storm with a longer DTE such as 30dte puts I would have been highly rewarded today. 

This also is the hardest part in trading some of my longer DTE plays… there is no set stop loss on a level to level trade has. There are too many times where a longer DTE will hit -30 to -40% (if you bought enough time) before it seems profitability. With day trading (intraday) we have to be perfect (and generally are) or our stop loss takes care of that.. with longer DTE swings we are attempting to grab an overall macro play. Our times on a longer DTE play being perfect is far less likely than a day trade so we have to give it room to breath. 

Trading is a science and nothing is perfect. Everyday is a learning experience. I have said it before and I will say it again.. I ALWAYS learn more from my losses than I do my wins. 

I hope this review was helpful for you guys!"

Looks like this week just about every director that hasn't sold stock already sold shares. 

If all directors are selling this leads me to believe they might possibly issue stock to raise more cash. 

On May 26th shortly after the earning call they filed a updated S-3 that would allow them to issue $10B in stock or debt securities.

107,DD: BESI a semiconductor assembly company with 40% market share of its core market Die Attach with solid growth potential.,142,146t46w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/146t46w/dd_besi_a_semiconductor_assembly_company_with_40/,65,1686487714.0,"**INTRO**

 

Listen, I am aware that half of the people here are genuine gambling addicts, convincing themselves that 0dtes are somehow different from hitting the bookies. I also understand that the average WSB user recoils at the mere suggestion of ""long-term investing."" However, I hope to convince you that, just this once, an opportunity might lie on the Euronext instead of the NYSE, even though it may be considered a cardinal sin by many, perhaps even greater than buying and holding index funds.

**FYI:** This is my first DD POST, so please excuse the formatting and shit grammar. To clarify my position, I have been holding a significant number of shares of BESI for the past five years. Recently, I sold about half of my position to secure profits as I reassess my short and long-term thesis. 

**TL;DR:** BESI is a semiconductor stock in the Netherlands that specializes in die attach and assembly. It shows great potential for the future, with an extremely bullish long-term outlook, while possibly being bearish in the short term as we approach the earnings report on July 27th.

**What is BESI?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fm7c8owrwd5b1.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e8885b9956f125d9ae20c9a13853fe2e25a765f

To begin, let's understand what BESI actually does. BESI is a manufacturer of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment. In simpler terms, they produce machines used to make various types of chips found in your tech devices. They operate in a wide range of industries, including electronics, mobile internet, cloud servers, computing, automotive, industrial, LED, and solar energy. Mobile technology is their primary focus.

Headquartered in the Netherlands, BESI has manufacturing locations across Asia, Europe, and the US. They also plan to expand further into Vietnam, following the trend of semiconductor manufacturing shifting away from China after a decline in productivity due to COVID-19. 

BESI specializes in die attach, packaging, and plating, which are crucial aspects of semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, BESI is the leading company in the die attach market, as shown below.

[Besi has a 40&#37; market share of the Die Attach market and is their main profit maker ](https://preview.redd.it/pvkx0drtwd5b1.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d6a4a32fa895e73bdf556011e8f0ef15d78e9e9)

BESI's customers include some of the world's largest tech companies and since they have such a large market share if you look under the hood of your mobile devices, graphics cards, and hell even actually under the hood of your Car then you'll find at least some semiconductors, if not a majority, have in some part been produced via one of Besi's many Machines that they manufacture.   


(speculation warning)  
It is worth noting that in the semiconductor industry, large and important customers often deal through subcontractors to maintain secrecy and mitigate the risk of corporate espionage. During investor presentations, and actual conversations I have personally had with Besi personnel at these presentations they mention names like Apple and Nvidia, and even listed Foxconn as a subcontractor, providing further evidence to support the theory that Apple is also a customer. 

[A List of their confirmed customers as well as their subcontractors so you can speculate yourself  ](https://preview.redd.it/t0qr8d60xd5b1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f07d7f3640d4ea1e9941b6543e4ea02e211f1eac)

**MACRO**

Die attach is currently BESI's core business and primary profit driver. However, industry forecasts suggest that 2023 will be a slower year for semiconductor companies, which could result in an overall decrease in profits. Nonetheless, future projections indicate that around 2024, the next cycle of growth is expected to begin. .

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jwpmlee3xd5b1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cde187f45e18d6c2e346186e90761f1538bebf2

If you've been following developments in the semiconductor industry, you've likely come across the concept of hybrid bonding. Almost every semiconductor company is heavily investing in this technology as the next major advancement. BESI is also focusing on hybrid bonding and has started producing hybrid bonding machines. As the customer base for hybrid bonding grows, BESI can expect an increase in orders.

&#x200B;

[Besi Already starting to get into HB machine production, poised to grow signicantly if they do well](https://preview.redd.it/kixec204xd5b1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eebd3b4d2a35b038d654b76d2680ada8076fb1e6)

&#x200B;

[AMD has already started planning to incorporate HB in several of their chiplines, there is real potential for a large customer base here if BESI nails this](https://preview.redd.it/479n19o4xd5b1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=963356e04701300a0ab447e445f6bbf5dbc5c572)

 AMD, for example, has already begun planning to incorporate hybrid bonding in several of their chip lines. This presents a significant opportunity for BESI to expand its customer base. Additionally, AMD has been announcing more products that require advanced process steps and a higher number of die placements in their EPYC line of chips. This trend indicates that as chips become more advanced, companies like BESI stand to profit further.

**Their Numbers**

To start the Balance sheet numbers

Let's delve further into BESI's balance sheet numbers. As shown, BESI has captured a significant portion of the die attach market, which has been steadily growing. Although other aspects of their business have been fluctuating, they still maintain a considerable market share in the various fields they serve.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqt9nzhoxd5b1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c045ea82bf795c338671b57d39224a62a994cee9

Over the years, BESI has demonstrated solid profit efficacy and margin while remaining relatively cost-effective to run, indicating strong financial performance.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lavw0aapxd5b1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=991fcc5501c733e9dfcdb7e423fcdfcedbc0aeca

BESI boasts a substantial cash reserve that far exceeds their debt, providing them with a robust liquidity base.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxmwwr6qxd5b1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09b6e40fd69d23797acf52e37cc4e4de808258ef

Whats also important to note that this october BESI is finishing its 300 Million euro Share buyback program, They purchased \~3.5 million shares already through may-23 for € 222.1 million.

**Aren't they near ATH right now after a huge bull run?**

You might be wondering if BESI is currently trading near its all-time high (ATH) after experiencing a significant bull run. Indeed, BESI has performed remarkably well since the March 2020 crash. Just recently, the stock reached an ATH of 104 euros per share but subsequently fell to 94 euros. This drop is precisely why I am presenting this DD now, as I expect it to continue falling at least by a few euro further. Analysts also have forecasted a slowdown in semiconductor market growth for 2023, as the largest spenders in the industry reduce their total expenses. 

&#x200B;

[forecasting a slow in growth in the semiconductor market](https://preview.redd.it/56ghuewqxd5b1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2cedf5f2d50a091d7d3be542f51386039a6c81d3)

&#x200B;

 It's crucial to recognize that BESI operates as a cyclical company. Typically, the third and fourth quarters witness a surge in orders as companies manufacture new products for release. On the other hand, the first and second quarters experience a lower influx of orders. 

**My Thesis:**

Considering all the factors discussed, I anticipate that BESI will post mediocre to average earnings on July 27th, and I am even slightly bearish in the short term leading up to the earnings release. Consequently, I have adjusted my position to hold only about half of my original shares in the past few weeks. If BESI continues to decline in the coming weeks, my plan is to purchase more shares, bringing my holdings back to approximately 75% of my original position.

However, in the long term, BESI is well-positioned to continue dominating the die attach market. As semiconductor chips become more advanced, BESI stands to profit even more. Additionally, the growth of hybrid bonding and advanced placement technologies presents further opportunities. BESI already has machines in development for both areas.

I am curious to hear your thoughts on this analysis as well."

Usually  I don't include housing data even though it is important, but the  market doesn't really react much to it. I do think given the last CPI  housing and energy will be very important as they are really the last  piece of the puzzle.

That being  said the only possible play this week is we might get a spike on PPI  release, but beyond that, there isn't much data this week that the  market reacts to

The Biden-Xi  meeting is going to be extremely important even though we might not know  what comes out of it anything for a while, most of the inflation is  supply side and if china relaxes covid zero policies we can see a major  shift in inflation

The UK budget  is going to be very important too. I think Sunak has no choice but to go  in the exact opposite direction of Truss just to restore faith in the  government and the UK economy. I'll be Long GBP before the budget  announcement

# Earnings

Some commonly asked questions I get a lot:

* Earnings are lotto, lotto plays are 5% max position size for, 10% if I feeling wild. Please don't full port into earnings.
* Check  IV before buying, the best time to buy options for earnings  is at an  IV lower than 50%, that's usually not the week of earnings, so buy  further out expiries to avoid crush, or buy 1-2 weeks before earnings
* I  don't hold my earnings plays i sell at the open to get the delicious  spiked premium, and then IF the stock runs again i'll then buy some more  as an independent play

Tue 15 Nov

* Tencent & $JD - - Similar to $BABA, will make sympathy moves and earnings move will be small

# Watchlist

**- $LLY Long**  
The  idea that LLY sold off because of a tweet, is commical at best and  stupid at worst, doesnt mean we get a techincal recovery here, LLY is  approaching the 1hr 200MA, will take ATM calls to play the 21MA test,  which will be my exit, will leave runners in case it runs some more

**- $SPY Short**  
We  are very overdue for a pullback, i'll be taking a small short position  with expectations of a small pullback before the bigger run, My first  take profit target is 395 and second target at 392

**- $SPY Long**

After  the pullback is done depending on whether it holds at 392 or above , i  will take calls from there, with my Take profit at 200MA on the daily.

https://preview.redd.it/okoxoxa2luz91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23bdd14e403f36dc731a07777036995c2112eb61

**- $VIX Short**

I  expect in case we get the pullback VIX will shoot up to 24.4 resistance  level, and then on the SPY run will crash down to August levels at  19.5. Will be taking Puts at resistance

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

I'm  going to give some political analysis but please don't take this as an  endorsement or condemnation of any politician (they all suck our blood  equally)

DWAC!!! We all know that Trump promised to make a big announcement on the 15th. IF he does 99.9% is announcing his run for 2024.

We  all know that the midterm election is ongoing, and expectations were to  get a ‘’red wave’’ with the GOP controlling the Senate and House, So  far the Dems got the house and the senate is a toss-up, a lot of Trump’s  candidates didn't do so well, a big blow for his plans.

Add to that rumor that he initially delayed the announcement, to see what would happen with Nevada, and they lost.

The smart play here for Trump is to wait to see what goes on with Georgia later in December than announce right now IMO.

So  my play is DWAC puts, now this is a risky play so I'll be hedging with  some calls as well. But if the 15th comes and goes, DWAC will go back  where it came from quickly.

Alright,  so that's it for this week. I'll be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong. Remember non of this financial advice, do your own DD!

If you have any  questions let me know!

However, there is still a case that this is going to continue to push higher leading into CPI.

We are now 4 days away from CPI and while officially YoY consensus has not hit the markets yet we are seeing preliminary numbers suggesting yet another CPI/ CORE YoY beat but a very probably rebound on CPI/ CORE MoM. The question will then remain… Do markets want to and care more about the YoY decline or do they care more about a significant rebound of MoM? If you remember we got our first negative MoM reading since 2020 I believe it was and the markets STILL didn’t rally. Which honestly when you look at what has happened since CPI its quite incredible that we didn’t rally off that.

Today was your classic inside day pattern on SPY and Futures. We didn’t quite see that 415.2 resistance retested and we didn’t quite get all the way back down to key support at 408.8 that I would have liked to seen tested. 

So while we did close red today in all reality its hard to call this bearish yet. We also managed to wick down to the daily 8ema and hold that support line. With the break through of that bull channel support yesterday we have now restructured our bull channel and restructured the broken resistance line and find ourselves yet again in another break out/ break down triangle.

Key support remains at 410.9 (that means SPY has to open green and hold green all day) and key resistance remains at 415.2. 

We have not closed a candle below the daily 8ema since January 19th and we have only closed two candles below the daily 8ema since January 5th… so almost 5 weeks of trading all supported by the daily 8ema…. Still incredibly impressive strength here shown by SPY. 

From a bearish standpoint they want to see a close below 408.8 tomorrow which puts us closed below the daily 8ema and would most likely result in a test of 405.3 support. If the bulls lose that support then we start talking about a bigger drop down to 400 support. 

However, if the bulls can turn this inside day into a bullish pattern and reclaim 415.2 resistance and most importantly close over that resistance I would feel comfortable in a rally to 419.5 leading into CPI. 

Key SPY Support- 410.6 -> 408.8 -> 406.6 -> 405.3 -> 403

Key SPY Resistance- 413.2 -> 415.2 -> 416.9 -> 419.5

While its not nearly as clear on SPY as it is here on Futes we are actually seeing a potential bull flag here on the daily which would confirm that breakout rally to 419.5/ 4200+.

Now I mentioned yesterday that despite the daily 8ema support bounce/ double bottom we had to worry about that bigger double top off 4177 and that a retrace today was highly probable. My key support to watch today was 4145 and 4123. With this now being the third day in a row to touch and bounce off the daily 8ema we should be looking for a bigger move either below or under that 8ema tomorrow. 

We had a true inside day here on futes and we rejected both key resistance at 4177 and bounced off key support at 4123. We do not have a true sense of direction just yet. 

Tomorrow the bulls need a closure over 4177 and we are going to start looking at a rally to 4210+. However, the bears could secure a close below 4123 tomorrow which would open up a sell off into that 4085/4095 support area. 

As frustrating as it is both scenarios are highly probable. There is also a breakout triangle formed here on futures and it should be noted that futes never lost its original bull channel support which lies at 4105 for tomorrow and breakout resistance will be at 4175. So we will keep a close eye on those levels tomorrow. 

Key Futures Support- 4123 -> 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030

Key Futures Resistance- 4145 -> 4177 -> 4210

Tesla with an impressive feat has now closed its 7th green day in a row. It did have a notable 8 green days in a row back in March 2022, May 2013 and April 2020 it managed to put in a 10 day in a row green streak also. 

The question remains… how much does this rally have left? I restructured our blue rising wedge support line after yesterdays support bounce and today we once again lost that support but managed to find intraday strength and closed green. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rdbuz7oto1ha1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58f03ca17b887a6331a0d91c6e4a893420bd0ca3

Im not saying a well placed tweet late last night about a Master Plan 3 for Tesla for its March 1st investors day is to blame for todays strength but when SPY closes -1%+ red and everyone but Tesla closes red (nvidia closed at 0.14% green) something isn’t quite right… 

So the question remains… how much meme could a meme meme if a meme could meme? As much as a meme could meme… if a meme could meme… 

We are incredibly now closing in on the daily 200ema on Tesla which sits at 214.9. That would be another impressive 7%+ rally from todays close for Tesla to get there but it is a very real possibility unless the flood gates finally open. 

Today SPY showed true weakness for the first time in quite a long time and this time the rest of tech followed that weakness too. 

Tesla the last few days really the last week of trading besides last Friday has come out very weak with a morning sell of and by some miracle continues to find strength to push this higher. Today the bulls finally closed over 197.1 and broke through that 200 price target. 

Its pretty frustrating here because the logical choice here is 100% puts and I just keep waiting for that morning Tesla opens -4% for no reason but this thing just wont stop going up. But after a nearly 110% rally over 5-6 weeks I truly can not justify calls. 

My thoughts remain if SPY doesn’t have a breakdown into CPI retesting 400-405 and choses to rally that tesla is probably going to push for some sort of incredible blowoff top up in that 230-250 range. However, if we see a market wide sell off leading into CPI Tesla has the most to lose (next to probably nvidia). The issue now is when. 

My other thoughts remain if CPI does miss next week on Tuesday and we finally see the wind taken outta the bulls sails that Tesla and all these other memes and tech stocks who have rallied mercilessly the last 7 weeks are going to have some incredible sell offs. 

Key Tesla Support- 196.1 -> 190.2 -> 183.9

Key Tesla Resistance- 201.5 -> 204.8 -> 208.8 -> 214.9

The last piece of the puzzle that makes me believe SPY at least is going to see a more major sell off here over the next few days is the VIX. Ow I mentioned yesterday that we broke that 4 month long resistance line. However, today we actually broke yesterdays HOD for the VIX and today we closed right at that key 19.6/19.7 resistance line. 

IF the VIX continues this trend up tomorrow and especially if it turns its daily 20ema into support we could be seeing a more significant pullback on spy. 

Something to note here is the fact that the VIX closed over its daily 20ema for the first time since January 5th. 

We have not had a full candle over the daily 8ema since then and have only closed 1 candle over 19.7 since January 23rd. If the VIX continues this rally up we are going to see a bigger retrace here on SPY and my target will remain 390-400 for any significant retrace. 

We are once again finding ourselves at a crossroads here on SPY. We have the bearish pieces of the puzzle starting to form, however, for the last 7 weeks every time the bears attempted to make a move the bulls have absolutely crushed their hopes and dreams. 

Up until realistically FOMC day we were rallying on technical (talking about SPY here) and momentum but for the last week now we have been rallying on I don’t even know what. It sure feels like the algos buy button is stuck and they haven’t figured out how to unstick it yet.

Next two days do have some decent data which is jobs tomorrow. However, something to keep in mind is that JPOW despite saying he did not like how strong the labor force was did allude to him essentially not caring about jobs as much… it will actually be telling tomorrow to see how the algos react to this data. 

Friday we have UMICH sentiment which I am pretty sure has resulted in a rally almost every single Friday at 10am for the last 4+ weeks.

Today was one of those highly frustrating days where price action was so incredibly violent and all over the place that we just couldn’t get good entries, or exits. Win rate wise played today fairly well obviously but that one stop loss hunt only for SPY to drop even further after I got hunted was highly frustrating. 

The last week or two has become increasingly difficult to trade. I am finding myself missing the obvious moves on one play… as in today we hard rejected a key level I watch but by time I “believed it” the play was already up 10%+ and at that point its chasing/ fomo… and on the next play I take the obvious entry that follows every single on of my rules and end up getting stop loss hunted before the move ever comes to pay me. 

Longer DTE plays/ holds we are also at a highly frustrating time period here as we have CPI in 4 days so going long is extremely risky as we could easily see a massive dump on SPY leading into CPI like the past or we could see a highly regarded rally into CPI like September. 

The rally has lasted so long now with out any meaningful pullback OR consolidation that for me at least to continue to believe in upside here is tough. 

I do see an upside case for 420 to 430 depending on what CPI brings us but I also realize how far gone this rally on SPY has gone and especially on other tickers like Tesla/ Nvidia that I just cant quite bring myself to fully bet against it anymore. 

The market has put us in between a rock and a hard place… we have three options here… 

1. We sit cash gang (I like this option) and play intraday trends and trade lightly until technical tighten back up

2. You go long on calls and believe in the strength of the bulls and bull market and hope that you aren’t buying the literal top. 

3. You go long on puts believing that even in a true bull market stocks do not go up forever and you risk missing out on the next 5-10% move up in the markets. 

Honestly all three options have their downside. Even just trading intraday we are left with these extremely choppy and irrational days that make it nearly impossible to gain any true edge. When the price of SPY decides its going to pump $1 on a 15min candle only to immediately drop $1.5 then next candle and then rally back $1.25 the next candle its nearly impossible to lock into a trend and trade this well. 

For me until something breaks the bulls back its light trading and preserving capital for the next big move."

Based on my calculations factoring in PE, F Pe, Peg, and interaction with weekly 20ema, ATH, and the 2020 lows… NVDA is actually the most favorable short followed by Apple, AMD and MSFT. Impressively META and TSLA actually come in at the least shortable stock right now.

I think one thing that’s really mind boggling to me is the fact that APPLE is only 6% from its ATH, and the fact that AMD has a PE ratio of 394.94!!!! Also Amazon forward PE of 67.01 and Nvidia PEG of 4.04 are impressively stupid too.

The imbalance on SPY daily continues… so before we had the issue that we were trading/ closing candles over the established supply… I said that the only way to fix this was to sell off or establish a new demand… today with that EOD pump and of course a long wick to the downside… we did just that. 

With a new demand (support) at 411.59 the favoritism goes to the upside with a target of 415.56 to 417.03. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

On SPY daily we did poke through that 3 point resistance line. With that it could be an indication that we are going to push to the upside. However, if you look at the daily price action you can see we are clearly still in a range and realistically what most probably is going to happen is we continue to push these support/ resistance lines out until we finally see a sustainable breakout or breakdown. 

We are attempting and realistically establishing 411.6 as a major support area now. The major resistance still lies in that 413.4 to 414.7 area though. 

As long as SPY continues to close candles over the daily 8ema I am neutral to bullish… as I said last week I do believe it is still too early to short…

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 411.6 -> 405  
 Support- 411.6 -> 408.8  
 Resistance- 413.5 -> 414.7 -> 415.9

Futures and SPY are now back on track together with Futes also putting in a new demand (Support). With todays new demand at 4131 it actually lowers the current demand from 4134 (takes it out) to the current 4131. 

Support being established at 4131 means we start to look at the next supply (resistance) which sits at 4153 then 4190. If you remember from Friday that supply was re-confirmed (hence the dashed line instead of normal solid) which means we should look at 4153 as a major resistance area. 

It is probable that we do reject here but also the biggest thing to note is that the last 7 candles have no closed within this 4131 to 4153 range…

Price action wise with this really nice double bottom off 4131 and establishing a new demand (support) I would definitely look for the upside here.. it should be noted that we still have not broken through that blue resistance line which has 4 touches on it… that resistance sits at 4155 for tomorrow and that is what we will call our line in our sand…

A wick through 4155 but more importantly a closure OVER 4153 tomorrow would indicate the potential for a bigger move up to that 4190 to 4198 area. 

However, if we truly are range bound there actually is a high probability that we reject tomorrow with a double top off 4150 and close somewhere near 4130-4135. IF this happens we actually are likely to see a new supply (resistance) established below 4153. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4153 -> 4190  
 Demand- 4131 -> 4074  
 Support- 4131 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4153 -> 4180

Interestingly enough… the VIX actually closed green today AND SPY closed green… actually even more interestingly is that the VIX closed a 0.29%+ and futures closed at exactly 0.29%+… I actually do not know if I have ever seen that happen before…

The VIX this morning was up about 3-4% before it finally started to sell off… it attempted to break through that 17.72 resistance level, however, once again failed and ended up coming back to that key 17.1 support area. 

The VIX continues to be sandwiched in that 16.79 to 17.72 area with the mean reversion being to 17.1 area.

While these extremely tight ranges… where spy closes within a 30-50 cent range for 2 hours or more… are extremely annoying and I would much rather play a bigger range, I have truly finally been able to capitalize on these movements. 

The one thing that I will always love about SPY is that it is predictable, chartable, and tradeable in all conditions… 2022 challenged me to be a better trader and to adapt to the ever changing market and volatility… so far in 2023 we are now learning how to be better range traders… 2022 and 2023 have been learning experiences that any of us who survive will use as tools to be better traders and prosper for the rest of our trading careers."

Overall the minutes honestly outside of the fact that a few members wanted a 50bps (which we knew) the minutes were as expected slightly dovish… however, this meeting if you remember is prior to strong jobs numbers, PPI and CPI numbers. I do think we are setting up for a more hawkish tone come next FOMC… depending on what march CPI brings… biggest takes for me is that some members would have voted for 50bps and the tight job market could cause higher and prolonged inflation…

Taking a look at SPY daily here we have so far quite the bearish movement. We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go. 

The most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound. 

Key SPY Support- 398.5 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 394.4 

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.1 -> 405.3

Same story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now… and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now. 

Futures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema. We also officially have a 8/ 20ema bearish crossover here too. 

Futures key support- 4000 -> 3985 -> 3965 -> 3945

Futures Key Resistance- 4030 -> 4055

Tesla announced today that its engineering HQ would be in California… short and sweet to the point announcement. 

The biggest thing to note here is that black breakout/ down triangle was officially broke to the downside today. Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so. 

Tesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though. 

Key Tesla Support- 197.4 -> 191.8 -> 183.5

The VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day… historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the “fear” leaves the market and there is very little left to fear… however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go. 

Tonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405… however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted.

Actually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season. That is a fairly impressive report. Nvidia is now testing on the weekly time frame that 215.6 to 230.9 levels.. it has seen two massive rejections up in this level so it will be quite interesting to see what Nvidia does not only tomorrow but Friday.

Overall had a pretty great trading day today.. had some 30-60dte puts that I did close today for some nice wins but also had a few l2l plays intraday. 

Today was tough to trade because we ended up having such aggressive and wild moves price action wise and premium wise it was very difficult to get into some plays… I probably missed at least 6 plays today that woulda been easy 5-10% wins simply because premiums moved so fast I never got filled and by that time it was chasing. No complaints from today for a fed day with elevated IV. 

I remain bearish till we either break back through 405 OR we reach 390… we are currently closed to 390 but I don’t suspect we will reach either by Friday EOD."

In my assessment, this lackluster performance is largely due to the prevailing economic downturn and the company's excessive stock-based compensation scheme for employees, which has spurred institutional investors to withdraw their support.

Don’t buy it for a meme bounce. Don’t be a degenerate.  The company does not want or need your money creating volatility as you swing in and out of the stock. Stay away and waste your time on other stocks. 

But if you are a long term investor looking to make a long term investment you should buy it at these bombed out prices because BB has a legitimate opportunity to be a leading IoT cybersecurity platform. 

BB remains a deeply under appreciated and misunderstood business and a lot has changed in the last 2 years. Most importantly fundamentals have never been better. BB has emerged as the undisputed leader in critical safety certified auto software and every mayor car OEM and tier 1 auto supplier including qualcomm nvidia and google has committed to working with BB to embed QNX as a foundational layer of next gen vehicles. 

Since two years ago BB qnX has continued to clean up auto design win after design win. In the last few months the company has broken all time internal records for new business. All of these design wins mean:

1) secure near term revenue - BB gets paid for embedding their engineers inside the OEMs in the preproduction phase. These revenues are contractually secure and the OEMs are dependent on BBs engineers to make sure everything is working. 

2) royalty revenues kick in FY 2024 (which starts in spring and the ramp up in FY2025 as the new OEM models (loaded with QNX) start rolling off the lot. These royalties are pure profit. Gross Margins are close to 100 percent because there are no COGS associated with them. All that cash drops to the bottom line. Rough math. Assuming 20mm cars per year x $15 per car = $300mm contribution to cash flow. But note that some advanced models may have up to $20 of revenues per car and I think it is possible that cars per year with QNX inside could be more than 20mm given just how universally adopted QNX has become in US EU and China. 

What is fascinating is that QNX is not just being adopted in cars. There is also the GEM market which is everything non auto. Historically BB had wins here and there in medical or industrial but now we are seeing defence (navy) design wins for planes and drones and smart city infrastructure wins. Imagine charging stations with QNX. 

BB gave the street long term revenue guidance last year. Investors have no reason to believe the guidance will
Be revised imminently but knowing how CEO Chen operates it is fair to assume that the guidance given was and remains conservative because BB has had no reason to overpromise. Chen prefers to underpromise so he can surprise on upside and build some leeway into the offical targets that wallstreet sets for the company. But long story short even if we accept guidance at face value BB IoT revenues have locked in target for 20 percent growth and will play meaningful role in hitting $1bn targets. 

But there is more going on in IoT. IVY has just won its first design win. Basically Pateo and Bosch are preinstalling IVY on every digital cockpit they are selling to OEMs so BB has a built in distribution and sales infrastructure in place via these tier 1 auto suppliers. This means if pateo and bosch win orders for their digital cockpits then BB automatically grows its IVY userbase. Dongfeng is the first Pateo customer but there will
Be others in the china market who will buy their
Hardware from pateo. In US and Eu lets say Mercedes or BMW chooses Bosch as its cockpit supplier then IVY will be preinstalled for those OEMs. The revenues from IVY will be slow and gradual but this is pure gravy. Any announcement from OEMs that they are committing to IVY (either via Bosch or Pateo) is extra cherry on top.
Any new IVY design wins from tier 1 auto parts makers like qualcomm or NVdia who are developing their own cockpit means that they too will preinstall
IVY in their hardware means extra distribution.

Now lets talk about cybersecurity. The business stalled this past year no way around that. Growth paused due to customer turnover as smaller clients got lured away by cheaper bundled product offerings. but BB is guiding that the worst is over. It has refreshed its own product offering and will go head to head with both legacy and new competitors. The govt and big financial institution in the meantime remains robust and offers crossselling opportunities for BB. 

What could really be extra and new revenue is if the car OEMs (the one already buying QNX) agree to add cylance to their purchase list. There is growing concern that cars are going to become targets for hackers so inevitably cars will need cylance endpoint protection and BB is right there to provide that. BB posted a cryptic CES update last week saying that cylance for cars was the next chapter in the BB story (basically the convergence of IoT and cyber) so lets stay tuned. But rough math imagine 20mm cars for starters paying $5 per year in cylance subscription thats $100mm in annual cyber subscription fees with high gross margins. 

So put it all together. You have an IoT business growing cAGR 20 percent. You have a cybersecurity business growing 10 percent but there are some exciting opportunities to accelerate that as iot and cyber converge. Meanwhile the stock has a $2bn market cap with $350mm cash + $400mm patent sale cash infusion. Pay off the debentures of $350mm and you have nice cash cushion left to fund revenue turnaround to $1bn annually. 

Near term catalysts:
1) patent sale
2) more qnx design wins in auto and gEM
3) backlog update (the current figure is outdated)
4) cylance ARR growth
5) more details on how cylance can be deployed to secure cars

Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row… This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. 

SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven’t felt “capitulation” or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. 

CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the “worst week of the year for stocks” with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently… and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with… I wonder how this week is going to finish out. 

&#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. 

The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn’t just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row… I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. 

Support- 362.1 -> 360.2 (red support) -> 358.2 (blue support) -> 355.4 -> 352.3

Resistance- 364.3 -> 365.6 (red resistance) -> 368.2 -> 370.6 -> 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill)

Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. 

Key support- 3635 -> 3615 (blue support) -> 3590 -> 3545

Key resistance- 3670 -> 3706 (blue resistance) -> 3770

Looking at apple this morning once again… which has been trend for the last week… we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. 

I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. 

The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven’t hit capitulation and we haven’t been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish… this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. 

Key supports- 150.7 -> 149.3 -> 147.1

Key resistance- 152.4 -> 154.5

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a983dfb97955545ee5142b83d1273fc2983985ea

Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. 

Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. 

Support- 270.3 -> 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) 

Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -> 292

Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading… it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50… I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.

I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven’t really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. 

The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 

10% challenge-

You know honestly not my best day today… I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. 

From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. 

This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being “smarter” than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. 

I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don’t know where to go from here… but that’s why when in doubt we don’t swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. 

Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

The gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it ""takes it out"" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn’t quite playing out yet… it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uq0mqvvcqela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce14a8e43717623fd24278596669c5fbf001cfe

The issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxsr3cedqela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09c69e16d3b302d796351150fcf416db30674766

However, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.

The next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.

Same thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...

So what REALLY needs to happen to ""balance"" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.

So what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now… in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise.

If you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic… So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market…

Oddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. 

Where does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce?

On SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. 

If we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. 

On SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. 

Supply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don’t need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. 

On a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. 

Bulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. 

With this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. 

There is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow… which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. 

Supply- 396.5 -> 414.13 

Demand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7

Key SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6

Taking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. 

With a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. 

If bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. 

On the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. 

My thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. 

From a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015

Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020

**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault… I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn’t something I plan to trade anymore.

Taking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. 

I do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. 

Next week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today.

Overall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. 

Today I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. 

Unfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. 

Looking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD…) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. 

Would I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that’s alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day."

Taking a look at the daily here I suspected that we would after failing to do so yesterday come down and touch this 405.3 support. Now I did fully expect this to continue lower into that 400-402 area today. However, incredibly we actually saw a ton of strength off that 405.3 today and I dare say that Monday this is likely to see a close back between 410.6 to 414.4 leading into CPI. CPI will absolutely be the deciding factor of 430 or 390 next. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4hbxolsamfha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6398b7a75ea8c86213121edd695ebbb395ba0a68

A few interesting things to note here on the weekly. We have that range bound red channel I have been talking about that we did actually lose support of this week and did close below. Now we also broke the 7 week long bull channel support also. Those two things there do show that this rally is quickly losing steam. However, IF we were to see a good CPI print that could trump that technical. 

IF there was no CPI next week I would feel highly confident in 30-60dte SPY puts back to 390-400 support area. However, as I have said there is no reason to be long or short on SPY until CPI is over with. 

Now something else to note and I believe I started talking about this back in December is that the 7th week post JPM collar roll generally speaking is the top of that current trend and then from weeks 7 to 11 we see a relief one way or the other. That would mean next week very well could be the top of the market cycle here and we could see a relief drop back to that 390-400 support area. WE could do that and still actually remain bullish overall. 

As long as markets hold 390and we don’t get extremely negative catalysts then I would remain bullish overall. However for me to go long again and feel confident in a longer dte 30-60dte play I really need to see a pullback to at least 400 to make the risk to reward worthwhile. 

There is not much to say this week just because CPI is likely to be a wild card and a big move up or down and the resulting days are likely to do the same. Until the weekly candle settles next Friday we don’t know what to expect next. Next Friday we will have a much clearer picture of a push to 430 or a drop to 390. 

Key Weekly SPY Support- 398.4 -> 390

Key Weekly SPY Resistance- 408.8 -> 417-> 427.5

Based strictly off the futures daily candle I actually am very bullish (when factoring in the VIX too) for Monday. I really do expect this daily 20ema support retest and 4085/4095 support test to turn into a very bullish situation for markets Monday. I expect us to close out somewhere in that 4130-4145 area. 

This is a really nice daily reversal doji candle. I will not be surprised to see a push up Monday. Bulls defending this 4095 area was a very big deal. 

&#x200B;

Slightly different structure here on futures weekly. We actually Did hold the weekly 8 week long bull channel support. WE did not break through that which overall send a bit more of a bullish picture. Plus we are closing over the critical 4095 support level (presumptively) here on futures). Bulls defending this 4095 level is a really big deal. 

Again not much to say here until we get through CPI next week and see where we end up. 

Key Futures Weekly Support- 4095 -> 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970

Key Futures Weekly Resistance- 4150 -> 4220

What truly is incredible… Tesla and nvidia both closed extremely red today. Kinda ironic that the last 2 weeks of SPY struggling at times with Tesla straight ripping it finally took a huge hit today. 

However, as crazy as it sounds and with absolutely zero chance of me playing it… the daily chart is bullish…

So yes we Did break the rising wedge support (again). However, we came down and had a huge bounce off the daily 8ema and also retook that key 196.9 area. This looks like it could definitely turn into a more bullish movement on tesla for Monday. Again CPI is Tuesday and that could very well be a market mover so no reason to trade this or speculate past Monday.

Now on the otherhand… Tesla Weekly chart is 100% bearish… of course this is where short term vs. long term differs… 

So we had a huge push up and a massive rejection up in the 200s and then closed back under 200. 

The weekly candle structure is a very large gravestone doji reversal candle… Actually similar in setup to what we saw yesterday on the daily structure (minus the gap up). 

We also closed over the weekly 200ema for the first time since beginning of November. However if you look back to that November time period you can see that much like the daily 200ema on stocks there is not usually a straight break through the 200ema. We could definitely see a pullback on Tesla next week to that 180 support area. 

Key Weekly Tesla Support- 189.9 -> 178.4 -> 167.7

Key Weekly Tesla Resistance- 197.4 -> 208.4 -> 228.5

Classic VIX here.. so we had a two day pretty large 11% total pump on the VIX. However, after another massive opening and push to 21.94 (the highest level since January 10th) the VIX unwound all day long and ended up closing a massive evening doji star reversal pattern. 

Now I have said this before… when SPY and VIX have opposing patterns (in congruence of the same thing) there is a very high probability of a play panning out for us. I did recommend swinging SPY calls however, I decided to sit cash. The only reason I didn’t take calls here is that with CPI on Tuesday we could absolutely get a huge rogue spike on the VIX. 

The risk to reward for calls is there but I don’t put it past the markets to suddenly care again over the weekend. 

Remember cash is a position… If it wasn’t for CPI I would have 100% taken them.

Overall this was such a blah week. Pre FOMC/ CPI weeks are also so tough because we have premiums so incredibly high on all 3-8dte that you need such a bigger move than usual just to see profits. Most of this week the profits I got would have been double if premiums/ IV were not so elevated. 

Also got burnt a few times playing the wrong bias. Overall was able to savage the week with some extreme confident larger than normal swing trades for today that played out well. 

Overall not my best week… not my worst week…

I really look forward to CPI being over with and being able to trade this well again.

The company's shares fell 9.5% in trading after the bell.

""We stumbled, right, we lost share, we lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year,"" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call. He said Intel has been losing market share in the data center market, a nod at the strength of rival Advanced Micro Devices.

Two of Intel's most important markets are showing weakness after two years of strong growth as remote work boomed during the pandemic. Now, the PC industry is struggling with a glut of chips after demand for consumer electronics fell off a cliff and business customers wary of a recession are slowing spending on data centers.

Gelsinger told Reuters that customers also were emptying inventory.

""We expect some of the largest inventory corrections literally that we've ever seen in the industry taking place that's affecting the Q1 guide in a meaningful way,"" he said.

""Everything hinges on the PC market recovery. AMD isn’t immune to this either,"" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Don’t think we’ve seen the bottom for INTC...They are not running a sustainable business model.""

Intel expects profit margins to fall further after dropping from 58.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 43.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. ""Its safe to say that ambitions to return to a 60% margin in the future is light years away,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

Intel reiterated its medium-term goal of 51-53% gross margin, and 54-58% longer term.

Shares of other microchip companies fell as well, with AMD down 2.6% and Nvidia Corp down 2%.

PC shipments fell 16.5% to 292.3 million units in 2022, per data from research firm IDC, forcing chipmakers to cut back production and slash revenue forecasts.

Shrinking PC demand also **pressured** Microsoft Corp's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, devices and search revenue, leading to a 19% drop in the segment in its second quarter.

Meanwhile, the data center market has also slowed from double-digit growth as businesses cut costs to ride out an economic slowdown.

After Gelsinger returned to the company nearly two years ago, Intel has focused on regaining the lead in chipmaking technology. Outsourcing the chipmaking process has helped rivals like AMD make much smaller and faster chips and outpace Intel's technology.

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $13.93 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share versus expectations of a 24 cents per share profit.

Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 32% to $14 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $14.46 billion.

Source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-expectations-2023-01-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-expectations-2023-01-26/)

Intel, Corp (INTC) is currently down 10% in the premarket trading after reporting its 4th quarter earnings that showed significant declines in the company’s sales, profit, gross margin, and outlook, both for the quarter and the full year. How much further do you think INTC will fall?"

Will this continue or will we see an upside push? 

One interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal.

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it… tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish in nature. 

I would suspect with this movement especially with the rejection and closure back under the daily 100ema today that we should continue to see a push down until we either establish a new demand or we bounce off 388.66 demand. We interestingly enough still have a very old supply level at 383.81 that has not been taken out yet. We could see a large push or large flash crash there eventually (think CPI or FOMC) to take that out before we go back up. 

Again I remain bearish overall until SPY closes over 400.6 and now until we close and HOLD over 396.36. 

The biggest bullish case here is that we establish a new demand in this 390 to 394 area over the next 2 days and that could set us up for a bigger push back to that 400.6 demand which would get us a daily 8, 20 and 200ema retest. From there though I still would suspect downside unless we are able to hold up there. WE also today turned Fridays 395.4 support level into resistance today which again just further confirms downside. 

I would actually like to be in some 14dte puts on SPY but the issue is that premiums are getting theta ate and chopped up with this high IV and these massive moves up before it finally retraces.

I again remain far more bearish on futures than I do on SPY itself. What we have here yet again is a daily 8 and 100ema rejection on Futes. One thing to note here too is that we had established a demand at 3975… broke over it… established a new supply the very next day… and then now we have rejected that supply level and lost/ closed under that demand. Which again as you can imagine is bearish in nature. 

The next bigger demand here to keep an eye on is 3915. Similarly with Spy until we realistically can close and hold a candle over 4020 supply I am not bullish on SPY and with futures also in extreme bear momentum we should look for upside pushes to sell the rip. We of course can play and does appear to be happening everyday the LOD bounces to retest resistance before falling lower. However, the risk to reward is low for such plays. 

Despite almost every day being a tight $3-$4 choppy annoying range… at some point we are going to get a bigger breakout move and I will not risk being on either side of that. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020

Demand- 3975 -> 3915

Key Futures Support- 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920 

Key Futures Resistance- 3968 -> 3975 -> 3990

Tesla is sitting in no mans land. I actually almost took some calls on it because of investor day tonight (its going on right now and let me tell you it’s a snooze fest)…. Speculation remains that a new model will be released here that is about 25k-30k… lets see if that happens. 

From a technical stand point we are stuck between 194.25/ 196.3 demand and 207.7/214.23 supply. Essentially there is no play until we either establish a new supply below the current 207.7 one which would indicate the ceiling is get lower and we could look for a retest of 194-196 and possibly lower, or we get a new demand above 196.3 which would confirm that $2 range as massive support and that would push us back to that 207-214 range. Until that happens there is zero play. 

Interestingly enough looking at the last tesla investors day it had an 6%+ drop the following day… 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75  
 Demand- 196.29 -> 194.25

Key Tesla Support- 202.8 -> 201 -> 197.8 -> 196.3 -> 194.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 206.3 -> 207.7 -> 210.8 -> 214.2

Interestingly enough the VIX did not break down today but it did close a red day while SPY also closed a red day which is definitely not the normal way this market works. The VIX held the 20ema support here but did reject the daily 8ema. 

One interesting thing to note is that the last time the VIX was in this area was February 17th… SPY had a LOD of 404.05 and a HOD of 407.51 that day. Currently with the VIX at the same level our LOD was 393.38 and HOD was 396.69.

What is the main point… despite “fear” not spiking we are seeing a market retracement.

I just realized I made a ton of trades today. I made 10 intraday trades (also closed 4 different longs) today vs. 6-7 trades/ day that I have been averaging. 

I had opened a slew of 30dte puts on Friday and pretty much Monday immediately regretted it. I thankfully was able to exit all but AMD and Nvidia today for profits but my bags were pretty heavy most of this week. The most frustrating thing was how these stocks would move up and down the way they did. 

Actually the most frustrating and kinda fascinating thing is that despite most of the stocks I was holding have decent drops over night/ intraday they did not gain as much value as I anticipated that they would. My SPY puts were the most frustrating. They closed ITM at about 6% red… and with the morning opening and a 0.3%+ drop I had only gone from -6% to -3%... I have no idea what was going on with that. I ended up holding until the 2nd drop and then felt like I was winning just being able to exit. 

MSFT was the same was too… closed down about 10-12% and with a -1% drop I had barely seen breakeven. Didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Something else that is funky this whole week is that the intraweek contracts so 3/2 and 3/3 spy options IV is extremely elevated. It goes from 3/3 puts having a 20% IV to the 5dte 3/6 puts having an IV of 15%. I noticed it earlier in the week and we still haven’t seen IV come down. Its like the week is pricing in a huge movement but its not happening. 

Overall though a good day of trading despite all the chop we had. Really only the bad part of the day was getting burnt in a call around 145pm that appeared to have a nice bounce coming up. Only to break a key demand so I exited early. I jumped into a put for the downside move and ended up getting stopped out on that big 2pm doji candle and then the next candle proceeded to dump. 

Outside of that this has been a pretty good week of trading."

Tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data… consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE… with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. 

The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all… however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump.

The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. 

Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. 

However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? 

My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. 

IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. 

Key SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3

Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. 

The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. 

The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. 

Key Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures resistance- 4030 -> 4055 -> 4085

Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now… As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn’t expect a bigger sell off… yet… The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. 

Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3

The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn’t give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.

Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn’t work out. 

Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe… to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn’t be expected… Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. 

I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. 

Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405."

# TL;DR

I'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:

1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.
2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**
3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble.
4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone.
5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.
6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do.
7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)

You see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.

# 3. Chips

Not sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.

# 4, 5, and 6.

The remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.  There is a saturated online market for apple products that apple will not see any revenue from."

Gather round the campfire returds, 
🪵 🔥 

Ye who would hear a tale of the market's ebb and flows, heed my words and listen well. For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.

Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious
mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.

""The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground"".
""Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?""
“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted"".

Wherever he went , ""off colour"" remarks were expressed.

At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz"".
At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: ""This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and
 FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro"".
At his wedding to Burry: ""I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis"".

In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.
He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, ""The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate"". In it, he was quoted as saying ""bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully"".

Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.
He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter
dismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.
He eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted ""THIS ISNT FAIR"", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, ""Honey, your salmon
is here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and [knew of their fate](https://ibb.co/xmXSZjc).

Alas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.
And I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.

https://preview.redd.it/m0d8s7zbpn0b1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4744071f5ed7ca45f9886a5d4e00385e783d951a

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)

**The A100 is the market leader because it has ASIC cores that accelerate the major ML libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**

* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.
* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.

https://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299

* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change
* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.
* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.
* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.
* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.

This is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**

Then why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:

* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.
* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.
* The ""IT"" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?

Why $700 next year:

* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year
* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time
* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.

**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below. My plan is to hold for one year.**

SPY welcomed us today with the red and green. Another excruciatingly boring day after the first hour. A total lack of volume, follow through and overall technical support to moves. 

I saw this chart posted the other day and thought it was very interesting. I plan to at the EOY probably over new years 3 day weekend do a 2023 projection for big tech and SPY with where we possibly could go. But this chart shows that despite Tesla seemingly being the “easy” short that Apple, Msft and Google (maybe Adobe) are the best shorts.

Here we have the prices as of today 12/27 of optimized extreme bear plays for June 2023 for those above tickers. I plan to reference back to these throughout the year. I want to wait personally until the week of January 9th to open any long plays. For me I still believe that Apple, Msft, and Google are the best play. However, I honestly worry about how strong MSFT is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown.   
 

If I had to pick right now I would get SPY, Apple, Google and maybe Amazon puts. Netflix, adbe, nvidia are just too price already. And despite the probable Tesla downfall I wouldn’t buy it without some sort of 20-30% relief bounce first.

Well SPY continues to be hella frustrating… Last week I mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360-370. However, as you can see put in some really strong support at that 379.6 area and we have not been able to break that down. With that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on Friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386-390 today. Even looking at futures overnight which were up 0.7% at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today. 

However, we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn’t quite break through. Taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 379.6 to 386.3. however, when we look at the last 5 trading days besides December 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 379.6. Todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too. Depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern (bearish pattern). 

I have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before. This is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get (futes has it too). The way I see it that we either open over the blue support line of 382.2 (+0.2%) or we open under the red resistance line of 380.4 (-0.3%). I expect tomorrow to (and overnight) to establish the next 2-3 day move on SPY. 

If we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 370.6 by EOW Friday. 

If we breakout through the red resistance line (and more importantly the daily 8ema) then I will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by EOW.

Taking a look at Futures we are in the exact same pattern as SPY daily. This nice big diamond pattern here. With this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern. Key resistance of this pattern is 3872.  

I am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845. We have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now. It is a very strong support area. If we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn. 3805 is the next major support. 

Resistance is at 3880 and 3920.

Tesla is just full on capitulating at this point. I cant believe that it dropped almost 12% intraday today. 

Tesla has dropped 45.6% in 17 trading days… Absolutely impressive.

With tesla losing 111.4 weekly support. Next major levels I have are 94.4 and 60.7. Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.

I really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla… buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation.

The VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. 

There are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. 

Market wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow.

Tough day to trade but was able to get in and out of some plays quickly and play some nice l2l. Overall not a great day but a green day at least."

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.

While the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.

**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**

Before we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.

Let's get into it!

Nvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.

To begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.

In the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.

Previously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.

NVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.

Fibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.

Let's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:

1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67
2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \* 1.618 = 464.02
3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15

However, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.

In summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.

During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94

&#x200B;

**So, where do we stand?**

Nvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:

&#x200B;

**Bear Scenario:**

While we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.

One notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.

These are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.

&#x200B;

**Bull Scenario:**

On the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.

For perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.

As NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it’s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.

&#x200B;

**Realistic Scenario:**

Based on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.

While it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.

In conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

&#x200B;

It's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!"

Me : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc”

&#x200B;

Me : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is  gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%.

Investors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ”

&#x200B;

Me : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that.  But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio.

Investors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment”

&#x200B;

Me : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis”

Investors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character”

&#x200B;

Me : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical”

Investors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before”

&#x200B;

Me : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. 

Trader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too”

&#x200B;

Me : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ?

Me : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data.

So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones.

I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “

**Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street :**

 

https://preview.redd.it/nqebgpdgnfm91.jpg?width=852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51e31cb24704ae04befed65886ef005c9facc194

&#x200B;

Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street.

**1.** ***Johnny Wall Street***  


If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex.

My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short.

&#x200B;

**2.** ***Lax Boy***  
This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss.

&#x200B;

***3. The Bionic Woman***  
I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks.

&#x200B;

***4. The Guy without a GPS***  
He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends.

&#x200B;

***5. The Crusty Old Dude***  
Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted.

&#x200B;

***6. Somebody's Sister***  
She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake.

&#x200B;

***7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy***  
He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil?

&#x200B;

***8. The Husband Hunter***  
This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.)

&#x200B;

***9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child***  
He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him.

&#x200B;

***10. Austin Powers***  
He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him.

&#x200B;

***11. I'm Doing God's Work Man***  
He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day.

&#x200B;

***12.*** ***The Unusual Suspect***  
He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train.

&#x200B;

    Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe.
    

&#x200B;

**Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ?** 

 ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift )

&#x200B;

Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. 

&#x200B;

It is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? )

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**1.** ***Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy :*** 

&#x200B;

[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/s751y2wtnfm91.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a54e9cfc7538024ef8ed217b03571f27914cca5a)

[QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/zi07hbwtnfm91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beee6dee598d7a34a832b54dd99a45ede08cd360)

Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife )

&#x200B;

So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say

SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339

QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***2. HF’s and institutions trading strategy :*** 

&#x200B;

[sp500Candles\(\) : This function is being followed right now](https://preview.redd.it/b87waz0gqfm91.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d478a9e20f9c4861cc3a2c56709f18bed7bda4e)

[nasdaqCompositeCandles \(\) : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event.](https://preview.redd.it/ibezj21gqfm91.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85d0ffc0cc203e3c901283090fa03ba022c2e09a)

&#x200B;

So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details

&#x200B;

*USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only )*

&#x200B;

String Powell = “ “;  // Current status : Himself

Int u = x; ( x = current cpi )

If ( Powell = “Himself” ){

copytrade(sp500Candles() );    // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week  ( Most likely )

} 

else if ( Powell = “Volcker” ){

copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () );    // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. 

} 

else if ( Powell = “ArthurBurns”){

if( u < 8.6 ) 

{

NasdaqUp( );     // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation )

SpxUp( );

} 

else {

NasdaqDown( );   // 1970-71 times  ( Reinflation )

SpxDown( );

}

}

&#x200B;

Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3.** ***Cheaters trading strategy : Let’s cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles();***

&#x200B;

[Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles\(\) on weekly time frame](https://preview.redd.it/qr5vbkvtnfm91.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=233727ba5c44ded087e6b1a190d4441c8ae93a66)

I don’t wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters.

Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD

&#x200B;

Buy zones :

Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week.

And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :)

Sell zones :

Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week.

&#x200B;

Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have.

&#x200B;

***4. Illuminati trading strategy :*** 

( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 )

&#x200B;

So as you all know my  brother Itachi wrote “Stock market is about to collapse in 47days” and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will.

&#x200B;

Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page.

&#x200B;

\- 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor )

&#x200B;

[2008 vs 2001](https://preview.redd.it/58ilkne9rfm91.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a8f45ccddcf3342b750bacbe77013a13c294dd9a)

\- 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september.

\- 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september.

&#x200B;

[1994](https://preview.redd.it/xe44p70drfm91.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b576f05a0c0c8410f201356524c2e84c486bbaa)

\- 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on )

&#x200B;

[1987 vs 1980](https://preview.redd.it/ud1nv1aerfm91.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e696894cf494f2f5b2fc4abdb796db45a6b27a0)

\- 1987 : Black Monday crash 

\- 1980 : Volcker crash

&#x200B;

[1973 vs 1966](https://preview.redd.it/u7ffr5afrfm91.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1df04e990cbdb7967d002189ede95268250f7d10)

\- 1973 : Arthur got burned

\- 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war.

&#x200B;

Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :)

&#x200B;

**Note :** I have discounted the **""Noob level strategy""** by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Result :**

*How to use this info ?* 

We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before.

&#x200B;

Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc  sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share.

&#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : Fed Fomc sept 20.

and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week

&#x200B;

***2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward )***

 ***I love this strategy***

&#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen )

and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week.

&#x200B;

***3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward )***

&#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens )

not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers.

&#x200B;

Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others.

&#x200B;

**Risk of September 2022 :**

* Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears.

* Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell

&#x200B;

* Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets.

&#x200B;

* Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666.

* September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23.

&#x200B;

*  Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before.

**May 27th Recap**

The stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.

This positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.

As a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.

# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day

As the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.

The day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.

At 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.

Lastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.

# SPY Technical Outlook

TLDR (u/[**farmtechy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmtechy/)**)** 

This analysis, viewed through the lens of both 4-hour and 1-hour charts, maintains a bullish bias. The 4-hour chart anticipates a swing low aligned with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG) alongside a significant equilibrium at 415.39. On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.

**H4 Chart**

https://preview.redd.it/j8q2znkirk2b1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4bf8fd84f3f079fc79b6c258f5512bd0fb81780

Bias: In the context of the 4-hour chart, the present market analysis leans towards a bullish inclination, predicting a swing low on the H4 chart that aligns with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG). Additionally, a notable balance point is observed at the level of 415.39.

**Critical Levels to Monitor**

Bearish Order Block: 420.89 - 419.62 *(resistance), 431.73 - 428.15 (upside target)*

Bias: In the context of the 1-hour chart, the current market analysis exhibits a bullish tendency, forecasting a potential swing low. The focus is primarily on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) spanning from 415.90 to 416.88 and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB) from 414.75 to 413.85. These zones fall within the current dealer range's discount zone, notably below the halfway mark of 417.38.

**Critical Levels to Monitor**

0%: 420.89

50%: 417.38

100%: 413.87

Change of Character: 419.05 *(Candle close below this level and look for FVGs and order block as downside targets)*

This week, the US stock market took a big hit, with its worst drop since March. The reason? Investors are getting jittery, thinking central banks might bump interest rates to keep inflation in check. People are also buying up bonds, thinking that if the banks tighten the purse strings too much, the economy could fall into a tailspin.

The S&P 500, a barometer of the US stock market, lost 1.4% this week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.3%. Folks cashed in on big tech stocks that had been doing well. Companies like Marvell Technology and GlobalFoundries didn't have the best time, and even giants like Microsoft and Nvidia took a hit.

What’s more, the hot streak in stocks that thrive on growth, especially ones in artificial intelligence, is starting to cool off. Investors are biting their nails as interest rate increases seem to be on the horizon. They’re also worried we haven't yet felt the full blow of what these central bank moves might mean for the economy.

To add a bit of rain on the parade, Jerome Powell, the head honcho of the Federal Reserve, hinted that interest rates might go up not once but possibly twice in 2023. However, some of his colleagues aren't rushing to make changes. For example, Raphael Bostic from the Atlanta Federal Reserve said he's cool staying as they are for the rest of this year and even into the next.

# H4

The Short-term is still bearish as we made a lower low, but we are approaching the daily bullish order block between 431.99 and 428.87. This zone could be a turning point, especially the H1 order block from 431.00 to 430.18, which is ideal for a more refined point for a reversal. If a reversal occurs, we would aim for the gap between 434.98 and 436.19.

Additional higher targets would be the 438.73 - 439.58 gap and the 443.90 peak, leaving runners for new highs.

If we dip below the 431.99 - 428.87 order block, our eyes should shift to the imbalance between 424.25 and 426.94 that previously acted as support and was only partially balanced.

There's also an imbalance from 419.34 to 420.87 and another daily bullish order block from 419.22 to 416.22, considered significant support.

Dealing Range:

* 0%: 443.90
* 50%: 430.06
* 100%: 416.22

Bullish Blocks:

* 428.87 - 431.99 (D)
* 419.22 - 416.22 (D)

The Fed has two tools to address inflation - rate hikes and quantitative tightening (QT).  I'm guessing 50% of regards understand rate hikes, but not QT.  I'll skip the details; basically QT also raises interest rates, but the strength of the affect isn't well understood.

The Fed said it would raise rates and deploy QT on a fixed schedule.  One Fed official said the QT schedule would be like watching paint dry.  They did this to prevent another taper tantrum, aka stocks only go up.  Fed studies have shown QT (and the opposite version quantitative easing) have a greater effect on the stock market than the economy.  Meanwhile, interest rate hikes, and inflation, hurts the poors more than the market.  So, the Fed could have decreased it's balance sheet through QT more, but since that hurts the market, they chose lingering inflation with interest rate hikes.

The proof is the SVB collapse.  The Feds balance sheet peaked at just under 9 trillion in 2022.  QT started and it got down to 8.3 trillion in March 2023, then SVB happened and quantitative easing (QE) was back on the menu.  The balance sheet increased to 8.7 trillion.  God save the Market.  Better yet, Fed save the Market.

The Fed should be trying to reduce its balance sheet since QT and QE aren't well understood and a big balance sheet has risks, but every Fed president is a permabull and a secret member of WSB.  I'd buy calls that JPow is watermelon fucker - he was seen at a Greatful Dead concert.

Back to the SVB collapse.  If you're wondering why the market doesn't believe the Fed and keeps pricing in a pivot it's because of the balance sheet action around SVB.  The Fed basically said we're at/close to the top interest rate, and you're damn right we're going to save the market with more QE.  That's why we've rallied so hard since SVB.

JPows last press conference didn't make any sense.  He said shit like inflation remains too high, we know inflation hurts the poor, we predict the need for two more hikes, but.......... we're pausing because stocks only go up.  

We're in for a rally as long as rates hold.  During the Great Recession interest rates increased 4.25% and held at 5.25% for 12 months.  SPY rallied 17% before dumping.  Today, rates have increased 5%, but we'll probably reach 5.25%.  Who knows how long it will hold (the hike speed was twice as fast as the Great Recession), but the QE put is saying it doesn't matter for the market.

As we speak, JPow is installing AI on the money printer.  That shit is going from dot matrix to Bing powered by ChatGPT, with dead president's pictures drawn by DallE2, a fleet of Nvidia Titan 5's, located in a server room where the techs are Musk and Zuckerberg who are forced to wrestle in an eternal cage match while being watched by the AI overlord Watermelon Fucker 3000...aka JPow."

He keeps saying how innovative Intel is and how after being around 53 years they are the leader in chips.  Instead, AMD, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semi are eating their lunch.  If they are so great why can’t they be the best again without needing government support?  This is the dumbest argument I’ve ever seen.

It’s time for capitalism to start working the way it was designed again.  Stop with the subsidies, tax breaks, backrooom deals, etc…how about we let companies that make the best products and run by the best management teams survive.  Why do we need to pay taxes to support billion dollar companies?

At NVDA's current closing stock price of $292.13, the market is saying that Nvidia is currently the #6 most valuable listed company in the world (by market cap)... yet there are 354 listed companies that have more net earnings than NVDA, and 431 listed companies that have more revenue than NVDA.

While I have no doubt that NVDA will climb up in the earnings and revenue rankings after future earnings reports, they still have a long LONG way to go to justify being the #6 most valuable company in the world by market cap.

Yup, I'm the egghead who posted my Yolo on Newegg (NEGG).  Here's my position below, and I'm all in! The other \~ $2,000 I have in some call options that'll surely expire worthless soon enough, and the other 503 shares are in a highly speculative penny stock that'll probably go to zero at a sloth like pace slow enough that I'll just keep holding it until I finally sell it at 3 pennies and feel like a smart trader for not selling at 0. Anyway...

[source: \(Here's that wsb post if you want to see: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/x0qkzc\/newegg\_yolo\_report\/ \) ](https://preview.redd.it/boqube9oqqk91.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d527af8f788b85a2c046d96f16f7d54fe8713a6)

**Now I can tell you why I'm yolo'ing everything into this company**

I've been buying computer parts from Newegg for as long as I can remember, and they fall into that category of companies like GME, AMC, BB, BBBY that are getting displaced (newegg perhaps by amazon and maybe Best Buy). That said, the fundamentals of the company look sound and I found some good DD that I'll share below. I'm collecting this DD here so its all in one place for you to explain  my egghead journey.

**Mary F'ing Poppins**

This company has popped more times then there have been Mary Poppins movies (So more than twice fools). Every few months this pops but now this Newegg has been beat up unfairly. Looking at the chart, I like what I see. A nice downward trend and lots of sharp prickly spikes up (none of that slow up movement that I would get bored with, I'm here for all or nothing plays!).

[source: https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=newgg+stock ](https://preview.redd.it/wsi3xd4erqk91.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0ab6c174c70a0a2a405e77844c8d52f168bab7c6)

**The Previous Due Diligence**

First, I checked out some of the DD from very reliable resources (i.e. stocktwits the king of all reliable and truthful information)

* There's been a few rumblings on Newegg (Stock ticker NEGG) and I've been watching the Stocktwits board for some DD.
* This full on scrambled egghead made a DD as a picture that seems to check out.
   * [https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original\_480607704.gif](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_480607704.gif)
   * I copied the meme, and I suggest you make one too if you got nothing out of this [https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/112528910/Guy-checks-out-red-dress-girl](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/112528910/Guy-checks-out-red-dress-girl)
* On wallstbets there's been recent DD posts which I believe to be solid.
   * **This post made me buy in**
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wq1yl4/why\_i\_believe\_negg\_is\_a\_candidate\_for\_a\_runup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wq1yl4/why_i_believe_negg_is_a_candidate_for_a_runup/)
   * This post was also made, and it checks out that the float of this ticker is low. I like these low floaters. The float is around 12 million shares and I think due for a moon landing soon (I'll talk about why it's unfairly beaten down again towards the end).
      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjbf07/negg\_rocket\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjbf07/negg_rocket_time/)

**The financial situation**

Watching the recent Sith Lord move by Ryan Cohen on BBBY, it made me nervous on companies. BBBY is slapping RC in the face right now though, so it's all good. Anyway, I took a look at Neweggs financials before my major yolo move.

Normally I just buy call options and pray to the SPY lords, but again, the eggs were cheap enough to buy a massive amount. Newegg is profitable by a decent enough and a growing profit margin could be a big catalyst if they surprise on their earnings. And if their earnings suck, that's probably better for  so I can buy more cheap eggs. Either way, I'm just trying to get as many eggs as possible here.

The sales/revenue for 2021 of 2.38B exceeds the market cap (fluctuating between 1.3 and 1.6 billion recently). Again,  mostly I just liked seeing green on the profit section. I rarely see green these days, so any green is pleasant. I like online businesses as well, because they seem to scale a bit better. Newegg has

**The Growth Potential**

The growth potential on this one seems really strong based on where the price has been. In the past 52-weeks this has been has high as $22.20 (18 months ago it say $79+), and has been unfairly beaten down to the 3s range where it stands currently.

There are probably some bag holders here in the 10s or maybe higher. The current bag holders are likely holding a good percentage of the 12 million float. Insiders are holding about 97% of the shares right now, so that's where the 12 million float figure checks out. I suspect insiders are going to be holding this for a while and waiting for a bigger recovery. Right now it looks like about 40% of the stock is shorted and rising rapidly.

[source: https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/short-interest\/most-shorted ](https://preview.redd.it/uejd7vy4tqk91.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=993099c2c6f6f35861f3912ec5d67287274c34ce)

**Thesis and Catalysts**

The short volume is consistently above 60% which implies short interest is going to keep rising. Folks just believe that people aren't buying computers anymore which is silly.

* I think Newegg should normalize to a more fair evaluation (Maybe 8-10 dollar range)
   * That'd put around a 12x multiple on the gross profits to reach a market cap over 4 billion, that is brought in. That's a normal-ish to where this stock has been. The 200 daily moving average for instance held around the 7s most of the summer (see source below).
   * GME and AMC had longer runs, but I think Newegg spikes violently up, and then it'll float around that 8-10 zone and drift slowly up or down after.
* Newegg has an earnings report coming up, so I think if they report good earnings some shorts may start to close position for a mini bump (thinking modest, maybe a spike to $5-6).
   * If it's a crap earning report, I think this will get shorted more and then its even more of a rocket move later in the year around Black Friday Sales.
* With NVidia's earning report somewhat sucking, I think Newegg is in a position to start getting some more leverage.
   * Newegg launched a new laptop finder tool ([https://www.newegg.com/tools/laptop-finder](https://www.newegg.com/tools/laptop-finder)) and has been doing a few other developer events to get the word out. Back to school sales, hybrid work, and the general refresh should help keep sales coming in strong.
      * Newegg has a good Direct to consumer and Direct to Business ([https://www.neweggbusiness.com/](https://www.neweggbusiness.com/)) options. They also have more recently a way to finance payments (using affirm for example [https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/affirm/](https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/affirm/)) that is very consumer friendly.
   * I think management is making a lot of right decisions to grow the business and I think NEGG management is waiting to grow the company and let their eggs hatch when the time is right. The time is right when the eggs get very big (think Ostrich size eggs, not the eggs you get at the grocery store).

[Daily moving averages https:\/\/www.barchart.com\/etfs-funds\/quotes\/NEGG\/technical-analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/ngsdm65q0rk91.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e7652e0b680a9b16737f38a3924d6f098d25325)

**This stock was beaten down unfairly**

In December of 2020 the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) said they were basically going to audit a bunch of foreign (i.e. Ali Baba like) companies. I think since Newegg has Chinese ownership they were lumped into this category.

* After actually taking 5 seconds to run a ctrl+f on the list here, Newegg was not to be found: [https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa](https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa)
   * I believe the slow drop in price this summer has been FUD spreading, see the next bullet though.
* According to this story here (released today, August 28) U.S.-China relations just got better as they figured out a process. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-china-relations-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-boosting-the-prospects-of-these-three-stocks-11661682894](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-china-relations-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-boosting-the-prospects-of-these-three-stocks-11661682894)
* Again, NEWEGG was never involved or at risk of de-listing, but the FUD spread wild and the price dripped down.

**Did I buy some Eggs**

As you now know, I'm putting (almost) all my eggs in one basket here and now have a position of about 14,100 shares at Newegg. It fits in to my red portfolio, and I'm going to buy more eggs and tell you about it here.

Papa Powell wants to make it hard on me to make money this year it looks like, but I think now is as good a time as ever to dive in. If it goes lower and my trash portfolio gets obliterated, I'll just make some scrambled eggs at my new job at McDonalds (morning shift).

**What Kind of Egghead are you?**

I'm a hard boiled egg. So consider buying some eggs now or just post a bunch of bad egg jokes here, I don't care. More egg jokes = more profits for us all. **""When we get to the egg farts we know we're winning. We will run to the moon in great fear when we smell egg farts."" - Aristotle**

**So remember**

1. buy computer parts (preferably from newegg)
2. Put your eggs in this basket (I heard the Easter bunny won't like you for taking his eggs though)
3. This ticker keeps popping every few months. The lower share price means rocket time.
4. This ticker for now fits perfectly in my all red portfolio until I take the shorts eggs for $$$"

195,Intel Thesis,37,13se08o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13se08o/intel_thesis/,87,1685109532.0,"I think Intel is a generational buying opportunity.

Why?

While most believe it to be a boomer stock with shit fundies, they are missing the bigger picture.

1) Process Nodes - Intel got fat and happy. They let the Taiwanese surpass them using technology that Intel itself was a primary player in developing/funding (EUV machines via ASML). Intel has recently hired a new CEO that while on the surface seems brain dead, is actually a legendary engineer who has Intel on the path to take back leadership in process nodes with 18A. Essentially, they will likely have the fastest/most energy efficient chips in the world in 2024 or 2025.

2) AI - A lot of mouth breathers out there believe that Nvidia will be the only player in AI. They don’t understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt). Their GPU hardware is legit and their most recent data center max is outperforming the Nvidia flagship H100 by 30% across many workloads. 

3) Gaming - Gamers hate Nvidia for constantly raising prices while giving shittier performance per $. Intel ARC GPUs will erode market share in a big way over time. I expect the next model, battlemage, to take significant share from Nvidia as the performance per $ will be unbelievable. 

4) Foundry services - Intel is the only leading edge chip manufacturer in the West. As tensions continue to heat up over Taiwan, more and more companies will have Intel manufacturing their designs at fabs in the US. Intel will likely surpass Samsung as the #2 fab in the world by 2030.

5) Western Governments - Fabs are the next oil and Intel is the only game in town for the west when it comes to bleeding edge. I expect the majority of the chips act to go to Intel. Same with the European chips bill. These bills won’t be one offs either. Intel has a monopoly on Western leading edge chips and will get all of the government contracts, grants, funding, etc associated with that.

6) Taiwan - If something happens in Taiwan, even a simple blockade, I would expect the majority of fabless producers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, etc) to come running to Intel. If things get heated between the US and China, the US could ensure that all chips for important industries (healthcare, banking, etc) be manufactured in the United States.

These are just the top six reasons why Intel is generationally cheap. 

I would load up on 2025 leaps and keep rolling them back."

>  
>**AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120**  
>  
>*The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung.*  
>  
>*Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings.*  
>  
>*Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used.*  
>  
>*With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment.*  
>  
>*Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry.*

# Background

Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.

# Purpose

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.

# Methodology

Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:

* Discounted Free Cash Flow
* Graham's Fair Value
* Graham's Number

# Industry Outlook

**Overview**

The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.

Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.

Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:

* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.
* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.
* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.
* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.

In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.

It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.

The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.

# Main Competitors

Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.
* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.
* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.

These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.

# Fair Value

Taking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.

**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**

Plugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36

**Graham's Fair Value**

The Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.

**Graham's Number**

By using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.

# Conclusions

**Disclaimer**

We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.

**The Future**

Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.

**Conclusions**

INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.

*1.	Bond market started to price in the “higher for longer” narrative but not the stock market.* The probability of a 25 basis point hike in May is now at 89% (last week I said it should be 100% when it was 66%), and the 2024 year-end Fed rate estimation has increased from 2.99% to 3.13%. However, the market-projected Fed rate path still suggests a 1% rate cut within the year and another 1.2% cut next year, which creates a large gap between market expectations and the Fed schedule, greatly affecting stock valuations (more details in the next section). 

https://preview.redd.it/pdiipbvxrova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=235c5b91e978482e15656c833868ab827c0c88c0

On the inflation front, this week’s data is a mixed bag; overall, things are cooling, but there are some warning signs that the disinflation process may not be a smooth ride. You can find all the charts in my daily post, and the table below provides a summary.

https://preview.redd.it/4lbrlp5msova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16ea8cb2d93baf9ffc0118e13daf817bfa3d09bc

*2.	Major economic indicators were also mixed last week, with four releases showing confusing results.* However, as mentioned in my daily post, ""things are bad, but not all bad."" For now, it seems safe to say that we are not at an imminent risk of a recession. Here is a summary of the manufacturing-related indicators/components:

https://preview.redd.it/kghldy13tova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52abca5da684948c8399973198cc83c429dc9446

Clearly, things are improving. Even the Philly Fed data wasn't that bad; many components were down year over year but improving compared to March. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) still looks bad, but that's based on March data. The Flash PMI showed signs of expansion, but the business outlook was still negative, and both input and output prices rose sharply, which is bad news for inflation.

3.	Earnings are better than expected so far, but still mark the largest earnings decline since Q2 2020. As of last week, 18% of the S&P 500 had reported earnings, and 76% beat estimates by an average of 5.8%, both below the 5-year average (77% and 8.4%). On the revenue side, 63% beat estimates by an average of 1.8%, both below the 5-year average (69% and 2%). Margins declined to 11.2%, the lowest since Q4 2020. For Q2 guidance, only 14 companies had given guidance, and 9 gave negative guidance compared to 5 positive. Analysts' 2023 full-year EPS estimates were slightly higher at $220, but 2024 EPS was slightly lowered to $246

**My positions and predictions**

***US Equity***

*Valuation*

I use a forward PE model, and here are the analyst estimations:

2023 Full Year EPS: $220

NTM: $227

2024 Full Year EPS: $246

Current SP500 forward PE is at 18.2, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. However, given the extreme QE situation of the past few years, these averages (especially 5-yr average) may not be the best point of comparison. If we compare current stock valuations to those of 2019, they don't appear to be very expensive.

https://preview.redd.it/voaozyw7uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fb5cd01ef80629686892f8d0988845e4c6da7f58

If you break it down by growth vs value and MegaCaps, the valuation doesn’t look bad either. We are still at 2019 levels, and in fact, growth's forward PE is lower today.

https://preview.redd.it/e3wdomx8uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=665ee60e7755f3e82a57e4478c30f7191e05d460

But here is the parameter that really reflects the gap between market expectations and reality: risk premium!

https://preview.redd.it/ry2p7ijqxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77e51427f18c3ea32287467e0bb3450144820300

https://preview.redd.it/bqfs0imrxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a14bedaabbdfcb9c1da7c45c6a8282649b6f8769

The reason why the S&P 500 is priced at such a high forward P/E multiple is probably because the market is expecting rate cuts this year. As I mentioned in the last section, the market is still projecting a 1% cut this year and 1.2% next year. While I am not sure what’s going to happen next year, based on last week’s upbeat economic data, I certainly don’t expect rate cuts this year, and definitely not as much as a 1% cut! Therefore, I think the “higher for longer” narrative is starting to be priced into bond prices, but certainly not into stock prices yet.

The 10-year average risk premium is around 3-3.5%. If we use a 3% risk premium for valuation, today's stock should have a forward PE of 15.4. Given that NTM EPS is $227 and 2024 EPS is $246, the SPX should be at 3495 today and 3788 by year end (although it might be higher since the T-bill yield is expected to be lower by year end).

https://preview.redd.it/lia9edxtxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a17504a552910b33f14c49cd4c05b1d538f396a

*Now let's look at what's lying ahead:*

*Tailwinds for stocks:* 

Cooling rent and inflation: Service CPI is currently the biggest problem for inflation, and rent is 60% of the service sector. Last week, rent increases finally crossed over to negative territory. The Fed uses a lagging rent indicator that tracks the 6-month average of rent changes, so we should have seen the peak rent CPI, and the April number may surprise to the downside.

Diving LEI on Fed: LEI has been a very accurate indicator in suggesting a recession. Unlike Empire State and Philly Fed, which are surveys and have a lot of noise, LEI is based on actual data. Historically, when LEI is at this level, we have a 100% chance of entering a recession. So, this number should carry good weight on Fed decision-making going forward. Especially if ISM (to be released on May 1st) is telling the same story, the Fed might decide to pause at their May meeting. I put this in the tailwind, but a recession eventually might not be good for stocks (I will discuss more if May ISM drops again).

Stronger than expected earnings: Q1 earnings so far have been pretty good at -6.2% YoY instead of -6.7% YoY as estimated. If this trend continues, analysts might dial up their full-year EPS estimations, which is good for stocks. The stronger economic activity showed in the Empire State and Flash PMI reports also supports better earnings in Q2. Although this might also indicate that inflation could pick up again, or at least be stickier than the Fed anticipated, so not a 100% tailwind either.

Investors are extremely bearish on equities and bullish on bonds: Unless there is some really bad earnings or economic data or a really hawkish Fed, the pain trade-up (or moving sideways) will probably continue.

https://preview.redd.it/1vcxng0vxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eea5676a46182787f08a4efbac860030a81c3c33

*Headwind for stocks:*

CB liquidity tightening on track: We might have or about to reach the peak of CB rate tightening, however, most of the CB balance sheet tightening has not even started yet. I mentioned in my post multiple times that global liquidity correlates very well with stock performance and is a leading indicator. But do pay attention to two CBs, PBOC and BOJ. These are the only two CBs that are loosening their liquidity, and both have a deflation problem instead of an inflation problem.

https://preview.redd.it/lml8tv9wxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e076d732f40962bd102fda781fac4730f6a8828

Debt ceiling: The debt ceiling has never been a real problem. Anytime the market falls because of the debt ceiling, it turns out to be a good buying opportunity. But this year's problem is that it's coming a lot faster than anticipated. With declining tax revenue and a higher budget deficit, the debt ceiling might come in less than two months. Even though I still don't see how either party could allow this to happen, the derivative market (chart below 1-yr US debt CDS) and bond market (people rushed into 1-month bonds) are apparently freaking out a little bit. But not a single fuck was given in the stock market.

https://preview.redd.it/pldwgfywxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cea581efc47dd6afe6c31efd58518e92ae57aee2

Credit crunch: Even though it feels like the bank crisis is already behind us, the impact has not yet manifested. With the majority of banks increasing their lending standards (especially regional banks, who are losing deposits at the fastest pace in history), more and more small businesses are finding it harder to get a loan. As a result, the number of companies filing for bankruptcy has passed COVID levels. If the Fed continues to hike, this could get ugly really quickly.

https://preview.redd.it/8mlymncyxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=091e0b9a21a552f6de2e334afed506220ed0187e

Resilient economy on Fed: As I mentioned earlier, some of last week's economic data showed that both US and global economic activity are beginning to recover. This might not be a good sign for inflation, and remember that the Fed's goal is 1% GDP growth and 4.5% unemployment (we are at 2% and 3.5%, respectively). An early recovery means the Fed has to hike more and for longer to bring the inflation down. Obviously not good for stonks.

To sum it up, stocks are pricey but not at an extreme level using the forward PE model. Other models like the PE, PS, and PEG models also lead to the same conclusion (data not shown). The risk premium shows that the market has not fully priced in the ""higher for longer"" narrative and a pull back seems appropriate. The majority of tailwinds have already been priced in, as implied by yield compression, but most headwinds have not been, which could lead to higher yields or a recession, and in turn, a pull back in stock price. Overall, I see limited upside for stocks from here, and a pullback might happen soon. However, the current data do not support a major recession in the near future, as I wrote about in Friday's post. US family and business balance sheets are in great shape, with lots of cash and low leverage.

**Update on my year-end projection:**

Base case (orange): No changes from last week. In 2023, SP500 earnings are the same as 2022 ($220), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (the historical average is 7.8%, but given how resilient the US economy is, I still think 10% is appropriate). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today.

Bull case (green): Reduced earnings estimation based on Q1 results so far.  In 2023, SP500 earnings are up 5% YoY (to $231 based on Q1 results so far), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (to $254; current analyst estimations are at $246). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule the same number of cuts by the end of 2023 as anticipated today (Dovish).

Bear case (red): Increase earning estimation based on Q1 results so far. We hit a mild recession with a 5% earnings decline in 2023 but expect to swing back to $225 in 2024 (7.5% growth). Inflation will be well under control, but the Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today but will increase the pace in 2024 (hawkish).

The light blue box indicates where we are today. If we use the 10-year average forward PE ratio, 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use the risk premium model, we should be close to 3500.

***US Treasury Bond (TLT)***

My view on TLT remains the same as last week. The ""higher for longer"" narrative is not fully priced in, so short-term TLT will still be under pressure. But on the other hand, unless inflation is out of control, Fed cuts will be gradually priced into TLT throughout the year. Range movement is likely in the next few months, but once the Fed is clearer about the cut schedule, TLT will start to climb.

Yes NVIDIA is selling a lot of high margin AI product as Cloud datacenters scale to handle the demand. Be aware they are being positioned as the only option. They are not and in fact have solutions that do not benchmark at the top. 

Also be aware that the network infrastructure for AI to AI interconnect is different than historical DC networking.  To address this Google (creator of the modern Tensorcore) created a new networking paradigm - Apollo.   Facebook is working on similar and Tesla (every car is machine learning)  implemented their own (superior) Tensorcore array called DOJO.   Apple is investing deeply into AI and more of the M processor die space will have Tensorcores. AMD and Intel of course are in also in play.

I state this because the hypster press would have you believe NVIDIA has a lock. Not at all. They did not invent it BUT are doing a great job of holding their installed base with it.   The barrier to entry is LOW.  PCI interfaces, memory structures and Tensorcores are all pedestrian readily available tech. NOBODY has a monopoly on it. No moat.

Several other players are also making purpose built AI clusters that scale well beyond anything NVIDIA can even do.   Watch for acquisitions.

# S&P 500's Rollercoaster Ride: Breaking Records, Facing Setbacks, and May's Disappointing Gains

**June 1st Recap**

The S&P 500's year-to-date increment approaches 10% as a rejuvenated surge in technology giants takes the stage before Friday's forthcoming employment data release. This expansion comes with the anticipation of the Federal Reserve momentarily halting interest rate augmentations in June.

Major tech corporations have resumed their impressive advancement after a temporary hiatus, propelled by the fervor surrounding artificial intelligence. Nvidia Corp's equity value increased by around 5%, surpassing the Nasdaq 100's performance. Beyond the artificial intelligence-induced momentum which catapulted mega-corporations by 17% in May, the sector also experienced an upliftment due to decreased bond yields and Dell Technologies reporting sales figures that surpassed projections.

The S&P 500 index rose by 1% on Thursday, recapturing the 4,200 mark. Bank of America Corp's contrarian index, which monitors the average stock allocation advice offered by Wall Street strategists, is nearest to a 'buy' indication it's been in over half a decade.

Beyond the artificial intelligence theme, market participants are also preparing for the release of the employment data on Friday. Analysts predict a deceleration in hiring activity, which could persuade the Federal Reserve to pause its monetary tightening strategy in June momentarily.

Patrick Harker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said a pause in interest rate increases should be considered in the forthcoming meeting. James Bullard, his counterpart from St. Louis, echoed this sentiment in a published essay on Thursday, suggesting that interest rates would likely be at the lower spectrum of what is necessary to subdue inflation.

# The Red Envelope Revelation: Shaping the Future of Global Markets

Tomorrow promises to be a day of significant economic developments, with major reports due that are expected to impact market trends. Chief among these will be May's highly anticipated U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls data. Regarded as a red-envelope news event, this report carries considerable weight as it can catalyze significant market movements.

https://preview.redd.it/ysx0k37v9i3b1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a149712e7b898e5f11f6d19c14c25ac2dbbc4896

At 8:30 am (ET), the U.S. employment report is scheduled to be released. This crucial index is poised to provide an overview of the current state of the American job market. The median forecast for this report stands at 190,000, down notably from the previous figure of 253,000. If these predictions hold, this could signify a slight slowing in job creation which may stir market reactions.

Simultaneously, the U.S. unemployment rate for May will also be announced. Current estimates suggest a minor uptick to 3.5%, up from 3.4% in the previous period. Though minimal, the incremental rise could fuel discussions around labor market conditions and future policy decisions.

Alongside this, the U.S. hourly wages for May will be disclosed, with projections pointing to a 0.3% increase. This is somewhat lower than the 0.5% growth experienced in the previous month. Such a decline might trigger concerns about wage growth stagnation, consequently influencing market sentiments.

Lastly, the year-over-year increase in hourly wages will also be unveiled, with forecasts predicting a slight dip to 4.4% from 4.5%. This figure will further feed into analyses of wage growth and the general health of the U.S. economy.

All eyes will undoubtedly be on these significant economic reports, eagerly anticipating their implications on the U.S. and global markets.

209,RBLX is likely to miss considerably on earnings after market close today,32,wk3eeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wk3eeh/rblx_is_likely_to_miss_considerably_on_earnings/,37,1660051878.0,"Roblox have already published estimates for April and May, meaning we already have two thirds of the puzzle:

April revenue: $189 million - $192 million
May revenue: $194 million - $197 million

Q2 earnings will be published after market close today with a consensus estimate of 639.2 million in revenue and -0.25 EPS.

To meet the consensus estimate, the revenue for June would have to be 250m-256m, roughly a 30% increase over May. This seems highly unlikely.

Earlier in the year RBLX signaled that they expected the summer to be an opportunity for growth. There are indications that the opposite happened.

There are websites that track user activity across Roblox. This data is far from perfect, but it has previously served as an indication of change in user activity. This data suggests June having lower activity than May and July having even lower activity. ( Estimates for July will be published together with the Q2 earnings, helping with future guidance )

My simple thesis was that this was the first summer without social distancing since Covid, meaning less time (and money) has been spent on video games.

Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and Nvidia have all reported reduced consumer spending on gaming in the second quarter. According to NPD, Americans spent 13% less on gaming in the second quarter. 

Additionally, RBLX cited the strong dollar as one of the reasons for a “weak” May. The dollar was also strong in June, and even stronger in July.

Put all this together and an earnings miss seems highly likely.

I found very little data as to expenses, but what I did find (mostly hiring data) suggests increased expenses in Q2 vs Q1.

Based on available data and conjecture, I predict revenue to come in at 550-570 million for the quarter vs 639.2 million estimate, EPS of -0.28 vs -0.25 estimate, and revenue for July to be disappointing, suggesting a weak guidance.

RBLX shares are currently trading at 48.92, up 14% over the last week and up 23.91% over the last month.

**AMZN** - gone from customer favorite to universally hated.

**FSLY/NET** - grew on the back of pandemic and social trends like WFH, Tiktok, remote schooling.  World is opening up and content distribution more commoditized with slowing growth.

**SOFI/RKT** - alternative financials, Fintechs.  The assumption is that mortgages and loans will be a stock market Death Valley for years to come thanks to fed inflation fighting panic moves.  Their clients tend to be more vulnerable, younger, lower assets, lower credit, etc.  

**any of the EV juniors, suppliers, battery companies** - things like Canoo, Rivian, Micro-Vast, Frey, QS.  All were once valued on the premise of ""what if they can just take 2% market share?""  Now that feels like a pipe dream.

212,A detailed DD for AMD in AI (Instinct MI300 breakdown),30,1499y3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1499y3o/a_detailed_dd_for_amd_in_ai_instinct_mi300/,13,1686754405.0,"Hello fellow degens, this is a followup for my DD on Nvidia:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

I'll have you know that since I posted that, NVDA has gone up 40% and I'm quite handsomely profitable. I still think Nvidia is a winner and I am holding my position. Also an interesting fact is I was the first person in the market to buy that particular call strike/date, but now the OI on that call is 635. Its now the highest OI OTM NVDA call out of any long term dates, and I'm going to take credit for all the other regards that bought into that call. **So a total of $5.8M was invested because of my last DD on just that option alone, and there's probably a lot more investment that can be attributed to my post. You're welcome regards.**

**This post is about AMD's newly announced Instinct MI300**, which is their contender for best AI chip. The release was met with lukewarm reaction from the market, and my guess is because it didn't include ASIC tensor units like Nvidia's H100. However, it still is going to be competitive in AI and it boils down to this:

**Processing speed isn't everything.**

The H100 will blow the MI300 out of the water when it comes to raw processing speed and raw processing efficiency for AI tasks, but the MI300 does have one trick up its sleeve: very high memory capacity and very high memory bandwidth.

**Where the H100 has 80 GB of memory per card, and the MI300 has 192 GB per chip.**

Memory is critical for large language models (LLMs), because the top models now need over 100 GB of memory to run efficiently -- meaning no single GPU can run them currently. You can split up the memory of the models onto multiple cards or keep some of the model in RAM, but this dramatically slows down calculations. For this reason, memory is a HUGE bottleneck for LLMs.

**The MI300 will be the only option for extremely large models (the smartest ones) when it comes out in Q2.**

Furthermore the MI300 has another trick up its sleeve: Its HBM memory is directly on chip integrated into the AMD Infinity Fabric bus, as compared to Nvidia's cards where the HBM is on separate chips on the card. This means AMD inherently can get much higher memory bandwidth. Estimates are 8TB/s for the MI300 vs 2-3 TB/S for the H100. This will mean that tensors can be loaded into the MI300's GPU more efficiently causing less latency (downtime) for the processing units.

More interesting facts about the MI300:

* It is an APU, meaning it has both a GPU and a CPU
* The CPU is a basically like a 24 core Ryzen
* The GPU is like smashing over two 7900XTX's together (its titanic)
* This is one of the largest ICs ever at 146B transistors (The H100 is 80B transistors)

What does all this mean?

* **For non-AI compute workloads the MI300 is likely to be the king of efficiency out of any available products** \-- it will be widely deployed in supercomputers across the world. Their first flagship customer is the DOE, which owns a large portion of the largest super computers in the world.
* **Also for the largest AI workloads, it will be the only good option for a few months until the H100 NVL comes out**

How does it stack against the H100 NVL? The NVL model is a new version of the H100 coming out in the second half of the year. It is basically like a normal H100 that is capable of SLI (NVLink). This allows users to put two H100 NVLs together via a special link so they operate like one logical compute unit. That will give Nvidia a 188 GB option (via 2 cards linked together). However NVLink has extremely poor memory bandwidth which will exacerbate the difference between the MI300's extremely good memory bandwidth. Its hard to say whether the H100 NVL solution will be better than the MI300 for very large language models, but my guess is the H100 NVL will probably be better for most. The MI300 will be excellent for them however, so its likely that many cloud providers will chose it because it is also fantastic for general purpose OpenCL where the H100 is a specialized card.

What am I doing? I'm buying some AMD in addition to my NVDA. I've also bought some SMH calls which have exposure to both NVDA and AMD. I'm at about 4:1 exposure NVDA:AMD right now, but I'll bring that up to 2:1.

Nvidia shares dipped 8% on Monday morning after the company released preliminary earnings that show second-quarter revenue of $6.7 billion, well below its initial outlook of $8.1 billion.

The chipmaker said the shortfall primarily reflects weaker-than-forecast gaming revenue, which is down 44% sequentially and 33% from the prior year. Nvidia said the report is “primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds.”

It also said its data enter segment has been impacted by supply chain disruptions and preliminary revenue of $3.81 billion is below the company’s expectations. That figure is still up 1% over last quarter and up 61% year over year, however.

Ark Invest's (ARKK) Cathie Wood has bought more than $60 million of Nvidia (NVDA) yesterday following its drop of 8% after preannouncing weak Q2 sales. What are your thoughts on this move by Cathie Wood?"

Nvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard’s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.

So… Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.

It's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.

But here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.

And how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.

Now, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.

Bottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting ""hybrid cloud or bust!"" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.

IBM’s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two’s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO"

I'm not saying Nvidia is a buy, but let's cut the PR spin and call out Cathie Woods for bad forecasting.

Nvidia's Q4 2023 Revenue was $6.051Bn.

(then Cathie Woods sold Nvidia, presumably)

Q1 2024 Revenue came in at $7.192Bn with a monster Q2 guide of $11Bn.

This is how the valuation looks:

Revenue = $11Bn

Opex of \~$1.75Bn

Operating income of $5.95Bn

(who the f\*\^% knows what the tax rate will be, but let's say...)

220,NVDA GPU prices are skyrocketing ...,27,ybc8yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ybc8yp/nvda_gpu_prices_are_skyrocketing/,37,1666513882.0,"TLDR: NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily... 

4090 GPUs are selling in hot demand after absolutely shattering the gaming records set by the 3090 last year at the same price point. The selling prices right now are >$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. 

Although NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.

>If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.

>People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. 

NVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. 

There are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA.

&#x200B;

>TSMC, the leading semiconductor foundry, is set to significantly expand its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity by the end of 2024. According to DigiTimes, TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 wafers per month by the end of this year and aims to reach around 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024. However, even with this expansion, it is anticipated that Nvidia will consume approximately half of the capacity available at that time. AMD is also reportedly seeking additional CoWoS capacity for next year.  
>  
>The growing demand for technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) is driving the adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs, exemplified by products like AMD's Instinct MI300 and Nvidia's H100. Nvidia, in particular, is considered the primary beneficiary of the increasing demand for AI-focused compute GPUs and currently controls over 90% of compute GPU shipments for new deployments. Consequently, TSMC is facing challenges in meeting the demand for its CoWoS advanced packaging solutions.

&#x200B;

>Presently, TSMC has the capacity to process approximately 8,000 CoWoS wafers per month, with Nvidia and AMD utilizing about 70% to 80% of this capacity. Following them, Broadcom represents the third-largest user, accounting for around 10% of the available CoWoS wafer processing capacity. The remaining capacity is divided among 20 other fabless chip designers.  
>  
>Expanding CoWoS capacity requires specialized production tools, and their lead times typically range from three to six months. Hence, TSMC's ability to rapidly increase its CoWoS capacity is constrained."

I know some of you struggle to find motivation with your loss porn.

But owning AMD will give you a reaction stronger than viagra.

AMD beat both on top and bottom lines, achieving 8 **record quarters of revenues**, hitting $6.6bn, with yearly **growth of 70%**.

As of today, both Intel and Nvidia have **MISSED** their Q2 earnings.

**Intel**: reported their **first quarterly loss since 2017**. Investors are **horrified**, as Pat's ""rearview mirror"" statement is haunting him. Their discrete GPU (ARC) is a **FAILURE**. Their Sapphire Rapids server chip for the datacenter are a no-show, while they keep losing share to EPYC.

**Nvidia**: just reported revenues of to $6.7bn, a  reduction of over $1bn from initial expectations. They can't get rid of their RTX 3000 over production. Next quarter guidance is $5.9 billion a HUGE drop from the $8.3bn last quarter and **LESS THAN AMD's revenue**.

**AMD PASSED NVIDIA IN SALES THIS QUARTER**

Not only AMD's revenues is up by 70% thanks to the Xilinx integration, but AMD is entering the telecommunications and automotive industries. AMD is the ONLY semiconductor company that reiterated its 2022 guidance, while the competition is revising downwards.

**This year belongs to AMD.**

**Breaking down AMD by markets:**

**Client:**  Consumer PC's have dropped as we head into the second half of 2022. The exceptional demand created by COVID-19 is gone, as consumers have the equipment they need. AMD expects the rest of 2022 to have a mid-teen drop in sales, but still record and better than last year's.

**Gaming:**  which includes GPUs and gaming consoles, is getting hit from the GPU  side, as demand drops from mining and new GPUs coming out in the next 3 months (consumers hold their purchases  before new generation launches). However, expect the drop to be offset by console chips (Xbox, Playstation, Steam Deck, Aya, etc.), which have a sales spike in Q3.

**Embedded:**  Entirely comprised of Xilinx products is a door opener for AMD, as it  will increase its offering and TAM. Expect this business to continue growing at double digits.

**Datacenter:** the jewel of the crown, growing 83% year over year, is **VERY STRONG**  and continues to take market from Intel. Genoa, Genoa-X and Bergamo  Epyc chips will continue taking market from Intel. This market is bound  to become AMD's largest business next year.

**SAMSUNG, TESLA, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent**... all major tech companies are buying AMD chips for their products and infrastructure.

To summarize, AMD's execution has been **ROCK SOLID**.

You now have a chance to buy the stock at double digits.... CALL NOW!!!

&#x200B;

**AMD's Stock Price Target: ($120 for Q3, $150 for Q4, all time high in 2023).**

**Remember:** AMD launches Zen 4 Ryzen chips next month (September), as well as its RDNA3 Radeon High-end gaming GPUs in November, and the Genoa Epyc chips in Q4.

**This is AMD's BEST YEAR in terms of product launches.**

I expect AMD to hit its all time high in 2023, likely in the first half of the year.

It is heading to the moon, leaving the competition behind. All aboard!!!

It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Note- all data for this document was obtained on 12/27 during and after market close. 

Now lets go ahead and break this all down and rank them… what I am going to do is rank 1 through 9… 1 would be a bearish indicator on the stock and a 9 would be a bullish indicator. 

**What is Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E?**

The forward P/E uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. The trailing P/E, which is the standard form of a price-to-earnings ratio, is calculated using recent past earnings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/de6ha5h8po8a1.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a1ceea52b0ce863abac49f325fc8af0c5caf8e6

Based on standard PE we actually see that Amazon has the current highest PE at 78.28 and Meta (not surprisingly) has the lowest PE at 11.24). This would indicate a strike against Amazon and make it strictly looking at PE the best short. This would obviously make Meta the worse short. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa8hslx8po8a1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=968f8ed0cc58dd72298f65fc219678bbeabb5316

Taking a look at forward P/E you can see that still Amazon with 50.57 has the worst F P/E and Meta at 14.72 has the most favorable PE. 

**What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/krqn1zm9po8a1.png?width=374&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5eab326599593054bd2f167157cca294c21d0b2

The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. A PEG ratio of under 1.0 can indicate a stock is undervalued and a potential buy. A PEG above 1.0 can indicate an overvalued stock.

Taking a look at the PEG ratio (remember the higher the level the most overbought/ over valued the stock is) we see that nvidia with a 3.55 is the most overbought and amazon comes in next with a 2.95. Not surprising Tesla has the lowest at 0.84 (mostly due to the 40%+ drop in the month of December). 

**% changes from critical points** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y1oa9bbapo8a1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=219fdaab7ef0c08572c6a68c268e93fb2d07d4d6

Taking a look at the YTD drop Tesla has had the biggest YTD drop at 71.48% and SPY actually had the smallest YTD drop of just 17.33%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwpdu7uapo8a1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6a7fc0a7c24281f5da4f89b2678190d85e7cc5c5

This breakdown here represents how far above or below the ticker currently is of its weekly 200ema. Apple, MSFT and SPY are the only tickers above its weekly 200ema (the positive number) and all the other tickers are below that number (represented by the negative number). The number represents what % below or % above the weekly 200ema they are…  
 

Currently Apple is the further above its weekly 200ema which could represent that it has the biggest room to fall… Meta is the furthest below its Weekly 200ema. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the % the ticker currently sits below its ATH. You can see that Tesla is sitting -74.7% below its ATH while SPY is only 20.6% below its ATH making SPY potentially have the biggest room to fall. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7po7icxbpo8a1.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aaf9afeb29c86bc2c70a86bd80da3aa63b0a1612

This one here represent how far above or below the current ticker is from the 2020 Covid crash lows. Many believe that the 2020 covid lows is the likely target if we have a market wide sell off in Q1. As you can see Nvidia and Meta are the only tickers below their covid 2020 lows. 

Tesla surprisingly is still 78.6% above its Covid 2020 low. 

**June 16th 2023 Put Premium**

Using the optionscalculator to “optimize” the best put play I came up with the following strikes for potential June 16th DTE puts. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfowsdfcpo8a1.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48873aa3347af3ebfe02342ac017e8ed2722c8f7

The reason I wanted to include this as it shows how pricey premiums already are. As you can see Tesla not surprisingly due to its high IV and further drop expectations is one of the highest premiums and Google remains the lowest. 

**Lets rank the most “overvalued” and most “oversold”**  
   
 

https://preview.redd.it/usobec0dpo8a1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b929f9e5b0a994474b8899773ea2afae5b62e4f1

Remember we ranked 1 through 9. With 1 being overvalued and 9 being oversold. Therefore the lower the overall numbers using all the above metrics the potential better short a stock ticker is. 

So taking a look here we see that Apple is the clear short winner with Amazon, MSFT, and SPY close behind. 

Now lets take a look at these and where we could be heading. We will take a look at Apple, Amazon, MSFT and SPY weekly charts. 

**Apple Weekly chart** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u4nm4xkdpo8a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81f87289b9b2a91a1ab02e3a07ea908f78db4a00

The apple weekly chart in my opinion has the most room to fall… a few big targets to keep in mind here… 

Weekly 200ema- 120.15

Late 2020 support- 106.9

March 2020 support- 57.4

Current bear channel march projection- 64.33 

Current bear channel June projection- 44.15

**Amazon Weekly Chart** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w7y6a83epo8a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34e99bc82fe4402f64eb7508ce1ddb0e8afffcb5

Taking a look here you can see we have been riding down the weekly 8ema and we are within a few weeks of the death cross on amazon (100ema below 200ema). 

March 2020 support- $81.74

Current bear channel march projection- $47.31 

Current bear channel June projection- $32

2017 support- $47.31

2016 support- $24.36

**MSFT weekly chart**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zetxxbmepo8a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5cd2bd5d7304b96b7f909cda78e9b7631afd4d0a

Now when you take a look at MSFT I think much like apple it has one of the strongest of big techs charts this year. It has not seen that massive drop like most of tech has. However, Apple and MSFT are obviously the biggest holdings in SPY for a reason…

Weekly 200ema- $224.47

Late 2020 support- $196.4

March 2020 support- $136.8

Current bear channel march projection- $177.85 

Current bear channel June projection- $157.57

**SPY weekly chart**

Last but not least is our boy spy… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oset9i8fpo8a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4466428517dbb5e8e45daf2ea8c32816ceb59ec

Taking a look at SPY here you can see that we have that similar breakdown as big tech but our bear channel is way wider than most of tech. 

Weekly 200ema- $366.89

Late 2020 support- $325.6

March 2020 support- $228

Current bear channel march projection- $300 

Current bear channel June projection- $281

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So there you have it guys… what I am calling “The Big Short of 2023.” 

Which ticker do you think is the best short? For me from a strictly technical stand point SPY and Apple are the best shorts. However, when I look at everything I personally feel like Amazon is the best potential big short of 2023."

AMD (AMD) stock has been loading it's rocket with fuel since Lisa became the CEO in 2014 (especially in the last 3-4 years) and officially surpassed Intel (INTC) in market cap in Feb '22, on top of which having consistently yuge growth in revenue, R&D, profits, market share, etc and consistently beating estimates, vastly expanding TAM thanks to a highly successful merger with Xilinx earlier this year. Not to mention beginning to surpass Nvidia (NVDA) in several metrics.

Rocket is primed to +10x again by 2030 thanks to good fundamentals and not just memevestors. Stock is way down, perfect time to jump on the train, or hold out for possibly a bit lower entry thanks to poor Nvidia (NVDA) performance and consolidation dragging this stock down in recent weeks.

Viable candidate for a quality meme stock as well.

My position in AMD: All in at about $41k, HODLed since it was about $9 in 2018 (now $95) and continued to buy in since. Don't plan on selling for 5-10+ years.

>I trust you are all faring well amidst these protracted weeks. I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.

>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, ""The money printer is back on!"" ""We're destined for astronomical gains!"" ""S&P $5000, here we come!"" ""There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,"" and so on.  
>

>  
>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.

&#x200B;

Ewwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Recap :**

Season 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let’s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.

I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let’s analyze things from a new perspective and let’s see what markets are trynna tell us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment :** 

**""Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame""**

&#x200B;

In this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.

So let’s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let’s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So let’s just deep dive right in.

*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

USA :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)

&#x200B;

The above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a “Negative correlation” and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of “Negative correlation” But then inflation happened and that’s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in “Positive correlation” i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.

&#x200B;

But now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the “Negative correlation” where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the “Banking crisis” where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It’s one of the chapters of the “Recession playbook” that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for us?

Well in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a “negative correlation” of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.

As for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: “We are still in a strong Positive correlation” of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan & Germany :

So now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still ""Negatively correlated"" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that’s when a “Positive correlation” emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)

&#x200B;

As for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.

&#x200B;

 

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result:  Inconclusive result.

We should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn’t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn’t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

Eurusd-De10y :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don’t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don’t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f’ed then I am hoping Europe will get f’ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It’s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like “What are you talking man” “I am more confused” and “Just tell me up or down” Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383

&#x200B;

This is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let’s not assume anything. It’s still not clear. We need more data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GbpUsd - Gb10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757

&#x200B;

So now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a

&#x200B;

You can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UsdJpy - Jp10y :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2

&#x200B;

Before talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d

&#x200B;

This is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

DXY - Us 10y

&#x200B;

This is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let’s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.

&#x200B;

Now I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.

&#x200B;

Result: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.

Balance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms

&#x200B;

[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)

&#x200B;

As you can clearly see till October every CB’s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) 

Now some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.

&#x200B;

Conclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 1: Deflationary spiral

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|\-ve Gdp|\-ve %|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But soon inflation will go low :

So, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: -ve

&#x200B;

This means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Time taken :

Normally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this ""Inverse them bruh"" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )

This trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> 3.2%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|God knows|God knows|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But then inflation will go higher :

So, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: still +ve

&#x200B;

Overall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?

&#x200B;

\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.

&#x200B;

\- 2b) Let’s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?

Ans: Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**

&#x200B;

Well folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=089fa3dad5ab985e7f667c210cfd583a34eb05af

&#x200B;

This happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. 

&#x200B;

What if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you "" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all"" 

&#x200B;

This above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.

&#x200B;

Sorry, my image limit got hit.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts :**

The real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Enjoy the weekend everyone. 

See you guys next week!
