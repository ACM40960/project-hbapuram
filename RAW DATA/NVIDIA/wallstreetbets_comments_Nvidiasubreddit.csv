Oh that's right people listen to the news, financial advice from the ""professionals"" ü§£

As someone who eventually became a profitable trader, there's two things I'll share that really help. The first one is you have to think about Wall Street like a giant game of liars poker. You don't really know if people are giving you decent advice or if they are just trying to manipulate you for their own means which more times than not is what's going on. The second one is if you watch the movements of the markets long enough you begin to anticipate what's going to happen.

AI has been around a while and ChatGPT isn‚Äôt even considered general intelligence, so not even close to true AI.

As a tech giant, the Nvidia business model involves GPU sales. This graphics company gets most of its revenue from selling these specialized chips, which serve many industries, including the gaming, robotics, automotive, and professional visualization industries.

A chip maker yesterday, a chip maker Tomorrow. You can say they do other stuff but most their revenue is GPU related.

Like I know people wanna speculate and future is unknown. If you can sit down and make the numbers add up I‚Äôll agree.

42 price to sale

Big boys selling

Big girls selling (Cathie)

**Current NVDA stats:**

* Currently trading at $229.65 per share, $567B market cap
* Up +60% YTD, +112% from 52-week lows hit in Oct 2022
* Analysts median price target: $265
* Analysts ratings: 26 Buy (63.4%), 13 Hold (31.7%), 2 Sell (4.8%)
* Short-interest: 1.57%

**Condensed DD/Brief Thesis:**

* Nvidia is at a $567B valuation with a 131 P/E.
* It's P/E is far greater than it was during any period of time in it's history. Well above anything that occurred during ZIRP. For reference, it's current P/E is >30% higher then it's 2021 peak (\~100 P/E) hit in Nov 2021. A period where equities across the board were hitting sky high P/E valuations, GPU's were flying off the shelves, crypto hit an all-time high of $2.9T, and rates were 0%.

This suggests it's being modeled for extreme growth, but:

* The Inflation Reduction Act dramatically [increases Nvidia's tax liability](https://tax.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CAMT-estimate.pdf) starting in 2023, due to a new 15% Corporate AMT. Nvidia has paid 1.9% effective tax or less in recent years, even having a negative annual tax (-$0.187B) for 2022. Among the lowest in the S&P 100.
* Revenue & earnings have been going down significantly while operating expenses are rising. From their most recent Q4 earnings:

|Revenue|\-21%|
|:-|:-|
|Expenses|\+27%|
|Gross Margin|\-2.1 pts|
|Operating Expenses|\+50%|
|Operating Income|\-58%|
|Net Income|\-53%|
|Cashflow from Operations|\-55%|
|Free Cash Flow YoY|\-53%|

Even if the bullish analysts forecasted revenue growth projections (\~18-20%) for 2023 became true, Nvidia will not make more revenue in 2023 than they did in 2021. Let alone earnings, due to increased operating expenses and taxes.

* High rates act against spending growth, and make the equity-risk premium less attractive as bond become a viable alternative.
* Failing banks in the tech (Silicon Valley Bank) & crypto (Silvergate) space disproportionately impact their primary customer base. Lack of available capital in growth tech point towards a reduction in spending.",t3_11ou0ve,1678566449.0,7

I go over how I was able to contribute so much in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/105u1sp/all_common_tax_advantaged_accounts_maxed_out_what/) post, but the TL;DR is:

* Combination of utilizing Mega Backdoor Roth + Backdoor Roth strategies to contribute $70k+/yr

From there it's been a few plays to get that much in earnings. The two most notable/well documented are:

1) Puts on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100. [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11bkago/22_50000_of_my_401k_into_sept_15_puts/)

2) VIX calls for +$125,000 profit. [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11nttqc/update_22_closed_out_vix_calls_for_125000_gain_in/)

edit: downvote if you want, but the max contribution per annum in an IRA account is $6,000. It is $20,500 for a 401k. The 401k contribution max was also increased in 2023 to $22,500.",t3_11ou0ve,1678569727.0,19

I don't even believe this fucking kid, it's definitely daddy's money. However, if he's 22 and has maxed out his 401K contributions using the IRS cap since he turned 18 he could accumulate the total amount he's talking about with the right growth and probable employer contributions.

It's highly likely that he earns much more than you do so you also probably aren't aware of how to accumulate retirement monies outside of the normal Dave Ramsey shit your wife's boyfriend listens to while he drives you to school. So you aren't accounting for the fact that he could easily reach this account balance in 2-3 years by using his normal contribution cap and then contributing to his after-tax 401K portion up to the ERISA allowed total deposit cap of $66,500 (2023 limit, steps up some each year just like the IRA and 401K).

There's a plethora of ways for this fuckstick to reach the balances he has here but all of you broke mother fuckers don't know what having more than 20K in a robinhood account is so you wouldn't be aware of that.

The whole point of crypto was to have online cash and to replace banks as middlemen. I believe that's possible, but not with how crypto's built now. Crypto's too volatile right now, I think there are many ways people can go about making a crypto that's more stable, like the US dollar, but doesn't lose value to inflation unlike the dollar. We had NFTs, then Crypto, and now AI. It's just like the dot com bubble, all of these technologies (even NFTs, but definitely to a much lesser extent LOL) will be important, just like online business was during the early 2000s. However, just like with every emerging technology it takes time for it to cement itself and actually prove instrumental. The internet was around since the late 80s early 90s in the US and online commerce began around that time, but it wasn't until over 20 years later that it became as big as it is now.

Thump a melon with your finger.  If it sounds hollow, that's your one.  If it has too much water it will have a  solid thump.  If its ripe & sweet it would have out grown its water content & will have created a void, hence the hollow sound.  When you hear it, you will feel it in your loins.

2731,jp1ugo1,t1_jou9mja,"Yes, AI can potentially help in picking out a ripe watermelon. While traditionally, the selection of a ripe watermelon relies on visual inspection and tapping techniques, AI can enhance the process by analyzing various factors and providing a more accurate assessment.

Here's an example of how AI could assist in picking a ripe watermelon:

Image Analysis: AI can analyze images of watermelons to identify visual cues that indicate ripeness. It can detect color changes, such as a yellowish spot on the underside of the melon, which suggests it is ripe. AI algorithms can be trained on a large dataset of watermelon images to learn these patterns.

Acoustic Analysis: By using microphones or specialized sensors, AI can analyze the sound produced when tapping a watermelon. Ripe watermelons typically produce a deep, hollow sound, while unripe ones may sound dull. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize these audio patterns and determine ripeness.

Data Integration: AI can combine information from various sources, such as visual analysis, tapping sounds, and even data on external factors like temperature, humidity, and time since harvest. By considering all these variables, AI can generate a more accurate assessment of watermelon ripeness.

Mobile Apps or Devices: AI-powered mobile apps or devices equipped with sensors could be developed to assist consumers in picking ripe watermelons. Users can take a photo or tap the watermelon, and the AI algorithm running on the app or device can quickly analyze the data and provide feedback on ripeness.

It's important to note that while AI can provide assistance, the final judgment on ripeness may still require human intuition and experience. AI technology can serve as a helpful tool to augment the selection process and improve accuracy, but it may not be infallible and can have limitations.",t3_14ecycu,1687405900.0,1

Well, Jensen does have a bit of a tendency to be facetious. CPU workloads aren't going away. GPUs are too complicated for many things that CPUs do. It is like saying that since the chainsaw exists, hence the knife industry is going to die.

And anyway, most of the software that realistically benefitted the most from GPUs has already shifted to GPU accelerated workloads many years ago. That market is still buying Intel CPUs however, because a GPU can't run most of the general purpose compute that a CPU can or uses a lot more programming time to do so.

And before you say that new ""tools"" are going to make it easier. It isn't. The architecture of a GPU means that it is more difficult to interface with.

\> I work in the industry and I can‚Äôt express how much more desirable and competitive Nvidia positions are than either company 

I highly doubt that, considering that Nvidia sells accelerators. In simpler terms, it ""accelerates"" some workload. A GPU still needs a CPU to work.

\> Not in the near future though. Maybe 5-6 years. And NVDA could always just make another leap forward to stall it 

AMD and Intel don't lag behind because they make less capable products. They lag behind Nvidia has a very nice ecosystem with CUDA. Heck, on raw compute, Nvidia usually is beat by AMD.

What seems more likely to me is that as the market grows, Microsoft or Google or someone will throw their weight behind an open API for general purpose compute because they are going to pay through the nose for Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia will still be competitive, but not the only place in town as Intel and AMD are already established players. And it seems that is kind of happening:

Second, the amount of existing software for ARM is nowhere close to what x96 has. Even apple, 3 years out from it's transition to ARM, hasn't gotten a lot of critical x86 software. And that is in best case scenario.

Third, IT always plans for niche uses. So even if Ampere does 80% of the stuff as well as x86, it still doesn't matter, because it can't do 20% of all the workload assigned to it. Only companies that can be bothered to have Ampere CPUs are either cloud providers(which already design their own chips now) or large companies with large number of servers which can handle individual services(most of which has ironically transitioned to cloud compute)

The timing roughly makes sense, since they borrowed the technology for Intel 4 from largely the previous 7nm+.

Considering the modularity changes and HDL addition in Intel 3 that they are making, they will probably have a good chance to kick off IFS 2 before the end of the year.

3139,jlo742j,t1_jlnykry,"TLDR of poor tangential writing:

1. Sat on desktop/laptop/server chip laurels due to lack of competition from AMD around 2012-2017ish. Got complacent/unlucky on their fabrication process of 10nm(which competes with TSMC 7nm, and got overtaken by both TSMC and even Samsung). Problems could have been reduced by diversifying the company into separate design and fab operations open to work with others so shortcoming of 1 dont allow for loss of the value of both systems which are separated in every other chip company. 

2. Had MBA as CEO when other companies were running with engineer CEOs, which might have meant short term thinking in extracting maximum profit while the sun shone but no focus on the problems bubbling under the surface.

3. Are very late into GPUs even though they have been making integrated GPUs(iGPUs) to run the screens GUI on laptops for a decade. Thus having missed out on crypto craze when GPUs were going for 4x their MSRP. AMD and NVIDIA also benefited atleast a little from this coke binge of a phenomenon. Also missed out on the actual/stock hyping capabilities of being an AI processor company(slightly modified GPUs basically) like NVIDIA has cornered almost and AMD gets leftovers out of.

All conjecture ofcourse. 



Garbage story time. 

Tried to get into the smartphone game late, could have even gotten a piece of the pie if they actually made some good phone chips. Intels moat is x86 that it has to share with AMD. The software like windows & used to be macOS that used to only run on x86, stagnated, or even straight up migrated to ARM. x86 is still their moat,but fewer and fewer people even want to get in, as the castle next door at ARM is much better, customisable, energy efficient and generally open.

AMD had beaten INTEL to 64 bit and multi core(2core cpu) but fumbled the bag as Intel soon recovered in the next 5 years leaving AMD dead in the forest. AMD had bet on higher core counts (8 core) to scale performance to the next level whilst keeping costs down. This was a dumpster fire of an execution(ahead of their time concepts in a way) which when AMD was in the shitter, amd sold off their foundry into Global foundries to survive the 2010ish times. This was the clear strategy amongst all chip companies to ditch fabrication and outsource it to the specialists. AMD was among the last to take this strategy when they had no other choice basically. Intel being high on their success at dominating AMD and having a massive legacy felt they were the only real deal company in the space with their own fabs(REAL MEN HAVE THEIR OWN FABS thinking). They enjoyed a good almost decade of absolute dominance in laptops,desktops, servers, but were getting FOMO rightly so, at being left behind in mobile chips. They didn't push hard in their dominance areas as they didn't need to(they didn't have competition- no companies don't just plan to be good or bad, but complacency in more relaxed timelines probably has an effect on slacking when you're winning the race). Most of their effort went into mobile and they bombed hard again and again for 5 years or so from 2010 to 2015ish in the mobile space since at this time phone chips were a league behind laptops or desktop chips, and they always started from their own perceived superior strategy of making big hefty CPUs that had some real performance like a real man, but didn't matter for shit when phone batteries could only power these inefficient cpus (compared to the ARM chips of the time) and ended up running even worse performance a lot of the times when the power budgets were kept inline with ARM chips were taking(ARM chips designed by the likes of Qualcomm,mediatek and later apple)

By this time AMD had woken up from their death with their aptly named RYZEN CPUs which featured chiplet designs which allowed for much cheaper ways to get to massive amounts of cores. Even their non chiplet CPUs had more cores than Intel had been stuck on for 5 years. Intel held on for 2-3 more years as people finally started buying AMD again (lack of availability of AMD laptops and server CPU order take time and trust to shift,nobody was going to get fired buying Intel, but might be taking risks with AMD for the higher reward(better performance for money)).

They have just now in 2023 roughly caught upto AMD where they are competing for the better chip every year, but you can't go too wrong buying either one. In response to the AMD revival in 2017-18, they had started cutting selling costs and adding cores by 2018 itself but within the next 2-3 years by 2020 ish it became apparent they were bruteforcing. By the time their stock tanked to be an Evel lower market cap than amd,a much smaller company by revenue, they kicked out the money counting ceo and put in an engineer,hoping someone with a clue as to what's actually going on can focus on the basics. He did do all that, refresh branding, get into GPUs, spin off the fab as a separate market fab open to all. They got some tiny external business from their fabs being opened to all,but nothing of not yet, as they are still in the leading edge region so not cheap, but a clear 3rd compared to tsmc and samsung, so they don't get good orders there either. None the less, it is a good strategy long term of becoming more nimble. They also got a big rimjob from the US govt in the form of the CHIPS act where they collected billions like a stripper collects 1s. But so did everyone else. Their GPUs were alright on price to consumers but they arent making money on the investment just yet as they haven't made a great product and are being forced to rely on undercutting the competition. They also completely missed out on the crypto hysteria by a few months, launching the product just when GPUs were being flooded into the market by crypto miners. 

Chiplet design (2 chips talking to each other over a pcb. data transfer speeds within a chip are blazing fast, but once you get off the bullet train complex(Silicon chip) to catch the connecting bus(copper wiring on a PCB) to reach the other bullet train complex(chiplet 2 ))this is beneficial as at the kinds of complex small scale fabrication that are used in bleeding edge nodes these days, the margin for error can be larger(100 errors in 1 billion vs 300 errors in 1 billion) this is because if each chip is made of 2 smaller chiplets, a smaller portion of the error heavy silicon has to be thrown away(or sold as entry level chips with half the cores turned off since they had errors in printing)

3151,jlqphph,t1_jlql07f,"Semis are really weird. Where it‚Äôs going on depends on what happens with the fabs. TSMC is the unparalleled king. TSMC is why AMD beat Intel, Intel really dropped the ball on their fab business.

And now Apple and Nvidia went all in on TSMC, AMD is finding a hard time getting any time at all on the N3 and N4 nodes, they‚Äôre now going to Samsung partially. Not because of Nvidia, but because of Apple. Apple absolutely maxes out how much money you can make per wafer, so their bids are hard to keep up with. I think NVDA will struggle with this too soon, they‚Äôre not using N3 yet.

3152,jlqo833,t1_jlql07f,"Obviously I am biased towards NVDA, look at my username. But I think the bias is due to my research and understanding.

It is unlikely AMD is involved with Athena, at best they may be loosely consulting. Custom chip design is usually done by a company like broadcom that has experience with ASICs.

It‚Äôs just really, really false that AMD has an advantage in AI, so I was taken aback. They never focused on AI, or even GPUs for that matter, and went all in on CPUs. Which they did a great job on. Nvidia on the other hand has had full-time teams writing deep learning compilers and writing CUDA backends for popular AI/machine learning frameworks, as well as developing their own AIs. That‚Äôs like a decade of work.

There is just so many headwinds for AMD, it would be too much to list them all. They‚Äôll announce a bunch of AI initiatives so the hype from that may keep the stock up.",t3_13rp7wn,1685131950.0,1
3153,jlryxpd,t1_jlpv17d,"8th gen & 9th gen & 10th gen were all completely or partially 14nm. And yet they were miles ahead of 7th gen(14nm vs 14nm the last pre ryzen peak complacency).

An i7 7500u laptop was 2 cores.

Not updating the design that has to go onto the newer lithography, only causes delays. You have to test the designs on the new lithography, and optimise both. They had 10nm issues for sure and they didn't just do it out of laziness as I already stated in my comment. But a lack of haste introduces slower and slower time scales. They still pushed out a shoddy 10nm when push came to shove, I bet it would have been pushed out shoddy by 1-2 years earlier if they had competition. It wouldn't magically make the issues go away, but having a fire around them to atleast shortfix problems the best they could would have expedited the process. 

The issues aren't completely processized where you go through x, y, z steps to solve the problems. Having to fight against time forces you to constantly think about the issues. Might not be great for employee stress but it shows in outputs (not always but often)

Plus a big issue besides the big jump in EUV process that 10nm was, was that Intel had gone for the grand approach instead of slow constant progress, what tsmc has recently shown is kind of the winning strategy to constantly deliver incremental upgrades everywhere.

I kind of hate this line of thinking since it's such a contrarian reason, Intel slacking was a common take on the internet , which then became Acxtually you guys are just consumer gamers, you don't know they had issues with 10nm. Guess what, so did Samsung and tsmc I imagine, and maybe Intel's problems were bigger, but in the industry time and time again first to market strategy of incremental upgrades wins.

Don't want to come across shitty but it's kinda irritating take to me, since I'm sure you knew everything I said as has been stated multiple times on the internet, and Ive read your reasoning on the threads before.",t3_13rp7wn,1685154011.0,1

3156,jlqpvxz,t1_jlqo833,"Yep Microsoft came out and said they‚Äôre not involved with AMD on Athena but didn‚Äôt deny the added funds for research of AI on other chips.

Ahhh ok I see the misunderstanding, I‚Äôm not saying they have an advantage in AI over NVIDIA, AMD are playing catch-up right now NVIDIA is definitely the flag holder for that.
The advantage would be if Microsoft chose only AMD AI chips over NVIDIA in the future (which I heard would be purely based on the fact AMD produces significantly cheaper chips), but that‚Äôs speculation with no 100% confirmed info.

I‚Äôve heard a lot about the strength of CUDA, are NVIDIA still investing more into their Grace CPU and ARM system to provide a dual GPU? I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions on it",t3_13rp7wn,1685132672.0,1
3157,jlrwc1m,t1_jlqpvxz,"AMD GPUs are cheaper because they are less reliable and they have much less datacenter experience. So everything is relative. If you buy a server farm and bring up takes 3-6 months, that‚Äôs already 5-10% of the product lifecycle. So that company has to offer their products cheaper. This is not to mention the performance differential.

AMD has lower profit margins than Nvidia. Cost to produce doesn‚Äôt factor in to the price all that much. Every customer gets a custom price (in the B2B business). So nvidia charges more be because they can (they add real value), whereas Amd has to charge less because nobody would buy AMD at the same price as nvidia. That‚Äôs a fine strategy to keep the business going and grow the ecosystem while they improve their product, this is what they did with CPUs.

For the record I own some amount of AMD too, partially as a hedge partially because I like them a lot. Also NVDA and AMD tickers tend to follow each other anyway.",t3_13rp7wn,1685152648.0,1
3158,jlrzxqx,t1_jlrwc1m,"I do agree they have significantly less data centre experience, when it comes to reliability I have a 5700XT that has done a great job for me for  quite a few years and I hear from most other users they‚Äôve significantly improved from previous generations. How reliable it is for more intense uses like data centres I‚Äôm not sure about.

Their pricing model is definitely due to the fact there‚Äôs no other company that is on the same level for GPUs, NVIDIA have a bad reputation in the PC world because of their prices and more people side with AMD because of it, which is why I can see Microsoft making that same decision if AMD come out with hardware that matches NVIDIAs

I kinda wanted to get into NVIDIA too because at the end of the day both are very good companies, (except intel I‚Äôve been laughing at them this entire run) but now I gotta wait for the recession crash to hit and join up then",t3_13rp7wn,1685154546.0,1

The new specification they are working with have the first generation of data cable pins on the power connectors:  and they fucking suck cuz they are so flimsy that they released a liability statement saying you are only guaranteed so many plugs/unplugs before failure.  The crypto mining crash has crippled their whales that they nurtured at the expense of the rest of us, likely will not recover any time soon.  They also mistreated EVGA business partners to the point of EVGA reorganising so they never have to work with nVidia ever again.  Finally, they were just an unethical company to begin with:  they patented so much code and applications of the technology that other brands aren't allowed to make even remotely similar rendering techniques without being sued up the ass.

Really, *a single chart* with one indicator and one general thought about it? I thought this was the kinda shit we're all doing - using indicators and studies on charts and depending on what it looks like, make trade decisions for ourselves like ""maybe puts on NVDA is a good play""


But to post that in WSB, just one time frame and basically ""looks like it should go down, I'll say time for puts"" = 1000+ upvotes? 


There are so many other stocks whose chart looks exactly like this, and any given day of the week, any handful of stocks look either like this, or seemingly bullish. 


And even then, one time frame, like 30 minutes candles, could look like this, then one day candles or week candles could indicate the exact opposite, and a single chart like this doesn't take that into account at all.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_(finance)

Really interesting excerpt from the Momentum article IMO:

>The existence of momentum is a market anomaly, which finance theory struggles to explain. The difficulty is that an increase in asset prices, in and of itself, should not warrant further increase. Such increase, according to the efficient-market hypothesis, is warranted only by changes in demand and supply or new information (cf. fundamental analysis). Students of financial economics have largely attributed the appearance of momentum to cognitive biases, which belong in the realm of behavioral economics. The explanation is that investors are irrational,[4][5] in that they underreact to new information by failing to incorporate news in their transaction prices. However, much as in the case of price bubbles, other research has argued that momentum can be observed even with perfectly rational traders.[6]

From what I can tell this is essentially saying: We don't know why momentum matters, but it objectively does. The most likely case is simply due to human cognitive bias, but we really have nothing concrete beyond that.",t3_zv4hdh,1672020105.0,73

""While I cannot predict future market movements or specific events, there are several factors that could potentially trigger a repricing of a stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) if it is considered overvalued:

1. Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.
2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.
3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.
4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.
5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.
6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.
7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.

It's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing. It is always a good idea to do thorough research, stay informed about market developments, and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions.""",t3_11zvsca,1679613816.0,1

3) there have already been significant improvements towards reducing computing need for model training vs earlier iterations (see Chinchilla scaling law for example, indicating a model better performing than GPT3 could be trained using 65% less compute intensity).

4054,jdikqj3,t1_jdg438c,"According to nasdaq . com, the stock is worth about $0.16 per year, since that's what it pays in dividend.

A stock's intrinsic value comes from two things: its dividend payments and the belief that if the company failed and liquidated all of its assets, you would get a portion of that money based on how many shares you own.

Otherwise, a stock's price functions exactly like a Ponzi scheme.  You need more people to keep putting more money into it for the value to increase.

To add to this, since the company pays about 0.06% dividend per year, if you bought the stock right now and the price stayed flat forever, you'd need about 115 years to double your wealth.

But since logic currently tells us that the stock is way over-valued, if you buy right now and the price drops over time, you will almost certainly never recoup your losses through dividends.

I think chatgpt and this weird portion of llms is essentially email. Like we are at the very very start of the entire scope of internet. 

I'm not saying ai is going to run the world but more than likely these things will be in everything. We say chatgpt because what else is there to point at? But the reality is these things are phenomenal. The hype in Nvidia stock price? On the short term horizon? Yeah sure, who knows. But imo we are in the logging into aol to check email once a week phase of the story. Who knows where it will go but it would have been impossible to predict the current situation of every device now connected to a magic wireless system of information.

Not saying for investing, but just in general. These llms are almost certainly going to break the system. There is research pouring out and I firmly believe that we are approaching the global understanding that what we thought was intelligence, consciousness, etc isn't some magical thing... it's just a certain level of input information being composed as output. I feel fairly confident that the definition of general ai is flawed at any level as our brains arbitrarily grasp at things we can do that llms can't. I don't think general ai or a thinking robot will ever be created, I think they're essentially already here. They're just really really smart 8 year olds basically. If chatgpt is just making words in a particular order in an attempt to pretend to think, then what am I doing everyday? Seems pretty similar imo.

Curious about your view on this, but where do your thoughts come from? What makes your idea yours? If you were never told that English existed, you wouldn't think in English. If you weren't painstakingly taught by someone over many years, you wouldn't know anything, your mind would be exceptionally powerful, but applied deeply to some natural elements and the winds rather than blue light and keyboards. In that world, would your thoughts originate within you or are they a result of the feeling of your senses firing from the long grass you walk through?

At what point do we begin making original thoughts? Have we ever truly had one? 

I'm of the position that every connection we make is mundane, there is stark contrast between our perception and truthful reality.  We can get very drunk and barely perceive time or control our bodies but then when we are sober we feel that we command every action, every statement. 

But what if the human experience was flawed? What if despite our own feelings and day to day interaction with our world,  we are unable to see the simplicity of how unintelligent our brains are? What if we are missing critical sensory organs required for real intelligence, if every other intelligent being in the universe has trifurcated lobes in their brains and our brains are incapable? What if we are npcs in the 4th dimensional space of true intellect?

We have an idea of intelligence and we base it on our own perception. I'm smarter than Bob but not as smart as Alice. But what about true intelligence? What if beyond the scope of our feeble skull sized minds there is a larger scale? One where humans brains are not even infinitesimal let alone infantile. What qualifies us to set rules for what thinks and what doesn't? To state what is real intelligence and what is pretending?

4387,jm8vfi1,t1_jm7uwea,"I believe that the kind of ASICs you are referring to will be problematic for many companies and applications even when AI matures and company requirements become more specific because they are so costly (a cheap single ASIC design can cost millions of dollars if not $100M+ just to *design*) and then the lifetime to recover those expenses might only be a few years before the H/W is obsolete.

AI also needs flexibility almost by definition.  Weights need to be updated over time and neural networks need to learn, adapt, and evolve during deployment.  The part that requires the most compute for a lot of AI/ML is the training while the network is adapting its internal parameters and often different architectures are being searched over and jointly optimized while different approaches to training are being tried.  It requires a lot of flexible programming and ability to change cost/loss functions, hyperparameters, architectures, signal/image processing of inputs, and so on, which is hardly ideal for ASICs.

Not sayin there won‚Äôt be places for ASICs or that they won‚Äôt even grow, especially if the cost to design can be brought down significantly.  I just don‚Äôt see ASICs being a threat to NVIDIA.  

Heck, a GPU really is sort of like a specific kind of ASIC that deviates a little in that it is flexible enough to perform almost any kind of matrix operation.  If you wanted to build an ASIC that didn‚Äôt only work for a single specific matrix problem and wanted it a little more general you‚Äôd end up designing a GPU, no?",t3_13vqlrq,1685477075.0,2

However they also were bad at keeping drivers updated. They would release some driver then call it a day.

Theoretically yes, but the drivers provided by Nvidia don't work ""out of the box"" like AMD drivers in all cases - particularly when using newer Display Servers like Wayland.  Had tons of issues getting non-free Nvidia drivers to work properly myself - adding kernel mode settings, installing a ton of compatibility packages, etc.  Using an AMD card you just gotta plug it in and reboot.

Right this second is the Nvidia GTC meeting. It's been going on all week.  All you have to do is look at who is attending those meetings and what they're selling.  AI/ML and advanced compute. Yea yea, little billy can play the latest AAA game on 8k resolution but that is the small shit to keep you in the dumpster behind Wendys.

The real story is who are at these meetings, how many industry leaders and government representatives are there? Spoiler alert, system integrators that develop shipping, defense, geospatial, etc solutions. And all that stuff is only getting better with Machine Learning. Nvidia knows this and that is why they're not really selling to people that buy a 3060Ti so they can play burger flipping simulator. They sell to people that buy BUILDINGS full of A550s because they need to do crazy deep learning shit.

There are few semiconductor manufacturers that can accommodate nvidia, and their margin is directly impacted by how much they charge for production.

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days.

6195,j8b2834,t3_110mkdo,"NVDA: Too late.  Priced in already.  

TSMC: Way too much geopolitical risk.  

ASML: Too hard a limit on the quantities they can produce.  Making ultra-precise instruments with a workforce of Ph.D's and engineers is cool, but if your machines get more popular you can only sell to whomever the US gov has blessed.  

Intel has been trying to stop their slipping lately, I think AMD's server strategy and ease of installation is going to keep paying off.  Rumors are Intel loses a major client if they are late in their next server launch, and guess what they usually do when it comes to time management?

6739,j7g6fjr,t1_j7g0y6y,"that sounds like a small a rather niche market

also: isn‚Äôt advanced enough ‚Äúyet‚Äù

that said, I have no idea about Chegg. 7-8 years ago most international students I knew in Canada used local premium essay writers with some awareness of Chinese ESL and a capacity to write believable (from a mainland student in Canada 3-4 years) and very fast (overnight delivery) B+ essays 

the premium was paid for a service 

I would imagine Chegg needs to rely on more than ‚Äòengineering homework help‚Äô but maybe more personalized tutoring or basic product services such as textbook rentals 

i wouldn‚Äôt be especially long in any education services though as i think AI in general is going to reshape how we teach and test students. it‚Äôs hard to offer a service for an environment if you don‚Äôt know how the environment will look in 10 years.

context: i was an essay writer for years a long time ago. made a lot of money on it. knew a few guys that did too and one guy with a company in china that got pretty rich off it. i probably couldn‚Äôt do it now. most of my old consumer segment (rich chinese students) seem to all use chatgpt now.",t3_10v8lvq,1675698805.0,12

They essentially do highest probability next token prediction in LLMs... they're never going to learn the process for even simple addition of many tokens.  For any of these LLMs, try asking them to add 20 random integers, let's even limit them to be between 1 and 100.  They all fall flat on their faces and always will.  To see why, just do the combinations 100 choose 1 + 100 choose 1+... twenty times right.  The chances of that set of numbers in the summation being in the training data goes to zero.  That's why these models can guess two operand sums but start struggling really fast as the number of operands increases.  They don't know how to add.  When they show these models doing things like passing the Bar exam or med school exams... remember that there are oodles of example questions for these online.  Yeah, not identical to the new question, but pretty darn close so you can basically just format the answer the same way and get close enough on enough of them to pass.  This generalizes well enough from training to validation data per se... but to go from training to test is another story.  E.g. when I come up with my own super simple logic questions (seating assignment logic puzzles)... ChatGPT fails hard... and they were super super simple ones with just 3 seats.  It's also shit at tic tac toe, a simple solved game where the entire ideal moveset fits in a single XKCD strip.  LLMs are much less impressive than people realize.

I \*looks\* like it ""learns"" things, but all it really does is next token prediction.  That is fundamentally different from e.g. calculation, as has been discussed in the context of how ChatGPT is bad at math.  It's also fundamentally different from logic and context... and that is a bit less easy to solve than bolting on Wolfram Alpha.  These models are heavily linked with their training data and face similar issues with generalizing that the computer vision models for driving do.  It will become more apparent to you as you use the models more.  You will find yourself spending more and more time checking the model outputs... to the point where it takes more time to check what the model spat out than to just do it right yourself from the start.  Sooner or later people are going to realize that this isn't changing the world, it's not going to change much of anything... maybe search just a little bit, but not even that much.

How is it supposed to ""strategize"" without being able to solve simple seating problems?  It literally can't.""Do you actually work with them?"" Machine learning models generally, yes.  LLMs in particular, hell no, they're very much not appropriate for what I do.  Not that I don't have colleagues high on the hype train.  They'll come down from it eventually, they're always hyped like that over the newest models and they regularly fail to outperform old techniques in my area.  Freaking XGboost is failing to outperform simple heuristics in my field.  Not on training data, beautiful there, loss heads right for zero.  Not on validation data, you do parameter tuning and you'll find something that generalizes well to that.  But moving to from validation to real world testing in independent data... performance drops below that of the heuristic.  I'm only picking on ChatGPT this much because the hype is so high.  Several of the issues and reasons it isn't going to ""change everything"" are general to ML models, and just modeling in general.  More recent ML models also fail to outperform decades old Markov Chain models on other problems in my field.  And again, yes, they can do it on a data set, and often on an author's chosen validation set, but you take them to the real world on independent data and watch them faceplant.

lol you would be generating one word *per day* on a 2008 era processor. I'm not even joking.

Right now, it's difficult to run models 1/10 the size of ChatGPT on Intel/AMD CPUs. They run, provided you have enough RAM, but they are still super slow. 

It's slightly more manageable with Apple's M1/M2 processors and the speed up is 5x to 10x, see https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp, but ram is still a bottleneck.",t3_13v44jm,1685446048.0,3

It means you can offer cheaper/free AI driven services that are faster. Not to mention offload a bunch of the calculations onto devices without draining the battery.

you got too lazy off of your imperialist activities, exploiting free labour, stealing other countries' resources, looting, taxing your subject countries, etc. etc...that you didn't have to be innovative and actually work hard yourselves.

your country basically got a huge leg up and became wealthy due to your colonialism. this is what made you the financial centre of the world at that time.

britain is a country that is very much stuck in its ways, is not dynamic, fast-moving, etc..the fact that you still revere the royal family and subsidise their luxurious existence and ideas of aristocracy shows that you're still too ""comfortable"" and set in your ways and not wanting to embrace change (for the better). there is an idealisation of the notion of wanting to be treated like a celebrity, kick your feet up and relax at other people's expense, whilst you do next to nothing. might explain the proliferation of so many reality tv shows in britain too. everyone wants to become a flipping 'celebrity' and we use that term loosely. deeply set racist attitudes don't help because if you look at who heads a lot of these top-tier US companies, they're people who are immigrants. steve jobs was half syrian, etc...

the fact that you voted to exit the EU also shows that you're not willing to cooperate, collaborate, learn, exchange and want to be isolationist. might also show that you have a superiority complex and that attitude does no-one any favours. you don't evolve without any outside input and perspectives.

also having tory conservative governments consecutively is not conducive to growth and evolution. they basically want to keep the power in the hands of people who already have it and keep expenditure at the lowest which means not spending money on anything.

Juggernaut companies aren't just a matter of a strong education pipeline though... I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  

The US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.  And as far as I can tell from a quick search, that was upheld when it came to Uber as well: 

""**Uber now treats all 70,000 of its drivers in Britain as ‚Äúworkers‚Äù**  entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension plans. It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021"" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)

It's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    


Likewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.  Mega companies require political buy in to have favorable policies and procedures through regulatory capture.  More robust political involvement and stronger regulatory authority and independence would be expected to put a damper on such massive enterprises.",t3_141wtt4,1686038891.0,1

The FTSE finally got back on trend in Q4 2009 and did well over the next few years, but it's been completely stagnant since mid-2017.

Again, at the risk of getting downvoted to buggery, it's a combination of Brexit and just a seemingly endless charade of utterly crappy governments, all of which we've inflicted on ourselves.

Walk around your average town in the UK and you can see the effects everywhere: loads of empty premises, crappy infrastructure, local services being cut, cost of living going through the roof.

strictly speaking this isn't quite true - it really depends on how you define best. If your metric is average starting salary out of college, British Universities are woefully behind American ones. This means the best and brightest don't have much of an incentive to stay in Britain. For context, I work for an American firm and our starting salaries for new grads in our London office is so far ahead of what British firms in our industry would pay that it makes it super easy to acquire and retain talent, even though we're just paying british new grads the same amount as american new grads

The stench of failure is baked-in to our society at this point:

\- Wealth is centralised in London, where space is extremely expensive. If you relocate somewhere cheaper you pay the price in worse access to talent and infrastructure. If you choose to stay in London, a fair amount of your revenue gets syphoned-off by Saudi landlords who own the commercial space.

\- If you're growing a small business from scratch, it's quite tough to keep ahold of your profits. If you have a good quarter/year, you're inevitably stung with a huge amount of tax, which makes expansion difficult. As a result, a lot of businesses never grow past the point of being glorified cottage industries.

\- Class absolutely has a terrible impact on how money gets allocated. Both through inept posh people squandering investment, or state-schooled talent (the type who might thrive in America) being denied it due to the networks they'll never be able to access. Good luck getting a business loan from a bank.

\- Another thing is the overall attitude towards succeeding. Many companies pay garbage salaries and also often expect to extract a product or service from a supplier for free/low rate. They genuinely see you making profit as being greedy, whereas in America it's expected. This feeds into the class issue again, where many jobs that would be well-paid in the US, are essentially a hotbed of people who can afford to work for next-to-nothing and can play this game for years until they land the most prestigious opportunities.

\- Low salaries keep people trapped in employment. Higher salaries would allow people to invest in their own firms - ""starting your own Apple from your garage"" but salaries haven't even kept pace with inflation.

That's not to say no one works hard in any other country, but one of the main reasons that every other country views us as a bunch of pieces of shit is because our lives are consumed by work, and we don't put as much weight (no pun intended) into anything else. Especially in coastal areas where, for whatever reason, the ""pace"" of things is psychotically fast. That alone drives innovation.

Meaning that the UK had essentially hit peak industrial growth before the start of ww2 and was buyoed by the large trade benefits from colonies. This would result in post ww2, the repair of infrastructure and industrial plants, and the move away from war-time industy. Come to think of it, you would think, that had the British been able to spend like America did in public-private (military) post ww2 instead of focusing on recovery; that the tech innovations made during wartime could've been helped by a military industrial complex like the U.S. during the Cold War. I think the large being military expenditures post-war by the U.S., allowed said innovations to spur companies like Boeing, etc. And then years later silicon Valley.

The UK ebbed into the service industries extremely post Marshall Plan recovery before, and even more so after, they hit stagnation for the better part of the late 70's. Who knows, I think part of it is that the UK industrial base was also heavily dependent on overseas colonies pre ww2 (cheaper and.more plentiful access to raw.materials). Meaning that the UK had essentially hit peak industrial growth before the start of ww2 and was buyoed by the large trade benefits from colonies. This would result in post ww2, the repair of infrastructure and industrial plants, and the move away from war-time industy. Come to think of it, you would think, that had the British been able to spend like America did in public-private (military) post ww2 instead of focusing on recovery; that the tech innovations made during wartime could've been helped by a military industrial complex like the U.S. during the Cold War.

This post is turning into a book, lol:

So one thing that makes Silicon Valley different is that a lot of VCs are former founders (or early employees) of successful startups.  So there's this critical mass of institutional knowledge about both how to run a startup and how to pick startups to invest in.  It creates this cycle where each round of founders funds the next an encourages them to dream big and go public in a spectacular IPO.

I think another factor is the lack of the class system, so founders think it completely reasonable to give early employees (the peasants) significant stock.  Money isn't everything, but almost everyone prefers to have more money than less, and having stock that *might* be worth $10M one day motivates some people.  So the best talent comes to Silicon Valley and you get a critical mass of the actual labor to make that happen (which makes hiring for a startup easier).  That talent comes from many places, among them Cambridge.

**But probably the most important part** is that it's ok to fail.  Startups fail all. the. fucking. time. in SV.  It's not unusual for a senior SWE to have 5 defunct startups on his/her resume, and interviewers don't see that as a negative.  At least they had the balls to go for it.  Same thing for founders, when they're pitching their latest thing to VCs.   

Ending a startup isn't a big deal, either.  You lay off all the staff[1], sell the office stuff and move on.  You don't have to give employees six months notice for each week they worked at the company.

Contrast that with Europe, where running a company that closed or went bankrupt is a big fucking deal.  I've heard horror stories about founders getting blacklisted after one unsuccessful startup.  And not just from VCs, but from other jobs and their own bank.  People aren't going to take risks if the consequences of failure are that high.

In other words, the ""environment"" in Europe is just all wrong if you want to have companies that are the result of big risky bets on unproven technology.

[1] They're working for a startup, so they already know there's a 90% chance of that happening when they sign up.

moreover, the US has always had an anti-communist agenda (like strangely obsessive). i guess it's because communism is the antithesis of extreme capitalism which represents the USA. it is because of this agenda, they try and smear china as much as possible. US and western mainstream media tries to paint china out as a smoggy, grey, miserable, authoritarian dystopia. it takes me watching a couple of vlogs by foreigners in china going about their everyday business to realise that the western propaganda machine is in full force when it comes to their negatively biased narrative towards china. thankfully, a lot more foreigners from a variety of countries working and living in china are exposing western lies.

an anti-commie US thinktank even enlisted some random german named adrian zenz (who isn't a china expert because he doesn't  meet basic metrics of being able to speak or read mandarin, nor has he ever been to china) to make up shit about so-called persecuted uighers in xinjiang and alleged genocide. the US agenda is so clear. all of the western MSM has run with this 'story' without any thorough fact-checking.

you know what else a neo-capitalistic country like the US does? it knocks on china's door first in order to ask for permission to move manufacturing there. you did this because increasing profit margins is the only thing that matters to you even if it means your own citizens lose jobs. then you've got the audacity to blame china for your actions.

regarding stealing of IP, it's the typical western trope. if you were so concerned about other countries stealing your IP, why not keep everything in-house? and why not move manufacturing back to the US? it's because you're too drunk on profits from exploiting china's mass labour force and it's a business coupling that is going to be difficult to uncouple from but if you were to do so, it would be more at your loss than china's. china never reached out to the world to do business in the first place. it was the other way round.

regarding demographic, every single developed country in the world is experiencing low fertility rates so if it's a problem for china, then it's an issue for a lot of other countries as well, including yours.",t3_141wtt4,1686046374.0,-3

Welfare state is obviously a question of definition, but many of the New Deal programs and LBJ's 'Great Society' programs sure look a lot like welfare state efforts.

The PIGS countries' economies were crushed mostly by their Euro membership, actually. Their economies have long been less productive than Germany, France etc., but before the Euro, they could compete through debasing the currency. The actual statistics showed that Greeks worked just as many hours as other Europeans.

Also, the deficits they racked up were comparable to what the US did at the time (in a major recession, deficits always increase as the state spends on e.g. unemployment to keep people from starving). Difference was that Greece especially was forced by the ECB, IMF etc. to actually pay instead of claiming bankruptcy, leaving the Euro and letting the banks (who willingly lent them money) share in the fiasco. This led to acute poverty everywhere, and all the young would-be innovators more or less fled the country.

7842,jn2hp54,t1_jn2ctk8,"It's too complicated to *fully* get into here, and this is wonky as hell, but Japan was an inadvertent Ponzi scheme.

Here are critical concepts:

After we laid the most epic beatdown, ever, on Japan we:

1. literally **wrote their Constitution**.
2. Imposed some brutal **sanctions** (Some would rival the Versailles accords - then again, they attacked us, so eat a d\*\*k)
3. Completely Disbanded their military **offensive** capabilities. (They were really uppity in the 20th century - Just ask China. I would bet a testicle China goes after Japan before they ever flinch on Taiwan)

Now, the two individuals (general & prince) in charge of negotiating with general Douglas MacArthur were brilliant. They agreed to the enormous sanctions, but claimed that their country was decimated, the population demoralized, etc. - And so they could only ever hope to repay the debts if we would accept, ""**STORE CREDIT**""

So, literally, the Japanese could pay us in STUFF. And thus began the mega expansion of the Japanese economy. They had a **Guaranteed buyer** \- The US government.

Everything they built; we took as payment for pissing us off at Pearl Harbor. In fact, for around 5 years after the war, **we literally spent 10s of billions (adjust in today $) helping them re-build their factories**, so they would give us more shit, faster. The US was going through the baby boomer, suburban expansion. obvious net result is we fueled massive volume growth in Japanese factories.

Another critical piece that helped catapult them into the stratosphere - We literally banned Japan from spending on offensive military capabilities: bombs, tanks, nukes, etc. And in return, we agreed to ""protect"" them - See: All the US bases in Japan.

Just imagine how much goddamn $ we would save if we never spent a penny on the military and were just cucked by someone else for protection (looking at you Canada!).

And for the cherry on top, throw in the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, which shifted American consumers from gas guzzlers to the toy cars coming out of Japan that Detroit was not ready for, and the rest is history.

Eventually the ""US government put"" ended but Japan did what everyone else in a bubble does - head down, and steam right into oblivion.

PS - There are some systemic issues with how Japanese banks were intertwined with business, which also exacerbated the issue. They are also weirdly isolationist. No foreigners. Part of the reason for their population collapse. Idiots.",t3_141wtt4,1686017247.0,6

We haven't even started reaping returns from the basic M.L. 101 that we've just got like right now tuesday.  (Sorry, can't stand AI, we don't have AI, we've got ML.)  Whatever, it's ramping up now and will accelerate further ramping up which will further accelerate the ramping, and so on.  

But I can give you good non-AI reasons why goes moon... NVDA, ASML, and TSMC have released libraries that cut reticle computation time by a factor of forty.  Used to be over a month, now just a day.  Absolutely massive for turnaround time on chip development.  New DPX instruction set does the same thing for specific computational tasks, like lining up and matching gene sequences.  That means all biotech is theirs, and there will be others too.  And Omniverse is set to be the unified platform for manufacturing and engineering.  All will be simulated from product design to simulating and building the manufacturing facilities, all virtually before laying down a single brick.  In other words, NVidia is undervalued.  I know sweet FA about financials, but I do know my tech.

As for real AI... We'll reach that when we accept the fact that We are large language models.  ;)",t3_13sgght,1685184217.0,1

The risk reduction of diversifying drops quickly after 5-10 stocks and is negligible over 30 stocks. The only advantage of very diverse portfolios (eg S&P500 ETF)) is reduced *short term* volatility.

That being said, the current concentration of gains in the tech sector has a more perverse impact on options trading.  Case in point: I trade options exclusively in SPX because I am trying to eliminate the noise of individual stocks or sectors when I build trades.  What I failed to grasp until this month‚Äôs massive gains is that the concentration of the tech sector made impacts to that sector disproportionately move the index.   My options trades, which I thought were insulated from sector risk, suddenly blew up because the AI mania drove the tech sector to the moon.  Had that not happened, I would have had a record month.  

This isn‚Äôt a concern if you are a long term holder in SPY, as you will benefit from the portfolio effects.  But options, with an expiration date, may be unduly affected.

Personally, my No.1 AI play is GOOG. I believe they've been underappreciated in this whole AI thing. Everybody lost the plot. Thought that GOOG might be in some sort of existential crisis. Even if search was in legitimate danger, it would take YEARS for their moat to unwind. It's not happening overnight. Also, by the time their search business did unwind (if ever), they'd be down from 95 percent dominance to about 65 percent dominance. Sure, that's a big haircut, but we need to remember that Google has been investing heavily into AI since as early as 2011. In 2011 Google created an internal unit known as Google Brain. This was their chief AI unit in the early days. In 2014, they decided to acquire their biggest AI threat at the time, DeepMind. In 2017, Google announced they were ""AI First"", even though it had been that way since at least 2014 unofficially. Also in 2017, Google Brain literally invented the idea of transformer networks. ChatGPT wouldn't have existed without the help of Google engineers coming up with the transformer networks concept.

In late 2022, Sergey Brin and Larry Page came out of semi-retirement to help steward the combination of Google Brain and DeepMind into a singular unit with a singular focus. AGI.

The first to AGI wins everything imo. If this was the Kentucky Derby, I believe GOOG should have 2/1 odds on getting to AGI before anybody else.

Large Language Models are a red herring. Everybody that's going Coo-Coo for Cocoa Puff's over LLM's are missing the plot. Just ask META's chief AI Scientist, Yann LeCunn about LLM's. LLM's are just an easy way to have something that seemingly impressive on the surface level. Google has that with Bard, but that's never been their focus. They're doing the real AI work that is going to really matter longterm. Not flavor of the month type AI shit.

I already know that NVDA is overvalued by about 30 percent right now, but it doesn't matter. There's way too much FOMO for it to have a 30 percent crackback anytime soon. 

Having said that, I'm sure as hell not buying anymore shares right now. It's currently in a no-man's-land imo. Too expensive to buy, but hasn't FOMO'd as much as it will, so probably not the best time to sell either. If you currently own shares, I think you hold till about $485. It might blow past $485 and end up in the $550's heading to $600, but I wouldn't bank on it. I also wouldn't bank on it being $280 very soon.

It's in one of those ranges that you just can't touch.

Diversification would be studying various subtopics within Chemistry or Physics.

Read about Buffet - He got rich with Insurance, more specifically the Insurance Float.

He was the insurance master. And once Berkshire had acquired so much wealth, it became impossible to invest in another insurance company. Any position Buffet would take could equal a majority of the stake of any insurance company.

So, he pivoted and started buying huge conglomerates with records of paying dividends - Example: Coca Cola. Thus began the so-called diversification. But that was decades after he started investing. And at this point, he has a fleet of analysts, etc.

But Buffet got rich by knowing one thing - and knowing it well. - so, yes diversify. But within the exact same sector.

C3 AI is the poster child of all AI Fomo plays, and I just want you to know that the true value of the stock is more like 8 dollars. This doesn't mean that you can't make good money off of it, still, but it's Greater Fool Theory all the way.

Also, I'm not saying this as somebody that's uneducated about C3 AI. I bought C3 AI in November of 2021, primarily based on their ticker symbol. I knew that having that ticker symbol would pay off for them at a certain point. (I've been all-in on AI since 2019). I jumped out of the stock around $44.

I know that the CEO Tom Seibel is the real-deal. I still remember Seibel Systems from the late 90's. I didn't actually own shares in the late 90's, but it was a company that I followed closely and considered owning shares at different times. Oracle, funny enough, acquired all of Seibel Systems in 2005. Tom Seibel is doing the same thing that he did with Seibel Systems, only that he's added whatever the flavor of the day was to his company. C3 AI was originally named C3 Energy, and then changed to C3 IOT (internet of things). They literally started off as an energy company that was trying to help mitigate companies carbon footprints. This was back when it was all the rage, then they switched to being an Internet of Things company (again, when it was all the rage), then switched to AI.

Do you think Buffet is a passive investor?

Do you think Buffet's entire investment strategy is to buy the S&P?

And is it your contention that Berkshire Hathaway has holdings in SPY and little else? Let me help you answer that question - Here's is Berkshire's 13F SEC Filing - If you look you will see that BRK owns **SO MUCH S&P shares** that it amounts to a rounded-down **0.0%** of the portfolio:

>The vote that Paul Pelosi supposedly had inside information on was to merely provide the $52 billion to make sure the bill passed in 2021 is implemented.

You act like it's a given Congress will appropriate the funds to implement the things they authorize, or that appropriating the funds for CHIPS was trivial. 

It's not; that's why appropriations is where the real power is. Authorizers can pass bills all day (like the CHIPS Act), but if appropriators don't want to fund it, it doesn't matter - they could turn CHIPS into little more than a press release. 

Appropriators can make big or small changes to a program, they can create new programs out of whole cloth. 

Nancy is an appropriator from before she was in leadership, and knows full well how to manipulate the appropriations process - and tends to be much more involved in appropriations negotiations at a personal level than anyone of the other ""4 corners"" (House R's, Senate D's, Senate R's).  

Is it plausible that someone paying attention to DC goings on would make the play Paul did? Sure.

Because most of this is political fear mongering.

>What do you suppose will happen?

>What if no deal emerges by today?

Ok, ask this ""what if the government hits the debt ceiling?""

Hitting the debt ceiling is the same as maxing out your Credit Card or a line of credit (which is what it likely is, just a line of credit) you can't use it anymore. But that's it. You still have income from a job, you still have whatever money in your checking account, but now you can't borrow anymore.

So the government would have to instantly stop spending above revenue until the limit in the credit card gets raised. That's it.

Currently, the government spends a bit over $17 billion and makes a bit over $13 billion a day; thus borrowing about $4 billion a day. So when they hit the debt ceiling, they have to spend less for a while.",t3_13rgcp9,1685024917.0,3

More debt than assets, current factor below 1.0, year over year sales decline, negative cash flow, and increasing share count from equity based compensation.  Wayfair thinks marketing cuts and layoffs will get them to cash flow breakeven.  I think the sales decline will lead to accounts payable draining their cash.

Update: I rolled some profits into December 2025 W puts because I think 2024 will have a serious liquidity crisis as Wayfair runs out of cash.  I also opened a short and bought OTM puts on KSS.  Reporting next Wednesday, I think KSS has a big gross margin miss and guiding lower gross margins in Q1.

Truthfully I haven't isolated that indicator after the fact, on plays I have been in or plays I haven't been in, to give you an accurate answer.  My favorite indicator is the past earnings price effects, that shows a pattern of a well-run or poorly-run company when presenting to shareholders.  Neither indicator is 100%, as you can imagine, and I have had a couple surprise stinkers in there in recent weeks.

You're probably onto something and I should be tracking the accuracy of each indicator individually and then if both indicators align in the same direction how accurate they are.  I'll start doing this

drawbacks include one blanket total job total that is usually set from the previous quarter, how quick/slow a companies HR is in the hiring process (some have jobs listed from 6 months earlier, others no more than 2 months..on high conviction plays I do look into that too, one company I even broke down how much they pay compared to industry standard because it helps to show if they are struggling with people or are expanding, for the spreadsheet I just put in totals as it's tedious/time-consuming, I've also run into incorrect total employment count on various websites and its even more hit and miss for places that hire part-time etc etc)",t3_115f05b,1676861356.0,9

In finance, being short in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. There are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most fundamental method is ""physical"" selling short or short-selling, which involves borrowing assets (often securities such as shares or bonds) and selling them. \*Short positions can also be achieved through futures, forwards or options, where the investor can assume an obligation or a right to sell an asset at a future date at a price that is fixed at the time the contract is created.\*

Let's  say he shoots 50% because he's basically guessing (and he's likely not  even playing all of these, if any).  His wins cancel out his losses,  except of his 50% wins, not all of them will be profitable, because of  the nature of IV crush after earnings unless all 50% of those shoot up  huge.

So all of his losers are  losers, half of his winners are still losers.  You have a much better  chance at beating 1 or 2 option plays than a basket of 21 of them, but  by all means defend the re\*ard.

One  of his longs is Molson Coors, which reports Tuesday before open.  Do  you really think this short-sighted mo\*on has the foresight to have  already purchased options on that company prior to market close on  Friday before being spoon-fed this calendar Saturday morning.

Tesla bet, which everyone knows was the driving force behind the early surge (and caused people to mistake her for someone with a clue),  ARK took huge positions in low cap, thinly traded stocks. The very act of them acquiring shares drove the price up, especially when the crowd followed. Every position had an immediate ""positive return"", but it was all a mirage. If they ever wanted to sell shares the price would fall just as quickly, the same narrow door that drove it up would drive it down. If investors started cashing out it would accelerate the plunge as they would be forced to sell shares.

Well, that is exactly what happened. The overwhelming majority of 
ARK buyers never turned those paper gains into real gains. The over 100% annual gain was BS, it was vapor that got vaporized.

Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the tech bubble (around year 2000). At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via¬†Bloomberg):

At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

For instance APPL has much more money in the tank and is already much better in regards to consumer products I wouldn‚Äôt bet on them not just scaling it up for extra profits.

Your assumption is solely based on future growth which could end up going wrongly just because TSMC doesn‚Äôt behave the way NVDA likes to. I would rather bet on TSMC (being higher in the chain) than NVDA.

Regarding TSLA if you actually wanna go the pump & dump route (how many promises has TSLA kept from its forecasts regarding the availability and specifications of technologies? Self driving? Tesla bot? Battery exchange? Solar roofs? Tesla Semi?‚Ä¶) why don‚Äôt you invest in Memecoins? PEPE had an enormous growth!

At the end of the day BYD is much more interesting than TSLA which has to lower prices consecutively to keep up with the sales numbers. The cybertruck isn‚Äôt even out and Ford has already the F150 giving it hard competition. In the sports car range Porsche Taycan Turbo S has beaten the model S performance not only regarding performance but also built quality, safety features & quick charging. In the mid range tier KIA EV9 seems also to be a better pickup. Low-end tier (which TSLA doesn‚Äôt even offer although it was promised for years to have stuff below 20K) BYD is dominating the whole market and has surpassed VW in sales.
Not to mention that APPL is working on a high-end fully self-driving car that can be called on-demand using a subscription system ‚Äî GOOGL is also heading into the market.
So good luck regarding the future performance of your TSLA stock!

The way I understand it, a strangle would involve buying or selling out of the money options around a specific strike in hopes that the price moves significantly in either direction. (I just set one up with SQQQ and TQQQ in hopes of move related to the debt ceiling.

I bought NVDA calls that had quite a bit of time value before earnings. With the jump in price, they are deep in the money, but have lost most their time value. This gave me a few options: sell my calls right away for basically their intrinsic value or wait to sell my calls for basically their intrinsic value at a letter date. The later option gives me the benefit of exposure to NVDA for that time, but of course it has the down side potential, so I bought some puts.  The goal is less that I want to see a significant swing in either direction and more so that I want to see a swing in the positive direction and insurance from a swing in the negative direction. If the price goes down I won't loose anything but the put's time value, and I won't make anything either. If the price goes up, I can make more than the put costs.",t3_13t7o8o,1685218457.0,3

13617,jlwpkjg,t1_jlw2859,"The problem is that very few people on this sub have any idea what ""sell the news"" means.

Most people think it means ""the stock/market will sell when there is news.""

It doesn't mean ""the equity always sells once news is realized."" It's a euphemism that comes from a perspective of going long on **speculation**.

When there's coming news that people are speculating on, it's common to overshoot on the directionality of the speculation via linear bias. I.e. Apple has an iphone release and we're waiting on numbers to come out, and people speculate that sales are like +100 million but they really end up +80 million.

That's a ""sell the news"" event because the reality winds up having a lower target than the speculative information. It can also happen if the forward expectation of an event evaporates once it hits.

What happens if AAPL get 120 million sales? Does the stock sell off?

No, in that case the stock melts up because the valuation is higher than the fundamentals position.

NVDA had a case like this last week. Lots of bears thought NVDA earnings was a sell the news event because of high speculative value being higher than they thought AI-oriented hardware sales were... and it went the other direction and those bears learned a very real, serious lesson about how sayings aren't always literal.

I don't have a crystal ball or anything, but the speculation around the debt ceiling was anxiety speculation, which restrains long positioning across the market. Right now, you can see that in the breadth of the market, which many people on this sub take to mean that tech stocks are getting overextended, but the reality is that breadth dynamics of great divide are actually more likely historically to push the market up (or at least the chances are indeterminant in the condition) since bullish patterns often have sector leaders that then turn into breadth thrusts, where the breadth of the rest of the market catches up.

In other words, if you ignore the runner, the rest of the market is broadly positioned in a fear state. In part due to the debt ceiling, but also due to expectations on earnings and those are going up. Now the debt ceiling is part of the bear case for this year, and institutions are restraining buys because of default risk.

So which direction is reversal on this news? Which direction is the ""sell""? As an anxiety event, the direction on realization without the world falling apart is typically up.

Stop and think about it. Your ""sell the news"" argument is basically that the market is positioning betting FOR a default and this would surprise the direction of capital to the down side without it happening.

That's not what the market's doing. Aside from the AI bubble, the market's in fear mode... you're just not seeing it in the index value directionality because of the bubble.

And that bubble will eventually burst, but there has to actually be a downside surprise first.",t3_13tnigz,1685249085.0,42

Imagine a company is rumored to get a contract from the government but nobody knows until next month. People will speculate what amount, when, if, how and all else. This creates a range for the stock and if good news are expected a skew to the positive side. Let's say the actual outcome is that the particular company is going up +10% in profits but the range before you know for sure is between +30% and +0% that means the uncertainty of something has value even if the likely outcome is +10% because it could be better. The average of the rumor in this case would be 15% which is higher than the 10% so the stock would be higher as it prices in the 15%. That's why lot's of rumored good news lead to stock drops once something becomes certain. The same works btw with negative news. If negative news are expected a stock usually goes up once the negative news become certain as many had some expectation of a possible worse outcome.

>In other words, if you ignore the runner, the rest of the market is broadly positioned in a fear state. In part due to the debt ceiling, but also due to expectations on earnings and those are going up. Now the debt ceiling is part of the bear case for this year, and institutions are restraining buys because of default risk.

Exactly why I expect the indices to go down though

Last week‚Äôs AI earnings made people forget, but mega caps were getting bid as ‚Äòsafety rotation‚Äô for months and months. They were just the default stocks to park money in because of the debt ceiling shenanigans.

I expect there to be sizeable outflows from these guys and inflows into other parts of the market. Not only just the inflows into others. You are totally right, this will help fix breadth. But the problem is that these major tech stocks make up so much of the major indices that SPX and NDX should be red red

And on top of that the mega caps are overbought and ripe for some profit taking

The point I'm getting at in the quoted text is that your scenario is one possibility, but we also see this kind of breadth structure in markets that are recovering, too.

Part of the problem with the sub is that we're kind of trained to react to pump n dumps, so we automatically assume that every pump leads to an immediate dump because most of the plays this sub does are not based on a forward expectation via mass accumulation of institutions. Those are momentum plays, and they can insane and run for a long time, which will be easier with funds released at institutions after the threat of a default is over (It resets the potential risk-free rate of return lower). 

The AI play is institutions. I think it's a bubble, but I don't know where we are in that bubble.

What I can say definitively is that the overextension in much of tech right now is based in expectations of CapEx investment over the next 6-12 months. It's gonna take that playing out for there to be a significant deleverage like bears want in that space. It's not just a defensive story, and that's apparent in NVDA's earnings announcement, it's about forward CapEx and sales expectations.

So these aren't speculative overdrive yet driven by ramps and squeezes, they're forward-looking positions. To get the move we got in NVDA this week, you have to have institutions building position.

Now there's some rationality in the nearterm to your position, where the auction cycle will eventually slow and pressure will come off the float and price will come down then... but we just don't know where we are in that process.

I didn't say it wasn't a squeeze. It's absolutely a squeeze. There is 100% a technical component to this.

But a squeeze is not the same thing as a pump and dump. 

A pump and dump is a squeeze where institutions don't take long positions, so the valuation collapses. When a meme stock runs when it's highly shorted and about to go bankrupt, that's a pump and dump. People evaporate positions during the run and they aren't real, so the valuation deflates as the float relieves all pressure. 

When a stock squeezes because people keep buying options and institutions are buying (they buy options for their positions, too), then that's a momentum run. In momentum runs, float pressure remains high, resulting in higher and longer runs that often don't deflate entirely at all.

I absolutely did not say this wasn't a squeeze. :) It's just not a pump and dump.

&#x200B;

> But volatility has been seeing much more call liquidity, especially after a note from JPM came out (I think it was them) telling their clients to snatch up VIX calls. There are signs that this bullish positioning is starting to abate 

Institutions always do this during accumulation runs. VIX calls are a common hedge. They do not necessarily imply a change of direction.

They can also go up for short periods of time with the market, which is one of the reasons institutions like them as hedges. People get surprised by this every few weeks on the daily thread. We don't see the correlation with upswings on the longterm graphs that people use because they get flattened out with the longer timeframe as the longer uptrends reduce the VIX further, but going from flat ranging to a big move up also (for a short period of time) drives volatility up, too.

VIX calls are what you use when you don't know but just expect a big move. If you think there's a change in direction, you direct a sell on the market or a tighter hedge. Basically VIX hedges allow you to keep the long net position.

Not to mention VIX hedges are warranted at the technical SPY 420 level anyway just because of the risk of resistance... purely as risk management, because it's either going to reject and drop or break and run at some point in the nearterm.

>There is some mix of concrete institutional buying with positioning chasing. I lean more towards positional chasing.

So how much of MSFT‚Äôs run is AI hype versus safety buying and positioning? Who knows. But some chunk of it is that will get cashed out 

Sure, but my point is that at this point we don't know what is what, how much, or when.

Part of the reason all of this is running is because this quarter's earnings are seriously overperforming against current position expectations. 

Like significantly. To the extent that earnings expectations and S&P 500 top level expectations are going up. Firms that were pricing in 200 earnings are adjusting to 215... not on forward expectations, recession's still the base case in many cases there, or at least a pullback of some type, but on the simple fact that the earnings being higher now means earnings projections for the year have already outperformed, which changes the balance sheet expectations.

You have to think about this like an institution with a balance sheet: they're positioning for adjustment relative to forward earnings, which are now officially significantly higher across the S&P than bearish projections... actually closer to more bullish projections. That's in the bag, not speculative.

That means idle capital has to go to risk assets to compensate and not be left behind... that's why we're seeing position-building.

&#x200B;

>I lean towards the mean reversion happening sooner than later. The recent rallying has ignored rates going up 

So this is not exactly what's happening. It's not that they've ignored rates, it's that the relationship between rates and stocks have changed because the flow relationship has changed. 

Stocks don't always correlate opposite rates. In fact, they quite often run with rates, but which correlation you have depends on the part of the market cycle you're in and how flows are going.

In the very short term, yields may be rising, but they're on the longer term compared to the end of last year on a bull steepening run. Post-SVB, yields dropped out more and values raised, this increases values on bonds against par with already locked-in higher yields. While yields going up slightly may be higher than the recent low, it's still in a downtrend even with the debt ceiling shrinking.

And institutions aren't stupid, they know a default would skyrocket rates, and that higher ""risk-free"" (wouldn't exactly be risk-free anymore, but would still be a safer bet than most equal yield bonds) rate represents both a balance sheet  risk and an opportunity.

Basically, the current bull steepening happening, and inflection in the yield curves to steepening, results in positive correlation between yield movement and stock market movement because of accumulation of flows from bond holdings into risk equities. That's driving yields up because of lower bond demand buys (due to lower rates several months ago and the expectation of future higher rates). And you better believe they were holding excess capital because of the balance sheet default risk and risk of yields going up imbalancing offset holdings. 

And if there's no default, then that threat's off the table. Think like an institution, not a retail trader putting everything on black. Institutions have balance sheets and risk departments. (I used to be an officer in one... now I just write and maintaining the modeling software they use... fewer long nights, less overall stress, more money LOL)

So the bond market/stock market correlation behavior has changed, and it doesn't have to go back just because we're used to it being inverted.

This is also why the 60/40 portfolio is working again. In fact, that's your sign that this is more the recent normal behavior... it's making the common retirement plan standard distribution behave normally.

Now the last risk is a recession and/or bank failure at the end of the year.

13752,jlx4z8h,t1_jlx0zn5,">it‚Äôs ignored the dollar going up

That's kind of a bigger risk, so I'll give you that one.

&#x200B;

>it‚Äôs ignored fed fund futures pricing in more hawkishness

It's not ignoring, it's that the Fed raising another 25 or 50 bps is an expected risk and unless it causes a bank collapse or recession, it's a smaller risk compared to a default.

It's just that this is less than the current anxiety threat.

>GS is estimating over half a trillion of treasuries being issued very quickly over the next 2 months.

Is it, though?

[https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/)

The treasury already issued $1-2T every month this year, and even if that $.5T is on top of the normal, spread over 4 release periods (treasury issues bonds twice a month) we're talking with in the normal range of fluctuation. And a lot of bonds are maturing, so there's also hundreds of billions rotating in this period.

It's not crazy to think that excess bonds will drive up yields a bit and put flow pressure on things, but it's also mostly fear based on the Fear of Large Numbers. They do need to rehydrate the general fund, but I don't think people understand how much money moves through the bond market on any given month, because it's A LOT more than half a trillion.

&#x200B;

>My guess for the near term is a gap and crap to put it mildly. Brief euphoria to start the week.

The week itself is a wildcard for me. It's anyone's guess within a couple percent barring any other news, but I just don't think ""heavy capital pressure on fear"" is really matching the actual capital dynamics of non-default here.

I'm more thinking the next few months. I think there's still risk, but some of the assumptions people are making are based on continuation of fear and expectation of market crash, rather than a view of the balance sheet.

Basically they're offering stock stock and more stock and I honestly don't know what the effective difference is for warrant vs stock vs purchase contract or how a debt security really works but here are the definitions sourced from investopedia.

Warrants: Warrants are a derivative that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security‚Äîmost commonly an equity‚Äîat a certain price before expiration. The price at which the underlying security can be bought or sold is referred to as the exercise price or strike price. An American warrant can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date, while European warrants can only be exercised on the expiration date. Warrants that give the right to buy a security are known as call warrants; those that give the right to sell a security are known as put warrants.  

Debt Security: A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date.

Purchase Contract: A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction to occur between a buyer and seller. SPAs are typically used for real estate transactions, but they are found in other areas of business. The agreement finalizes the terms and conditions of the sale, and it is the culmination of negotiations between the buyer and the seller.",t3_11eo3ge,1677636698.0,40

I like the work you put in for your post. And while your statement isn't false, I also wouldn't agree that it's a fair assessment of VOO/SPY.

There is less diversification and overweight in tech RIGHT NOW. But the S&P500 top performers have changed throughout the years.

The point of indexes etfs and their fees is that they will automatically rotate and rebalance. Most businesses aren't successful. Even successful businesses don't always stocks that go up. Even those don't always have high ROI. Even if a business outperforms and returns higher ROI, it might only do so in a sector where it's peers are doing poorly.

***The overweight on the top performers in the SPY/VOO isn't a bug. It's the fucking feature.*** Some might need to realize this if they don't, but investors that actually real the prospectus before investing would know and buy because of it. It's overweight on tech right now because the market has deemed those as the best stocks. I know it's common on WSB to believe we're a bunch of special snowflakes that can outsmart the market but anyone with 101IQ would realize that the market is often much smarter than the average guy. Each of those companies have strong moats, high growth, strong balance sheets, strong revenue streams, high profits, return value to shareholders, etcetcetc

Ask yourself do you really want a higher % weight of SVB, SBNY, FRC, DISH, FOX, or NWS? No because they fucking suck. Look at the loss porn.  Even their smaller weights are too much because people who bought VOO/SPY had their SVB and SBNY basically go to 0. They should be fucking mad those were in there at all and glad they were saved by being overweight into MSFT & GOOG instead of those shits.

You wouldn't even want JPM, BAC, WFC, or C over the tech stocks. They are the ones getting BTFO and going back to pandemic lows. They are suffering low growth, locked into low rate bonds, have billions in unrealized losses, have the risk of bank runs or credit contagion, and are begging the government for bailouts . Fucking Apple? Has over $150B IN CASH RESERVES. You know how much fucking money that is? That was the money THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAD TO PUT OUT TO BAIL OUT SVG AND SBNY. APPLE COULD HAVE BAILED THOSE FUCKS OUT BY ITSELF. THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS BUYING APPLE AND PUSHING IT'S CAP UP. And Apple doesn't have that debt. Instead it has a strong revenue source. 

Not really my job to tell you all what to do or think, but the great thing is that we can all make our own investments. Anyone who doesn't like the weighted S&P can go buy the equal weighted S&P or YOLO into 0DTE FRC.",t3_120lcdp,1679676011.0,184

The most interesting scenario I could come up with from this situation is the following:

1. Warren Buffett takes Berkshire's entire cash position ($100B) and shorts QQQ. That alone would tank the market if it got out, but it's not good enough for a true doomsday scenario.
2. He sells his entire stake in AAPL, which causes the shift to begin.
3. Simultaneously, he releases the dirt he has gleaned from his best friend Bill Gates, both from Bill's private life and the horrible state of affairs only they know about at Microsoft.
4. Hilarity ensues!

14015,jdjx5z3,t3_120lcdp,"This concentration also hides the damage that has been dealt to the rest of the market. Part of the reason people don't think this bear market has bottomed is because the S&P 500 didn't get that 40% or 50% drawdown, but current small cap valuations are basically around where they bottomed during the GFC. But the S&P 500 is more concentrated than it ever has been and you won't get that 40% to 50% drawdown without AAPL and MSFT getting cut in half. Do you think they will get cut in half? Probably not.

""Every now and then, a macro event drives stocks into mars, with an army of valuation decriers.

Generative dotcom technology is fundamentally rewriting our economy.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to make your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run someone else's dotcom model.

Literally any time you see a company mention generative dotcom technology, which is gonna be every single company, they're basically announcing to the world they are giving the overvalued dotcom stock money.

There is not a single overvalued dotcom stock chip available right now. They are all accounted for the next two years.

This is based on current perception.

There's something very important in dotcom technology that you need to remember, and that is how when models get larger, they have demonstrated learning abilities that the developers did not specifically teach.

The potential for winner take all outcome is ENORMOUS with dotcom technology. FANG is fighting for their lives right now. It is not just Google.

If you are concerned about a ban on dotcom technology, know that it contributes only 20% of revenue for the overvalued dotcom stock, and there is no way it won't try to smuggle this overhyped tech at higher prices. /s Those future chips are already sold.

If you are concerned about insider sales, remember that Moderna insiders also sold all the way up, many too early.

Just like Moderna, the overvalued dotcom stock boldly gambled on an unproven technology, and the world is primed.

But the overvalued dotcom stock is not Moderna. There is no demand cliff coming.

Human species have begun building the ultimate human unchained by mortal meat, a god.

Its organs are the overvalued dotcom stock cards. TAM of divinity is infinity.

The overvalued dotcom stock is not 4090. The overvalued dotcom stock is gh200.

Stop listening to doomers on debt or recession. There is once in human history story playing out right now.""",t3_14lcu3s,1687988377.0,2

Mining was only significant for AMD GPUs during the Vega era. Thanks miners, that was 4-5 years ago now though. The GPU market is not the same as it was then. If you'd been paying attention, AMD has sold every piece of hardware they've been able to manufacture. Having the 2nd best GPUs didn't matter at all to their bottom line, why do you think Intel was trying to get into that market too?

Console revenue is insignificant due to low margins, though it's good marketing for the brand. With both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox using AMD hardware, there was likely a very good reason for both to ditch ""team green"". Not to mention the recent news with EVGA, I'd think Nvidia has more troubled relationships with 3rd parties than AMD ever has.

Server CPUs are AMD's bread and butter currently, and they have no competition from Intel on that front. This is projected to be a big year in terms of server market share gains (directly taken from Intel), and even with a falling consumer CPU/GPU market, AMD hasn't signaled that growth will be slowing at all. What does that tell you?

And yeah, AMD paid for my bedroom furniture in 2018 and anyone who sold early this year/late last year made out like bandits. They've been effective at paying down debts and using their revenue to acquire more companies and expand their market in recent years. Xilinx has a big chunk of revenue and used to pay a dividend, which many expect to continue in the coming years.

AMD generates money hand over fist, and there have been plenty of opportunities to get out with a significant profit, if one chooses to do so.",t3_xj0bft,1663688556.0,2

GPU demand is expected to drop, but that's a solid reason why the company that manufactures both GPUs *and* CPUs is the safer choice. Intel tried to get into GPUs for a similar reason, it really broadens their market.",t3_xj0bft,1663688860.0,3
14453,ip9l1ig,t1_ip8dfcp,"They made massive gains over Intel in the last few years. Ryzen has forced them to push their chips to the limits, which is why they've had poor thermals over the last few years. Intel stagnated for the better part of a decade with no real competition and AMD came and kicked their asses into gear with Zen 2 and Zen 3.

Now we're seeing actusl progress instead of 14nm+++++++ architectures with minimal performance uplift.

Edit:

As for GPUs, AMD has become competitive again. The 6900XT and 3090 traded blows pretty readily. They may not be market leaders, but they've been nipping at the heels of Intel and Nvidia recently, which has been incredible for consumers. Nvidia does have a huge edge over AMD in the productivity field with their NVENC accelerated rendering being used with all mainstream software, but AMD has a similar edge over Intel on most professional workloads.

AMD expects server demand to continue. Consumer GPUs are a quarter of their revenue at best. They'd need to lose out on a LOT of GPU sales for it to make an impact. And this next gen of GPUs is bringing generational gains in performance (claim made both by AMD and Nvidia). Thinking they won't have demand for a few quarters is unrealistic.

1. Nvidia is just an enterprise hardware vendor, which means it's easily replaceable, so large data centers will negotiate huge discounts and their margins will drop significantly.
2. A.I. isn't a new thing and competition has been around for quite some time: Google Cloud TPUs, AWS Annapurna chips, MS Athena (MS mostly owns OpenAI - a company behind ChatGPT), Apple M2 Silicon for Apple products, Tesla low energy FSD chip manufactured since 2019 and now DOJO for data centers. Why overpay if you can keep it in-house and make it better suited to your needs (Apple, Tesla)?
3. Nvidia alone doesn't deliver customer products (iPhone, Mac, Xbox, Tesla cars) or data center services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), so currently they ""can't skip the middleman"" - it's only possible for them to sell the product directly in gaming PCs or smaller data centers or A.I. labs.
4. TMSC can screw them hard on margins for high capacity reservations and Nvidia is currently 100% reliant on them. Supposedly they're in talks with Intel about the fabs.

Cisco is currently doing $14B quarterly sales and $3B profit, but after 23 years of being good enterprise hardware company, they've only climbed back to 40% of 2000s hype market cap, and they currently stand barely above $200B. Compare that to current $7B sales, $2B profit and forward $11B quarter in sales. I wouldn't be surprised if similar scenario played out here, because similar misjudgment is at play - Most successful internet companies (Google, Facebook, MS, etc) that succeeded don't care to pay dues to Cisco or telcos like AT&T, because they don't have to. Same thing will happen to A.I. companies - they'll undermine existing order. Current A.I. hype and propping up Nvidia is like pumping telcos or Cisco during dotcom bubble, while Googles and Amazons weren't invented yet or are still being built in someones garage.",t3_13w173u,1685553593.0,14

There are a lot of different segments in the lidar market. My post is really targeting consumer automobiles (not robo-taxis or anything thing else). For my post, the customer is primarily automobile OEMs who sell to consumers and not the companies you mentioned. 

Consumer automobile lidar will be the largest chuck of the lidar sector. That's where the big orders with a lot of volume will happen. In my opinion, MVIS is the only lidar that meets all the OEM RFQ requirements for enabling level 3 ADAS and above. 

Level 5 ADAS (full autonomous cars) are still quite a few years away. We've been through the trough of the disillusionment phase. As of this moment, its kinda a pipeline dream.",t3_13l3z7b,1684710815.0,3

14827,jo2ce0r,t3_148tol9,"The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.

Look at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.

Intel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.

All the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.

This isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. 

For all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.

I'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). 

Spurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. 

Somebody must've had a good fortune cookie.

It's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.

But nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.

Because anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.

But do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?

Honestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.

I don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.

Will the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation.

If you are serious about your gambling, go watch Computex 2023 Keynote speech by Jensen. It's 2 hrs. Brutal. But little fluff.

Spoiler: Anyone with a decent sized closet can buy a 1 exaflop system. What's that mean?

Every time you say, ""One-One Thousand"" their DGX GH200 system can perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 floating point operations (maths). Every second. This is utterly ridiculous.

Just as a **fun** comparison:

7 years ago, China built the Sunway Taihulight. Everyone had a super boner because it was the fastest supercomputer on earth. And of course, all the know nothing imbeciles started proclaiming the end of the Republic (probably bears) -  [China's New Supercomputer Puts the US Even Further Behind | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/fastest-supercomputer-sunway-taihulight/)

Cost: Approx **$300,000,000** \- It has 10,649,600 processors, 1 Petabyte of memory, and requires a massive **warehouse, and incredible amounts of electricity,** and like all other supercomputers, is built in stages and often takes years to complete.

NVDA DGX - **256** interconnected GPUs, 144 Terabytes of memory. Fits in a large closet. Is delivered complete in a few weeks.

Sunway Taihulight - 100 petaflops

NVDA DGX - 1 exaflop (10 times faster)

So NVDA went ahead and built a computing device that is, pound-for-pound, faster than anything else on earth, smaller, and requires less power. Literally the holy grail of what everyone is trying to achieve.",t3_148tol9,1686721616.0,0

They don't even own the factories - they rely on TSMC like everyone else, so they're bidding with Cloud Providers and that will eat their margins.

Important product/company does not equate to being properly valued. There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.

Even if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are ""technically"" the same idea.

The only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations.

What? AMD was making athlon in 1999. The bigger issue with Intel was they relied on business sales to companies like pets.com. Intel's revenue in 2000 was $33b and it's revenue just before the housing crash was $38b.

>I'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). 

???????? Nvidia has been investing into CUDA since 2007! Using GPUs for compute is something they saw coming almost two decades ago and has been investing into during all that time.

>Because anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.

That doesn't mean Nvidia is better and it's ok to overpay 40% for 10-20% performance - they're just throwing more money at more expensive technology they don't own (TSMC, ASML do).

Last time I've checked Nvidia had no cloud offering, except for failing GeForce Now and some investment in CoreWeave startup, and no serious A.I. team that delivers production-grade services like ChatGPT, Self-Driving, etc. For some reason they stick to demos and hardware.

It might be tough catching up with the [rest of infrastructure and 150+ other products](https://cloud.google.com/) if they're serious about competing with current Cloud providers.

Im not saying they're worthless, but they won't have any ability to protect $1T valuation with their chips and CUDA alone.

Microsoft, Google and Apple have lots of tricks in their sleeves to protect their big businesses. This includes protecting from stupidly leaking huge money elsewhere.

Tensorflow and pytorch are not ""high level abstractions"". The fuck are you on about? They're ML  libraries that both use CUDA/RocM.

Hahahahahah this is some premium Elon fanboying.

*Checks profile* just as I thought. An alt with like 10 comments total who does nothing but fanboy Tesla.

When Tesla finishes their chip it'll be on the level of Intel arcs *at best*, and it will have absolutely zero support or software or any devs who work with it beyond those who developed it at Tesla.

Tensorflow/pytorch are not universal plug and play, they have to implement support for whatever shitty library Tesla comes up with. It took pytorch till June 2022 to support ROCM/AMD, the idea that you can just plug a brand new Tesla chip in is nonsense.

You linked a Google article about their own TPU they spent years developing as leaders in AI. They also literally created tensorflow to work with their own TPU. And despite tensorflow being the most popular library, nobody outside of Google uses their TPU.

The idea that a fucking car company can just swoop in and create a competitive TPU with absolutely no industry or academic support and take marketshare is just hilarious when even Google can't get into the market and they literally developed the tools devs use.

Lol the spike in sales is to startups and businesses developing their own models. These companies are not going to pay the massive premium for an AWS Bedrock or Google cloud. 

10-20% performance? Using your own Google link, they're literally 9 times slower than the latest H100 chip from Nvidia. Congrats Google managed to beat the 3 years old A100(and not for cost) finally.

If TPUs were competitive, Google - the leader, would be selling them. They're not because they know nobody will buy something that costs more and is several years behind the market leader.

You haven't checked very hard. 

https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-generative-ai-to-worlds-enterprises-with-cloud-services-for-creating-large-language-and-visual-models

Moreover, Nvidia has never really been interested in competing with its database partners. MS/OpenAI uses Nvidia chips, and Oracle which has a quarter of the database marketshare plans on using Nvidia in its cloud offering as well.

More importantly, the TPU based cloud offerings are in their infancy *at best*. For the next several years ML will remain dominated by Nvidia, with Google doing their own thing separate from the rest of the industry like they have been doing for years.

Consoles run AMD(except switch) because Nvidia had zero interest in the ultra low margin console market. PCs are not getting rid of discrete GPUs anytime soon despite Intel and AMD's best efforts.

$7B in revenue, $4.65B gross profit, just under $3B excluding R&D which would be that ""converting to earnings"" your talking about. So $12B a year at this rate, which would only take just over 84 years for you to make its market cap in earnings. Let's assume they tripppe their earnings in the next 10 years, and this is assuming no R&D spend mind you... you're still looking at 28 years to make back your full investment in earnings. Equity isn't much help because that's only currently $24.5 billion, with $6 billion of thay being net intangible assets. And this is all assuming they remain market dominate for this long...

Lol.

Lol, TensorFlow has been developed by Google, not Nvidia, and they abstract-out everything.

Not saying they don't sell their hardware, I'm saying they need their ""partners"" to buy their stuff more than their partners need them to sell it to them (competition!) and in the long run, they'll be forced to lower their margins. Adobe doesn't have a viable competition, but Nvidia does or very soon will have, so Adobe will always be in stronger position at the negotiating table.

> 10-20% performance? Using your own Google link, they're literally 9 times slower than the latest H100 chip from Nvidia. Congrats Google managed to beat the 3 years old A100(and not for cost) finally.

2 year old 7nm Cloud TPU is faster than 3 year old 7nm A100 GPU. From Nvidia's own data sheets it seems that 4nm H100 is usually 3-4 times faster than A100: [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-h100-hopper-benchmark-results-published](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-h100-hopper-benchmark-results-published) . Also, H100 has increased power consumption up to 700W, while A100 used up to 450W. Same trick they did with 4090s melting power supplies. If you consider capex (twice as expensive) and opex costs (Wh/tflop), it doesn't seem like a revolution - just a next iteration of technology. This doesn't turn a $100B company into $1T company overnight. Next year you'll see similar TPUs.

> If TPUs were competitive, Google - the leader, would be selling them. They're not because they know nobody will buy something that costs more and is several years behind the market leader.

Google is in the Cloud business, so they're not selling it due to their business model. Nothing stops them from revising this policy or at least leasing their TPUs on-prem, like [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/rack/).

> Consoles run AMD(except switch) because Nvidia had zero interest in the ultra low margin console market. PCs are not getting rid of discrete GPUs anytime soon despite Intel and AMD's best efforts.

Market doesn't care what Nvidia has interest in, but whether they can sell it and maintain their margin. They've got kicked out from gaming and they will be kicked out from A.I. compute the same way unless they decrease their margins like AMD did.

All the things you've said were just as applicable to Cisco in 2000. Better hardware specification (throughput -> tflops), hyped up internet companies ""needed"" their equipment to serve customers, easier to use software, more options, IT people loved it and it was more prestigious than some cheap Juniper. It didn't matter, because the market demand saturated, competition caught up, companies became less dependent on them for their business and they've had to give up their margins. It's not a question about quality, but business reality.

> Oh and says the Tesla fanboy alt shilling Tesla at ATH whilst simultaneous claiming Nvidia with faster growth is somehow worth less. If you had any balls you'd post with your main.

It's not my alt and I wasn't shilling it at ATH. I'm not a regular user, but when I decided to short this shit, I couldn't look at all the moronic content people produce. Dumb people here are too influential to be ignored.

For now, it seems they've printed themselves enough money with stock issuance ($10B), which they invest in A.I. startups that will be obligated to buy their hardware, so for few next quarters they should be fine with their sales projection, so they'll be using your money to create short-term demand for their own hardware.",t3_148tol9,1686762213.0,0

Institutional players know that all the average joes are looking at the same thing, waiting to short at the obvious peak, or resistance level, from last year.

This will put all those average joes underwater and trigger their (short) stop losses. This leads to a large short covering under which the stock price skyrockets (a squeeze). While the stupid shorts are all covering, the institutional players will be selling to them at stupidly high prices. Note that all this action takes place intraday, the average joes I'm referring to are all those retail day traders who are all eagerly awaiting for the stock price to hit 289 (thinking no one else is seeing that) in order to quickly enter their shorts.

If you take just FIVE S&P 500 stocks and put them into an index, they are up 86% this year.

These stocks are $META, **$NVDA**, $MSFT, $AAPL and $TSLA.

Meanwhile, the entire S&P 500 is currently up roughly 12% this year. 

When you take these five stocks out of the S&P 500, forming the S&P 495, the index is up just 3% this year. *Concerning*

 If you remove all AI-based stocks from the S&P 500, the index is flat this year.

These facts were from early June when I last checked in, and they may be *slightly* different, but the idea stands that tech is holding the S&P up. So I wouldn't personally bet against the tech industry rn.. Basically betting against a major market mover.

Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. 

Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; 

https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/

A discounted future cash flow model HAS to be compared to the current market price for it to have any relevance.

You would have to ask some specific questions and hope that the seller was being honest. Even myself being more familiar with GPU mining than the average person (I hope) couldn‚Äôt spot a mining card without at least some research.

I feel like just the volume on the market will drag the price down. Plus at less than $200, if it blows up you can just get another one.

There really is no way to know, that is basically the problem. You can't look at a GPU and know it's history, nor is there an odometer of use or indicator that shows previous temps or utilization. 

Any used high end card on ebay has a chance of being used for mining previously.

I thought I had a ""geforce 1"" for a time...wiki says that is most likely a geforce 2.

I never did get rich about tech history. I just lived it. Ge Force was not doing well..fun while they lasted, seemed gimmicky. 

I sent stuff back more than several times, warranty. . I assumed they would die off...

on a more humble note, I have always wondered how minds can think alike to make amazing things. As if asian was the other side of the world in every way.

my dna test has unassigned data, and zero asian.

iPhone 1 release date = June 2007.

Apple market cap = $106bn

Largest company @ mid 2007 = Exxon Mobil @ 472bn when oil was >$100 and spiking up

Microsoft was the largest tech company @ 281bn market cap.

The only 'tech' companies larger than AAPL was CSCO, INTC and IBM all trading in 100-200bn range.

So if you adjust the timescale, NVDA is in the same spot AAPL was when they released the iPhone 1.

In 2007, it was MSFT, IBM, CSCO, INTC then AAPL.

In 2023, it is AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN then NVDA.

MSFT - the largest company back then was 2.8 times larger than AAPL back then.

AAPL today is 2.8 times larger than NVDA now.

In 1983, the largest company was worth ~30bn.

In 2003, the largest company was worth ~300bn.

In 2023, the largest company is worth 2750bn.

In 2043, the largest company following the above trend, could be above 25000bn or 25tn. Inflation and growth will push many companies past 1tn in the 2030s for sure",t3_13urdeh,1685376971.0,39

16647,jnnbp86,t3_145r5yd,"People don‚Äôt understand how incredibly expensive 30x sales is. If the company had no costs, paid no salaries, issued no stock comp, and returned all of its revenues to shareholders, it would take 30 years to pay you back‚Ä¶ you can assume growth of course but that‚Äôs A LOT of ground to make up.

In comparison, the 30 year is paying you 4% per year.

Take a look at the long time chart of CSCO.

Cisco has a negative annualized return going back to April of 2000. 23 years and the return is still NEGATIVE. This is with dividends reinvested.

It‚Äôs far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.

No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.

I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.

And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.

I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift.

The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.

Assume AI has the real potential to add revenue or reduce costs or both for companies.  You honestly think companies won't throw money at the market leader with no real competitor when a $1 in spend may result in $5 out and differentiate them from competitors and help them gain/win market share? NVDA is selling the infrastructure for AI to other companies.

This is nothing like the dot com bubble where companies seldom had real products and were not making substantial revenue, let alone profit like NVDA.  Go back and do some reading on the dot companies bubble.  Now, do some research on AI specifically on NVDA to see how far ahead they are.  They literally have a SaaS offering for AI that companies can SUBSCRIBE to without a large capital outlay, so the barrier to entry for THEIR customer is almost non-existent.

Moores law started to die because the ability to shrink dies stopped being feasible - Too many reasons to get into here.

But essentially, it comes down to **Heat** (energy consumption and dissipation), and **space** (even between the transistors themselves) - This has been the constant limiting factor in technological advancement.

The irony is a wish I had been a degenerate fuck like you when I bought a lotto ticket pre-earnings.  I‚Äôd be rich as fuck, might have hit a 9 digit portfolio  full yolo on margin.  

I‚Äôd take some of that money and place a job ad

Hiring 30 highly motivated individuals 

Job benefits 

Work 1 day a month

Any car on the market of your choosing which you keep on expiration of your employment contract.  
Full health care, dental vision, 10K monthly contributions to retirement accounts.  Potential for travel.

Job details

10 year contract 

1 day out of the month you must without fail religiously follow a broke degenerate around while throwing $1 bills on the ground once every min while low key singing 

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
 
Must deliver a small Wendy‚Äôs value meal with most of the fries missing on a solid gold tray. 

Occasionally may need to complete short demonstration such as placing $100 bills in easter eggs filled with Opossum shit.  Then you will need to randomly drop these eggs in front of them while reminding them some asshole degenerate on Reddit got lucky on a massive YOLO that printed years ago and decided to troll you for 10 years.

ADDITIONAL KEY INFORMATION 

At first the degenerate will resist picking up the dollars at some point will start to pick up a couple here and there and say ‚Äúthanks for coffee!‚Äù  or some other nonsense they are somehow winning in this scenario.  

From there the day will come when the degenerate will start to picking all of them up while keeping tally of his total.  It might happen on your shift or the next persons shift but at some point they will yell out ‚ÄúAw Ha, this is enough for me to get back in the game.  I can buy 4 1 Delta 0DTE calls and that will make me enough to start rebuilding‚Äù. You‚Äôll need to follow them to somewhere with free wifi, but you can go ahead and give them a hotspot if you‚Äôd like.  

At this stage they will be essentially addicted to the dollar bills you drop.  Pacing around waiting for the next $1 and scramming about to grab them.  Might run off to deposit them, but will be back quickly after depositing and transferring a few bucks to their Robinhood account.  You will now go from following to leading as the degenerate will follow you about to collect the dollar bills.  You‚Äôll be leading the degenerate to some random places, visiting Wendy‚Äôs often and in the later years might need to coordinate having this degenerate follow the dollar bills to wall street and walk him around any lobby you get access to.  After this trip you‚Äôll be dropping quarters.  The degenerate may resist again at first but ultimately will get right back to following you.

Near the end of your contract you‚Äôll need to lead the degenerate to wherever i maybe as a little blast from the pass surprise for me.  You‚Äôll parade the quarter addicted degenerate around whatever area I‚Äôm in until I notice and say something like WTF? But I‚Äôll eventually remember what‚Äôs going on and start laughing my ass off.  This will conclude your contract.",t3_13u2eot,1685315120.0,0

Seems like we got a recession like 2001-2003. Mostly Tech, Crypto and tech related slow down for a reset. 
I think broader market is doing well and adjusting so I am not 100% sure if inflation will come down frankly to 3-4 by 2023 EOY leading to broader recession. 

I see house prices in west coast come down that camel hump(2020-2022 mid). So 25-35% down. All high salaries could shrink and normalize but essential workers could see bump. Leading to overall wage growth and job growth good given ‚ÄúEconomy doing great‚Äù talk from Fed, which will be understood by Analysts as Dovish but what they in-fact saying is Hawkish. Higher for longer. I can lift 100 pounds but cant hold 100 for 5+ mins - Pain; my analogy.

17289,j7ycd04,t3_10yansu,"Tesla can really be a wild card but it appears to just aim straight for the top of the bear channel from sitting at the bottom of that channel when zooming out on the daily charts. It might be a little too early to start shorting especially with such a short time frame. I'm looking at the $220-$240 range to see if it will break through but with all the macro at the moment, I'm thinking it'll pop it's head over the trend line and 200ma to trap the bulls before reversing.

To me, 2022 had strangely been following the bear channel a little too orderly and the market makers are switching things up. I noticed SPY always starts a bull run after breaking above the 200 MA and staying above it (this was before it got posted on wsb). This can be seen when zooming out and going back into the last inflation induced recession in the 70s and even further. With retail traders seeing this, market makers could very well manipulate this and it could be the biggest bull trap in history.

With the 10yr-3mo Treasury yield being the most inverted we've ever seen before any previous recessions, if we take the average time of about 1.5 years from the initial inversion, we should be seeing stock capitulation second half of 2023.

But I'm with you on having a bad year so far, sold spy calls that ended up itm so now I'm just relying on theta to decay and may consider rolling them. I've been selling csps to try to hedge that position which helps with losses. I've tried flipping options before but have often found myself in your position. When I get the direction wrong, I try to wait it out or double down, which adds to my losses usually.

It broke through, but i had the feeling that once SPY reached 406.5 that it had gone where it needed to but then the buys would start moving in.  Like i was torn about if it was a dead cat bounce or a reversal, but i guess i settled on reversal. I was also fearing that everyone who sold puts, which were A LOT, would do everything in their power to keep them out of the money today, especially now that soooo many calls that were deep in the green have been reduced to nothing.  Like everyone's 415s, 420s, that range was bought heavy and is now gone.  So, reasonably, if big money controls the price to a degree, they'll want to stay away from the puts people loaded up on yesterday in the 390-405 range.

Yes you aren't wrong about the packaging part which is why I didn't primarily focus on packaging in the DD. 

Selling highly optimized Die attach machines is their true bread and butter and has been the case for the past 10 or so years. In fact they even provide a great example of how prevalent BESI's Die attach machines actually are and I've attached it below (though this is of course a bit of a biased sample). But you can see how many of Besi's machines actually are involved in the process of making these chips.

Semiconductor companies are extremely secretive both about their technology and their general customers for a reason.  Just because they dont publicly broadcast deals doesn't mean they dont exist. 40% market share of just normal Die attach is a lot, 70% market share of Advanced Die placement is crazy.

Right now on a technical basis bulls are in control based on the cpi and jpow speech results. I don't think they look that strong and are getting exhausted well before real resistance. Most likely due to how far the low is below them. That's fear inducing.

Watch the DMI and look for bears to take control on the 4hr and greater time frames. We are either in a topping process or bears are starting to enter. Most likely the big hitters are waiting for FOMC so they don't get blown out. I'd expect some jitters before the meeting. 

Short term is up, but I don't think it can go much farther. I'd sell anything close to 177. (200 day MA)

185ish is the previous peak and also represents overhead supply. Another potential entry point depending on price action

17990,j7u9l7m,t1_j7u89ob,Imo if we go beyond 422/423 we‚Äôre never seeing new lows again. The current chart has severely diverged from liquidity. Liquidity is almost at October low levels (December was lower but that one was a sharp spike due to end of year RRP pump). Whatever is propping the market up rn is not liquidity which is abnormal since markets have been liquidity driven since 2021 with strong direct correlation. This is also why we‚Äôre seeing this wild intraday moves. There‚Äôs no liquidity. Shits getting volatile and choppy. It‚Äôs very diff from prior bear markets because this one is tied to liquidity. I like to reference historical models since bear markets have a lot in common but right now if we get a whiff of bad news or good news really the market will move ALOT. the problem with the bull case is liquidity is proportional to market going up. So we‚Äôre really gonna just drop whenever we do and it‚Äôll be pretty sharp. I think this can also be contributing to the vix ticking up abnormally fast,t3_10xdpkx,1675949350.0,2

17998,j7ujxpq,t1_j7uixo8,Gap fill. It‚Äôs hard to imagine we go lower leaving behind a gap that huge. We‚Äôve left gaps like that in bull market run up but that was fueled by doubling the money supply and QE. However leaving behind a weekly gap is HUGE. I think once it‚Äôs filled we see a sharp rejection. 70% of gaps fill and like 80% once filled we see a reversal of price action. that thing is a magnet on its own. daily gaps are a thing sure but weekly is too huge to leave behind imo. I think we wick up there on CPI or maybe a gap up there and drill. But most likley scenario is a run up into close and a small yet effective rejection on small frames that will be hard to spot to the untrained eye.

It was more than an educated guess, though more to do with positioning on delta and gamma for calls vs puts. 


Also I know for a fact that Nvidia was running through their inventory because I have friends that regularly buy graphics cards and recently the higher end 30XX were getting hard to come by at discounts.

Okay, I love NVDA and I've been trading it up and down last couple of weeks for either short swings, or just intraday momentum plays. I say this to explain that I am somewhat used to staring at the behavior of this chart since I stare at it frequently for hours.

NVDA in the previous two weeks had done 2 round trips from put wall to call wall. I bought these calls right at the hedge wall for nvda at 205 on Tuesday (I think it was just above that price when I bought in). The putwall (highest concentration of puts) was at 200. So hedgewalls are where market makers are delta neutral in options positioning and thus that seems like a good place to get an entry. The second thing I noticed was that there was a compression in the Gamma ratio (16% compression) with the put wall coming up and call wall moving up (which is a bullish indicator). Gamma ratio compression in 2 digits is rare as it is an overall ratio for PutGamma/CallGamma. This again indicated that there was more magnetism to the upside if we did move up on earnings.

Overall this was still a punt (as in all earnings plays are punts), but it was an educated punt based on what I just explained and previous answers upthread.",t3_11aeenc,1677350544.0,3
18033,ja23834,t1_j9zithw,"Thanks a lot for the info. I'll start a trial.  I'm really hoping they have a ""gamma heatmap"" -- eg, showing how much gamma there is at each price point (as opposed to just which price point is the peak).

I'm a bit confused about ""hedgewalls"" meaning dealers are delta neutral. Shouldn't they only be delta neutral at one price point? How can it be the case that they are delta neutral at both the callwall and putwall?

I'm also confused about ""gamma ratio"". From the description it's a measurement of how much gamma comes from puts vs calls... but I'm not sure how a positive ratio implies magnetism to the upside. As I see it, gamma works both ways -- it just makes price more slippery.  If stock moves up, shares bought to hedge calls, shares bought to dehedge puts.  If stock moves down, shares sold to dehedge calls, shares sold to hedge puts.  So, how can it be directional based on how much is from puts vs calls?",t3_11aeenc,1677394827.0,5
18034,ja3nrcs,t1_ja23834,"before you sign up penny, hit me up on discord and I can show you what the platform looks like to see if there is value there for you. 

-----------------------

I think there was a misunderstanding. Hedgewall is indeed one price point (where dealers delta neutral) - put wall is the largest gamma concentration of puts, and similarly for call wall for calls. The safe play usually is the sell put spreads at the put wall, or call spreads at the call wall.",t3_11aeenc,1677429595.0,3
18035,ja3o1qo,t1_ja23834,"regarding gamma ratio, 

what i said was that there was compression over last trading day of the gamma ratio by a large amount, which shows how the ticker was being priced. 16% is one of the largest compressions in gamma ratio I have seen since I have been using the platform",t3_11aeenc,1677429711.0,3

Issuing company stock is not reflected within the income statement. It will show up in the equity and asset portion of the balance sheet, and also within the financing portion of the statement of cash flows. It never touches the income statement.

The only time selling stocks would impact the income statement is if you are selling stock of another company that the company holds. This can be reflected in a few places, depending on the business. It can show up in operating income, if it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs primary business, or it can show up in ‚Äúextraordinary items‚Äù at the bottom of the income statement.

If common stock is sold for a gain like you describe, the excess goes into the equity area of the balance sheet in an account called ‚Äúapic,‚Äù meaning additional paid in capital.

\> The company does not want or need your money creating volatility as you swing in and out of the stock.  

Active trading and swing trading is well known to *reduce* volatility by providing liquidity, it does not increase volatility.   As long as traders are buying low and selling high, it reduces the range of the swings and helps price discovery.    Exaggerated example: if a stock was swinging from 5$ to 10$ but a trader comes in willing to buy everything 6$ or below and sell everything 9$ or higher, the range becomes 6$-9$, thereby reducing volatility.  The impact of many traders combined causes this reduction even though a single one generally can't.  When a single trader can, they are called a market maker.",t3_10fixk7,1674082166.0,5

As far as cpus go, Intel has everything to lose while AMD has everything to gain. Case in point, datacenter. EPYC is uncontested and AMD is taking huge chunks of Intel's datacenter marketshare at will every quarter. 

2. Intel is only competitive because their chips use an insane amount more power than AMD. 13900K @ 253w = 7950X @ 142w. Thats far more than just a node advantage and not remotely close. AMD has the superior architecture, not Intel.

3. ARC is NOT competitive with AMD and Nvidia. You can't compare Intel's flagship to 3 year old AMD and Nvidia entry level gpus and claim that. The 770 is roughly on par with competition flagships from 8-9 years ago. So complete and utter dogshit compared to the 4090 or 7900XTX.

7. TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries are building fabs stateside, or already have fabs set up and are funded by the CHIPS Act. Intel isn't going to be the only option if Tawain gets invaded. 

8. Most software libraries are written for Cuda. Nvidia essentially has a monopoly on AI due to that alone.

What a shitpost 

This post is wack.  These are the same things folks have discussed for years!!

1- intel design is not better in CPU.  They have a huge disadvantage in battery life and efficiency.  The only reason they hold on to market share is they spend a lot to build there moat.

2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago‚Ä¶.. when they had a technology lead!!  Now they are 2-3 years behind.

3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment‚Ä¶. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.

4- profits are going to decrease tremendously‚Ä¶. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry‚Ä¶.how will they compete but on cost?

5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space‚Ä¶. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?

Their Tower Semi, Altera and foundry plays are going to do well. Note MOST semiconductors are not leading edge and driven by Moore's Law reductions. Older fabs print money.   

Their ARC GPU's are a decent first effort but in Intel fashion - late to the party. Their drivers are a hot mess and it will be 3 years before they are on par with NVIDIA or AMD.  Note ARC has no AI/Tensorcores which is what is making NVIDIA the winner.   Intels AI is damn good but is not showing the commitment needed.  With regard to datacenter, Intel is a chip player. Nvidia is a chip player and box and network builder.  Intel has all the pieces but fails to execute. I have to wonder if they are handicapped by NOT competing against their customers. As for their customers - ARM (which Intel had and dumped on Marvell) is King of the Core. Most server farm (especially virtualization) is ARM based.  Alibaba made their own server chip (128 cores/ 128 PCI lanes supporting 16 GPUS) which leaves Intel in the dust.

IMHO Intel has indecisive, risk averse leadership and really poor marketing vision right now.

Remember Itanium (aka Merced) ? Meanwhile AMD leapfrogged them in the 64 bit space.

What was that division they started to make chips for digital televisions and ended up folding after less than a year ? At the time, the NYT ran a story about the prototypes being turned into a very expensive disco ball.

What about mobile ? There was an effort at Intel to get x86 chips into Android devices. I am vaguely familiar with it because the company I worked for at the time in the mobile space, was solicited to test one of their chips . Nothing came of it. I think some Samsung 10 inch tablet did use an x86 Intel processor but it also contained some hardware so it could run ARM code.


Speaking of ARM, they've lost the Apple market. And it wouldn't surprise me if, over the next couple of years, Microsoft also ramped up their support for ARM.


Even in the data center, there are companies playing with non x86 architectures. And Moore's Law having slowed down significantly since the early 2000's, for some players, general purpose processors aren't cutting it anymore.


Intel's last quarter of a century has been an unmitigated disaster. They survive thanks to their legacy businesses, none of which are safe. Management has been uniformly incompetent. Thankfully they didn't spin off their manufacturing or they'd.already be dead.

19367,jmtwhks,t3_1402a71,">1. I agree that Nvidia's current pricing is unsustainable, but their products are still superior to AMD's in many ways.
2. Current generation Intel CPUs are indeed competitive with AMD's offerings, despite the fact that AMD has an advantage when it comes to manufacturing process node sizes. This shows that Intel has a superior design team and they are able to compete even though they don't have the same manufacturing advantages as AMD.
3. Nvidia's first generation GPUs (ARC) were indeed competitive with last generation Nvidia/AMD cards, and next generation cards from both companies will likely be better with driver updates and new features added by manufacturers such as AIB partners.. However, I believe that NVIDIA holds the overall performance lead due to their years of experience in developing high-performance graphics hardware. They also have more resources dedicated to R&D than any other company in this market segment which gives them a clear advantage moving forward.

May even be less competitive, as presumably they couldn't achieve the same clock speed - they should be more power efficient though. 

Their CPU designs are good, but their node is not as bad as you seem to think when it comes to raw performance. It has been said their fab teams have carried their design teams somewhat, and that needs to change if they want to become an open foundry.

Even with my pessimistic view of Intel, there's a decent upside if they pull things together. They're probably going to miss this AI boom though, their focus is more existential than growth/opportunity as they cut projects.

The OP's theory is based around the CCP acting though.  I think if Taiwan does get invaded, there will be lots of Taiwanese looking for a new home.  Similar to the fall of Saigon.  There would be a hasty, mass exodus (including semiconductor talent).

Beyond this, Fab21 won't be supplying the world with semiconductors, but primarily the United States and allies.  And they already have plans to greatly increase the capacity (5 fold, from 20k to 100k WSPM).

I think, beyond CCP acting, it will stay relatively small.  There are already large complaints about working conditions at the TSMC Fabs.  Long hours and very strict.  That clashes with modern Western work ethic.

Of course one cannot predict the future.   But you can base your long term positions on stable companies with strong forward guidance and a clear plan to get there.   And that's my point. 

It doesn't matter if a company's earnings have decreased in the past.  The past is the past.  All that matters is what they are doing today and what they are building for the future.

If you were just looking at the past, in 2015 when it was trading under 2/sh, you'd have missed AMD's meteoric rise.  And it only rose because they had a competent plan for the future, the right leadership to execute that plan, and the right market conditions to grow.

But Waller is a voting member and he basically says it's not looking as good as he thought it did in January. I found the following comments neutral at best.

""...if \[job creation and CPI inflation\] continue to come in too hot, the policy taraget range will have to be raised this year even more...""

""I would be very pleased if the data we receive on inflation and the labor market this month show signs of moderation, which would suggest that the February data releases were just a bump in the road and that progress is continuing. But wishful thinking is not a substitute for hard evidence, in the form of economic data. After seeing promising signs of progress, we can risk a revival of inflation. Policymakers must remain data dependent, so my view will depend on what the data say.""

if you look at MoM CPI it is pretty clear that headline inflation is dragged up by the first half of 2022, especially Apr/Jun/Jul with 1%+ MoM increase. With how weak inflation in 2nd half of the year, headline figure will come down very naturally to near 2% over the next 6 month. Imo this is why market reacted so positively at the last FOMC despite Jpow having a rather hawkish tone, it is the first time the FED acknowledges this and it signaled the end of rate hikes.

You said today looked pretty bullish for Monday but I actually think it‚Äôs not so obvious. Energy had a monster day off of some oil news (Russia cutting production) which gave Spy a lot of strength. Vix had a pullback but it‚Äôs < 1% after pumping > 10% over 2 days. Treasuries yields have been rising steadily over the same period which is theoretically bearish but algos have something else in mind. Also I‚Äôve been watching MSFT/AAPL like a hawk. They make up something like 11%/22% of SPY/QQQ respectively. Both giants missed earnings/gave poor outlooks but they‚Äôre both by and large higher than pre-earnings (MSFT is way up off of AI abuzz).

EA refocusing Battlefield or Titanfall into a true competitor is a real possibility when they can rely on the fact that they dont compete with CoD on arguably the biggest platform so they have a very open audience to sell to.

Or maybe Sony decides to get their literal legendary FPS studio they just acquired (Bungie) to help make a competing product.

CoD isn't nearly as unbeatable as this whole acquisition narrative has played up. Prior to CoD MW 2018 (I think it was 2018?) CoD was in serious fucking trouble with middling releases back to back to back and Battlefield seemed poised to make a real grab at the belt before fumbling fucking hard after Battlefield 1. If BFV and 2049 had actually landed well we might be talking about how CoD is in depserate need to shake things up. Instead BF literally fell to pieces to the point that the studio was completely overhauled and now is starting from ground zero again trying to build back their audience.

I honestly think if CoD goes exclusive some new FPS will come in and make waves enough to make the whole purchase undeserved.",t3_1180yba,1677002927.0,4

I dont want to baghold TSLA and with that lame event surely people will probably be dumping. so i might dump my other 50 and switch to shorting instead. Never have luck with TSLA it seems...

I've been doing well with 3/17 395 puts and SQQQ calls, buying on tops of upswings and peicemeal selling them for 80-100 dollar gains slowly. With todays close and TSLA sucking really hard I expect us to open lower tomorrow to start. SPY dropped a buck and a half probably since 4:15PM probably soley from the TSLA event.

I still have a fuckton of calls at the moment including XOM, MCD, HRL, DAL, PSA, MDLZ. Probably around 25k worth of calls and they are all red at the moment. Mostly june dated. planning to exit if we get back to 4000, if not might need to exit many of those. My SPY puts and SQQQ have been offsetting those losses but i'm getting low on buying power.

Looking to re-enter UNG at 8.5 if it gets there, made decent coin on UNG calls too this week.

Market breadth thrust seems to be occurring based on today, so seems like almost everything is starting to advance. 

I think it‚Äôs the volume too. It‚Äôs been terrible this entire year. Seems like most major institutions prolly sold the February top, which is why we aren‚Äôt seeing massive selling any more. 

I wasn‚Äôt necessarily calling for a major 2008 crash. Thought we would get back to 3400 on s&p and then massively melt up w the fed pause. I‚Äôm thinking more and more that it‚Äôs unlikely. Shit earnings and another bank crisis domino could get us there, but I doubt it. 

Think there could be a pull back w earnings season, but it‚Äôll prolly stall at December lows.

And yeah once the fed pauses historically it‚Äôs been really bullish for stocks.

The real 2008 crash will prolly happen after the fed pivots and that will be after we melt up. Maybe it‚Äôs to all time highs or the march highs around 4600.",t3_11a9amh,1680139018.0,1
20247,je80fc7,t1_je7v9p6,"Yeah, I thought we'd hit 320 last year, in december if you had told me 340, i would have said you're optimistic. What's made this bear market very weird is that historically, bear markets begin until 9 months AFTER the fed begins to rise rates. They usually continue to rally until then. We actually began 3 months EARLY to decline in anticipation of the rate hikes. Highly unusual. I hate to say this phrase, but we very early on in the season started to price in the economic slowdown, and massive hedges were bought, so this ruined everything for bears since the trade got overcrowded. Also, the irony is that this being the most anticipated recession in history, companies already began since last year cutting back on inventory, expense, and personnell. Ironically this action of cutting back on excess in anticipation of a recession (reduction of supply) already removes the excess that causes a slump from decreased demand. Which then dampens the effects of the economic cycle where a contraction shocks the corporate world. But here they've already contracted activity themselves. LOL.",t3_11a9amh,1680141395.0,1
20248,je85qf6,t1_je80fc7,"Yeah I think it‚Äôs because in the past fed tightening cycles were slow as shit. It‚Äôd be like 25 bps over 6 months. Everyone realized inflation was awful and Fed was gonna have to go super fast since they got behind the curve. I do think this recession and credit crunch is about to be bad. Credit card debt and commercial real estate are about to implode. These rate hikes act w a lag. 

Prolly won‚Äôt see the full effects until 3Q 2023 and the actual implosion sometime in 2024. Every time Fed got rates to 5% over the past 20 years, they popped the economy and market hard. With the leverage in the system and the pace at which they did the rate hikes, more dominoes will fall. 

But for now, I‚Äôm bullish until earnings. Too many shorts that are gonna cover massively. Plus, the inflation data will likely b bullish since y/y is coming down from strong base effects. It‚Äôs stupid to look only at y/y, but that‚Äôs what the market is going to care about.",t3_11a9amh,1680143878.0,1

3. So, repurchase your 70 shares of Nvidia immediately, unless you're betting on the stock price to fall even lower.

Yes when you short shares, someone is buying them - in this case the person who held a short 180 put and was assigned to purchase 100 shares from you, the holder of the long put - and the money they spend on those shares goes to your account. Like you have noticed, you can't withdraw or invest the majority of that cash because it is collateral for your short position.

If nvidia keeps going down, the amount of that cash you can use will go up by $70 for every dollar nvidia drops, but actually using/withdrawing it is a slippery slope because if nvidia recovers, the amount of that cash that you ""own"" will decrease, also by $70 for every dollar the stock price rises.

If the ~$6K in cash you can access is invested or withdrawn and nvidia goes up even a little you will immedately be margin called. If nvidia keeps going up and you don't have cash to dump back into the account, you will *lose everything in the account by the time the platform closes your short position for you.*",t3_wtljlp,1661064056.0,3

 ‚ÄúThis is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.

In this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in ""puts"", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.

To fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.

The story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.

The TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: ""Buy NVDA puts"", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop. The meteor emojis ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è are used to symbolize a dramatic fall.‚Äù",t3_13k37ln,1684356111.0,2

20618,jkotnsl,t3_13lb98n,">Why $700 next year:
* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year. The market has already priced this in. 
* AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time 
* FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700",t3_13lb98n,1684444885.0,2

20731,j1xew40,t1_j1x1zwd,"I‚Äôm referring to JPM‚Äôs trading desk, which currently owns a 40k contract protective collar on SPX presumably as a way to manage their portfolio‚Äôs risk. The collar expires at the end of this week, and most of the market impact will be caused by the SPX 3835c they sold to fund the downside put spread (the put spread is way OTM and worthless at this point, and therefore won‚Äôt have much market impact). 

Given the size of the position, and the lack of liquidity/catalysts this time of year, the huge gamma of the call position with SPX currently at 3829 will likely pin the market around the 3835 strike until expiration. To put it simply, if the market rallies above the 3835 strike, market makers holding the calls will have to sell S&P futures, and conversely, if the market falls below the 3835 strike, they‚Äôll have to buy S&P futures, thereby pulling the market from either direction towards the 3835 strike.

Once the collar is rolled out on Friday, the pinning action of the position will become largely irrelevant until the end of March, allowing the market to move more freely once we enter the new year.

20738,j22s696,t1_j1xew40,Can you explain why the market makers would have to sell futures if the market moves up and buy if it goes down?,t3_zwtho8,1672293260.0,1

20740,j22uhzg,t1_j22s696,"Market makers always want to remain delta neutral, since their business model is about providing liquidity and profiting from the bid-ask spread; they‚Äôre not trying to predict market movements. Because JPM sold the calls, the market makers are long those calls, and therefore they need to hedge those calls accordingly so that they remain delta neutral. This can be done, for example, by shorting futures with an equal delta. (If it‚Äôs on a stock or etf they‚Äôll usually just use the underlying to hedge. SPX does not have a direct underlying so they have to hedge in other ways)

The problem for market makers is that calls (and puts) have convexity, also known as gamma. So, in this case, when the price moves upwards, the delta of the 3835 calls increases, thereby requiring the market makers to hedge the increased delta by shorting more futures. Or, on the contrary, when the price falls, the delta of the calls falls, so the market makers will cover some of their futures shorts. Hence the ‚Äúpinning‚Äù action.",t3_zwtho8,1672294771.0,2

I too believe that he isnt cheating. I mean how can you. But Chess community has gone crazy just because they now have a villian to scapegoat. I too sometimes in my game is able to beat a 1800 even though i'm a 1400-1500 Elo player. Doesnt mean im cheating lol.


The only thing bothering people is :

1. His analysis of firouza game which hikaru mocked that it isnt a 2700 analysis. Even the interviewer was beating him who is a 2500 elo player.

2. And the other is this rumor that magnus game plan was leaked beforehand which then hans analysed before game using chess engine coz it was the first time in long time when magnus never really had a chance to win since the beginning.

3.  Also hans said in an interview he looked at the game before but ppl are arguing magnus never played this opening ever. But there is a thing in chess which is called transposition which somehow reaches same pattern about 2-3yrs ago. But analysing that just one random game out of million of magnus games is very fishy.",t3_x852ch,1662605888.0,2

21078,jmy2rvx,t3_13zoesw,"*""Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?""*

It has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a ""timeless brand."" That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.

Bob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.

When they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN ""addicts,"" who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.

Ironically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political ""battles."" He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.

If Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.

I'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube.",t3_13zoesw,1685935582.0,1

A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.

Stocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.

Bonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship‚Äîwhen demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease.",t3_13u0n86,1685307775.0,2

21339,jm6z4ya,t1_jm6udmp,"A scalp to the upside if momentum is there. Still not too interested in the upside here unless we can build a demand wall at 420. But here's what I see...

On the M15 chart, our trading range is between 422.92 and 419.78, with the current trade happening in the upper part of this range. We have a Fair Value Gap (FVG) of 420.75 to 422.04 which could be filled if we notice a shift in trend at 421.94. If such a trend shift occurs, I'll search for chances to buy in the discount zone and at the 15-minute order block (420.49 - 419.78). Bullish investors must maintain the price above 419.21. If the price drops below 419.21, we'll focus on the hourly Fair Value Gaps and order block.

Buy-side Discounts:

* 421.34 (50%)
* 420.97 (62%)
* 420.72 (70%)
* 420.44 (79%)
* 419.78(100%). 

Targets: 

* 422.92 (0%) (T.P. 1)
* 413.77 (-27%) (T.P. 2)
* 424.87 (-62%) (T.P. 3)
* I plan to set out today if it runs and catch it to the downside.  Here is what I'm looking at, though.

21504,jpaeou0,t3_14h37j8,"The banking bailout raised the balance sheet, but it's a fundamentally different transaction than standard QE. With normal QE, the Fed buys treasuries and forces investors to put their money elsewhere (ie the stock market). The bailout was an act of preserving deposits. Yeah, letting those deposits burn would have taken money out of the system, but that money sitting idly by and saving it didn't inject more money into the economy the same way that normal QE does.

Do I think that the Fed will eventually pivot, drop rates and stop QT? Of course... But it will take a lot more than a few bank failures. Like I said, the bailout wasn't to save the market, it was to save bank deposits. The Fed doesn't really care about the market as much as people think. It's mandate is to keep unemployment low and the economy/prices stable. The Fed would only care about the market if it dropped so low that it affected those things. This is possible, but it would probably take something lower than S&P 3000 for that to happen.

Like most people, you're focusing too much on the Fed, and not enough (or at all) on the Treasury. The market hasn't gone up the last few months because of the bailout. The market has gone up because the Treasury hasn't been issuing the new debt that it needs to in order to cover the deficit for the year. It anticipated issuing 1.65T in new debt for the year. It's only done 650B YTD and still needs to do 1T more before Oct.  There was quite a bit of money in maturing treasuries that wasn't rolled into new issues. Instead, it was released back into the economy, and is most likely what caused the the upswing.

Now, that money will get sucked back into the Treasury over the next few months and put into treasuries. I'm betting that we have a pretty solid decline into Oct...

Sure, the market might rebound after that and rally up through the end of the year. However, while interest rates are high, it will always gravitate down.  The deficit will continue to grow and, eventually, will attain critical mass. It will start to pull money out of the economy and market faster than it can cycle back around and be put in. Just like has happened in the past, that's when things will break.",t3_14h37j8,1687564319.0,8

I always am cautious when I try to attribute one variable for determining market direction. QT is important to be aware of because it increases long term borrowing and subsequently increasing WACC. However, even if QT and hikes continue there is still a possibility companies have readjusted for more costly expansion. 

I agree with you that markets will probably continue an upward trend, but I believe this will still happened even with QT or hikes.

The Fed gets most of the attention, but I think that the Treasury operations is where the rubber meets the road on the macro economics level. I've been going through the Treasury statements for the past few years. I haven't gone as far as statistical analysis and computing an r value or anything, but at a glance it appears that there is a very high correlation between the cash flow of the Treasury and the movement of the market in the weeks that follow.

Raising interest rates this high basically starts a time bomb. It's just a matter of time before servicing the US debt becomes too overwhelming.

These things take a while to play out. We won't be in the clear until interest rates go back down, a year has passed, and all the t bills that were issued under high interest rates roll off the books.

They have a solid business plan and their earnings calls give you confidence that their leadership has the right goals.

If you‚Äôre into the more tinfoil side of things, their stock is also heavily-shorted to the mechanical limit. FTD‚Äôs as a high ratio of volume traded are a regular occurrence, as well as cycling on and off of RegSHO.

Bear case: recently did layoffs, liabilities increasing, high interest rates means less loan volume. High short interest means that somebody has a better bear case than I do apparently.

21682,igau1yi,t1_iga1e19,"For the Year 2021,  
Intel Revenue : $79B, with $19.9B in profit.  
AMD Revenue : $16.4B, with $3.16B in profit.  
Nvidia revenue : $26.39B, with $9.75B in profit.

While Intel's profit margins are shit, Their profit is > Nvidia and Amd's combined, and then some. However, TSMC is essentially raping them.  
TSMC's revenue is around $55B, profit at \~ $20B, which is insane. But there is an additional geopolitical risk of TSMC. China might decide to China. And that's probably priced in to their market Cap. Let's take a look at those numbers.

NVIDIA : $391B  
Intel : $154B  
AMD : $129.36

They've all fallen, but Nvidia's fall has been something worth seeing. Almost Netflixesque. Intel, as a function of it's size serves a lot more markets. Some mature, and some new and upcoming. AMD and Nvidia serve a lot of the newer growth markets, because of which their stock is valued as a growth stock.

So while AMD and Nvidia get all the glamour, Intel, chugs along, making mountains of more money every year.

Intel's ace in the hole is Manufacturing. They make their own shit, in America. (And everywhere else. Take a globe, point at a random country whose name sounds vaguely familiar, Intel likely has an office there) 

The fabless manufacturers get them made elsewhere, primarily by TSMC.  With geopolitical sentiment trending towards building in house capabilities to manufacture things, Intel may be uniquely positioned to deliver what it's peers can't. Further, I'd be willing to bet, that one day, in the not so distant future, Intel makes chips for Nvidia and  AMD, which would be hilarious to see.",t3_vzo788,1657912237.0,7

They set an aggressive node schedule and appear to be sticking to it two years later. The combo should give them  the x86 advantage again.

Lots of other stock have room to grow. Intel does too, it's just a much riskier play. Do you trust Intel to have a decent quarter? If not, I would buy something else.

Similar to Apple, relying on the most advanced technology to produce their custom chips. 

I doubt the cloud AI partnership. Offering these big machine learning farms is an investment risk and might have short product cycles, depending on the evolution of ML hardware design. 

Both Amazon and Google and certainly Microsoft as well focus very heavily on optimizing their data centers regarding power consumption and cooling. I personally cannot imagine they will suddenly buy billions of NVidia chips. 

Personally I also don‚Äôt like to call it AI, but stick to machine learning. 
Nothing we have seen hyped up has a big commercial roadmap.

Oh come on bro. Twenty years ago Apple was worth 5 billion, less than half a percent of Nvidia's current worth.

To pretend as though buying a trillion dollar company in 2023 could even begin to give the same results over twenty years as Apple in 2003 is criminal. The fact is Nvidia will likely do well over the long term, but is also grossly overpriced with insane expectations. If Nvidia does even a 10x over the next decade or two it likely means that AI has become one of the top primary economic drivers.

I think you will see software companies in the AI space they to design their own proprietary chips to circumvent NVDA.

At the same time, I wouldn't inverse and advocate going long here either.  I have some humility to say that I just don't know.

The one call that I will make on it is that I think that NVDA stock will be under $200 sometime within the next 0-2 years when hype momentum is exhausted, growth comes in less than the stock has it priced for, and valuation matters again.",t3_13jjd1d,1684278264.0,8

Nvidia and its CUDA software stack are far better than anything out there on offer. AMD, Intel, and others dropped the ball years ago when they didn't properly support and push for OpenCL. It doesn't help that Nvidia never fully supported it and actively made it the poorer choice performance wise for their cards. It's so bad that OpenCL 3 is actually a rollback to OpenCL 1.2 and makes everything from OpenCL 2 optional.

So now, with the failure of OpenCL AMD and Intel have decided on their own proprietary implementations. These will take longer than 2 years to catch up to Nvidia, if they ever do.

Thankfully, I think AMD is doing the right thing in making it so that they can convert CUDA to their chips. Only time will tell.

The other potential open option would be a Vulcan compute, but Nvidia has made this out to not be a viable option on their cards. Apparently, their drivers seem to set things improperly.

A decade ago no GPU manufacturer at all purchased time on whatever the latest node was. They went for the cheaper and more mature older fabs.  High yields. Reliable. Fleshed out.

They ran into a problem because the rent-a-fabs each skipped a generation for one reason or another between 28nm and 16/14nm, a break in the hand-me-down fab progression, so the gpu makers started competing for the latest fabs for their gpus.

Forward P/E with the current downside risk isn't a good indicator imo. Equities are expensive but the concentration into certain stocks is probably where the risk is and why markets might fall in the near-term.


Positioning probably doesn't let the market fall too much without a credit event, so I agree earning theta is the way. I see big sector rotations coming depending on how the big names report this week.",t3_12woh5b,1682297323.0,2

22443,jo10waf,t1_jo06cd5,"It was a word of caution for those who do not research tech (vs stock technical analysis etc) .  Its a wide open market and as such prone to volatility.  That's not to say that say Intel's AI projects will not shoot themselves in the foot but likely not. Its ""technically"" a slam dunk. Same for AMD. Now Intel could do very well because they own their own fabs which NVIDIA does not. Look at Intel's up and coming GPUs - for a first shot - very very good. (Mostly a software problem.)  Note that the other GPU market was Crypto Mining. Intel made an incredible chip for Crypto - and released it RIGHT when the market tanked.  

Second bit for the non-techies - A model - once trained is very portable. So it can start on NVIDIA today but migrate tomorrow. This is not ""non-portable Windows"" that only runs on one platform.

22444,jo0lbwn,t1_jo06cd5,If the tools are open source competitors can read the code and try to  imitate the product or build a compatible alternative. That's bad for Nvidia.

They may drive standardization in the OpenCompute path.  Note that they rolled their own because they had to.  NVIDIA was a late comer and really added a little AI to support gaming speed and image ray tracing. But once you have the capability you find uses for it.  ChatGPT was a nuclear event. [Open.AI](https://Open.AI)  changed the conversation and NVIDIA pivoted for the benefit but really most of these AI plays are suboptimal in comparison to the real deal.,t3_148i6as,1686768453.0,1

22449,jo0epti,t1_jo0ax6r,"A vast majority of semi companies are fabless.  They have run allocation in their contracts.  Fabs will build their wafers and store them for eventual orders. Nothing new.  Keep in mind that not all semis require the latest submicron (becoming angstrom) fabs. Most power components do not and cannot.

Where you see these fabs are in ultra leading edge high volume (commodity) markets. Specifically SOC's (cell phones et al), DRAM, FLASH, CPUs and GPUs. 

Fabs are so expensive that even the big cash cows (Apple) do not spin up their own. 

What will be interesting is as big and high margin the Datacenter is - the gaming GPU market had the volume for NVIDIA the last I heard.  NVIDIA plays all sorts of games to make sure the product designed for one is not used in the other - in an attempt to preserve margins.  Some workarounds have evolved.",t3_148i6as,1686676074.0,1

22451,jo4tmi8,t1_jo2wxqc,"Quantum computers are a niche - they are not general purpose computers and do not displace everything available today.  Quantum has tremendous AI potential but has to overcome a scalability curve to be useful. Quantum CAN displace NVIDIA CUDA cores but not AI Tensorcores as readily but we will see how this evolves.

Quantum datacenters will be a thing and to the extent that that space is where NVIDIA is entrenched its logical that NVIDIA will need to participate. They likely will buy one of the many quantum startups when the timing makes sense.  But note the Quantum stuff is so hard to make and very specialized at the moment.  Big ticket item.",t3_148i6as,1686767754.0,1

Like NVIDIA, I expect the AI chip guys (rolling out Tensorcores to have to address the interconnect themselves to have a holistic solution. This is NOT a TCPIP Ethernet solution space at all. Don't care how fast you make it.",t3_148i6as,1686767178.0,1
22454,jo4rgcl,t1_jo3hsdi,True. But CUDA cores and Tensorcores are apples and oranges. CUDA codebases do not port to Tensorcore.  Tensorflow is the open source standard for AI/ML and everyone supports it.  That said some Cloud providers are NVIDIA houses and will stick with their solution because it can be reconfigured on the fly for old CUDA uses.,t3_148i6as,1686766858.0,1
22455,jo5iqt7,t1_jo4z1sb,And many other fabless guys. And that is not changing anytime soon. And of course there is GlobalFoundries.  Intel coming at some point and they bought Jazz for non-leading edge geometries.,t3_148i6as,1686778342.0,2

Whether it‚Äôs cheaper to buy a gpu from nvidia or develop your own hardware for your commercial product comes down to what company it is. And again, 99% of startups are software based. None of them will do that

Recall NVIDIA even before the Mellanox acquisition had GPU interconnects - first SLI then NVLINK.  AMD had Crossfire.  What they found was as the chips got faster getting on and off the board to adjacent boards really slowed the thing down. Note that ALL manufactures had this issue which is why many CPU's are now ""chiplets"" - bringing high speed stuff onto the same chip package to reduce the travel time.  GPU's and CPU's take a byte of data and chew.  Tensorecores just suck data like a vacuum and if the model is large and many Tensorcores are needed the interconnect has to keep up or it, like SLI of old, will choke the throughput.

Can you clarify, who will outperform?  SOFI?  Or money center banks?

You say SOFI is blue chip clients but my impression is its young people, young graduates.  Hence why they've been slammed every time there's a student loan related headline.  

One theory is if the GOP succeeds in killing off the remaining parts of student loan forgiveness (most people don't realize there's already been a lot of beneficial student loan relief) that could be good for SOFI, who will basically be the go-to institution of choice for that brand demographic.",t3_10ohc1a,1675029128.0,2

Rocket is where young and first time and less affluent go, so their market is shrinking.  And the RE conglomerates would have no need as they get their own financing.

On the other hand, supposedly big banks including WFC are ceding the mortgage origination territory to outfits like Rocket, so whatever business there is coming available, they'd have a shot at.  And it seems to me that other than advertising, rocket is set up to only make money on every deal.  In other words, they only pay out the big commisions and costs when a deal closes and by definition they'd only close deals that work.  Costs would be self correcting then.  Ie: it's the unicorn business model that should have guaranteed break-even or better operations at any scale. (Again, leaving out advertising of course)

$amd ran ~30% on a bombshell that nvidia is skullfucking them.  i don't know how anyone could see nvda's er/q2 guide and think it's good for amd.  amd already guided.  

amd's event yesterday was a commercial for nvidia.  they claimed a $30B 2023 TAM and then said they won't have products til 2024.

amd has no software.  it's cuda vs... open source.

the first bunch of mi300s are headed to el capitan for low margin.

they refused to show any benchmarks vs the h100, so the performance is still a big unknown.

amd also just wasted ~90% of the presentation talking about epyc, which is now basically rendered moot.  epyc is the superior datacenter cpu... but datacenter is now pulling a 180 and switching to being gpu-centric, via the ai play.

I have plenty of money, but I can't justify spending more than ~$800+ on a GPU. I think the prices are insane for Nvidia's cards and think they shot themselves in the foot. A 3060 ti is usually more than enough for 99% of games at 1080p, which is what most people are still on. 

I'll be surprised if they beat earnings. Very few people are buying 4090 GPUs, and people overall have less disposable income. 

The only CPU/GPU company I think we will see clearly beat earnings is Intel. Their new 13th generation CPUs are arguably better for most use cases than AMD chips, and they cost quite a bit less than the AMD chips competing at each price point. 

Also, apparently Intel Arc GPUs are selling fairly well, based on rumors. 

I'm biased against Nvidia right now though. They took advantage of the market when crypto was still gobbling up GPUs. Then the CEO says that ""Moore's law is dead"" to try to justify their 4000 series price gouging while they hold back lower tier 4000 series cards.

My guess is that in 5-10 years the only thing people have at home is a monitor with a thin client, and games are simply played in a cloud where you pay for a subscription.

For the record, yes I have ""bags"".  I also made a nice load of money from 2017 to 2021 from mining and sold for a profit.  I have been mining since 2011.

As of right now, mining is ""dead"" and has zero impact on the pricing of cards and has not since Ethereum swapped to proof of stake.  Unless you have free electricity right now, everything is mined at a loss that has NOTHING to do with 4000s/3000s/2000s or whatever other bullshit you want to believe from nvidia.

I was making profit all day on 3060 12gb and 3070.  Easy 40-50Mhs on 50% power draw. $0.10 kwh.

You really have not researched anything and your echochamber wherever you hang out is not research.  Look around more, son.

\*2 Thanks to this trick of buying a put and a call at the same time you ensure that you will win in any case because you have both bets to the upside and downside

BTW, this trick is super secret, don't tell your friends or we are screwed because everyone will start doing this

Intel wasted too much time on non-core activities. The GPU investment was a fiasco. Optane, Mobileye. All jokes. They can't get their datacenter CPU out and keep losing where it matters.

Nvidia overdid the crypto and GPU markets. They have billions in RTX 3000 series, which they can't sell. They screwed around with Tesla (and lost them), they did the same with TSMC (and now they are back... but trying to reschedule production). They're royally screwed. Their attempt at ARM also failed. Jensen ain't laughing no more.

Meanwhile, Xilinx and AMD are doing GREAT. EPYC is growing faster than all businesses (which is where the margins are). Consoles will do great on Q3, as it is generally the BEST quarter for sales.

RDNA3 APUs will own handhelds, gaming and portable.

Where is Microsoft getting revenue then? Where do they plan to get revenue? Some people say game pass but $15/month is a quick expense trim for anyone with a tightening budget, especially if there isn‚Äôt a must-play game on that system.

Once again, you demonstrate your financial ignorance.  You must get crushed in the market.  As I said much earlier, P&L has nothing to do with revenue or margins.  Expenses include CapEx which is plant.  Intel is building new plants like crazy.  That is clobbering CapEx today but will pay big in the future.  (it is also driving ASML results as they are a key supplier to Intel fabs).  They screwed up on the PC product cycle and likely wrote off a lot of plant investments that support PC chips.  That is what a relatively new CEO will do, while the Board still has patience with him.  It is called flushing expenses, current and future, which helps the bottom line later on and supports a nice clean, well subscribed spinout as the company splits in two.  I have owned GE (bought at the bottom) for years and they are doing the same thing: spinning out their BUs after first setting them up for success.  I think it is funny that you are trying to outthink me on INTC and NVDA because you clearly have no clue.  Keep it up.  I love mopping the floor with you",t3_14f84hz,1687458924.0,1

that's where you're wrong.  if intel's margins were as high as nvidia's, they'd be swimming in $.  but intc's margins are down to the 30s... and nvda's are around 70.

23171,jp4qr7y,t1_jp4hn0q,"Just keep it up....I will continue to school you since you have no idea what you are talking about.  I hope you actually learn something.  NVDA has high margins because they have no manufacturing.  They are like a software company that way.  All they have is sales, marketing and accounting costs.  It is not quite as good as software because they do have to purchase the chips they sell from their contract fab, like TSMC and so they do have a Cost of Goods Sold, which is 30% of revenue.  The basic formula for manufacturing accounting is: Rev - COGS = gross margin (GM).  GM - SG&A = net profit.  But SG&A are most of their expenses, the other 70% less profits of 18%.  So their SG&A is 52%, which is much more than Intel.  NVDA have no plant to depreciate, but their suppliers like TSMC do and so that depreciation is just transferred to the COGS which are the chips purchased for resale.  INTC, which always wanted to have the best global chip manufacturing capability to enhance its own margins, always had its own production.  And it was the best chip fab money could buy.  So they always have had high COGS, including the plant depreciation and lower SG&A than NVDA.  But they had the best gross margins as their chips outperformed.  But they also were able to create a competitive advantage through that vertical integration.  Now, they are finally acknowledging they have lost that global production advantage.  TSMC caught up to them and passed them on manufacturing productivity (using the same tool manufacturers as Intel: AMAT, KLA and ASML).  Now NVDA and even AMD, which was always behind INTC in chip performance for decades, has caught INTC.  The decision is obvious: split the high cost business of fabrication off into its own company so it is compared in the market with TSMC, UMC, Global (includes what was IBM's fab) and Micron and set up a separate chip design company like NVDA, AMD (which used to have its own fab before spinning off what became Global), Qualcom and Marvell.  INTC will have comparable margins in its chip design business as NVDA, once it has spun off the fabs.  That reality is not yet in the stock price.
