**Apple Magically Defies Gravity**

Apple Inc (ticker: AAPL) released the first iPhone in the United States on June 29, 2007. In 2008, Apple Inc. posted revenue of $7.9 billion for its fiscal 2008 fourth quarter ended September 27, 2008. According to Apple’s latest financial reports, the company’s current revenue (TTM) is $385.09 billion. **Apple has experienced unparalleled revenue growth, from just $8 billion (USD) in 2004 to more than $394 billion in 2022.**

Valued at over $2 trillion in 2021, Apple became the most valuable technology company in the world. Steve Jobs, the founder and CEO, was one of technology’s first “rock stars”, able to sell hardware as more than a tool for work.

Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, and the company saw a gradual decline over the 1990s. It struggled to compete with Microsoft's Windows, and computer manufacturers like Dell Computers, and Apple hardware sales fell.

On the verge of bankruptcy, and in a last-ditch effort to save the company, Apple brought Jobs back and installed him as CEO. Jobs then miraculously managed to get a $150 million loan from arch nemesis Bill Gates. This cash infusion allowed Apple to stave off bankruptcy, and also gave them the financial wherewithal to develop new products. Then Jobs hit a product homerun with the iPod. He turned the company’s fortunes around, launching iTunes and the iPod in 2001.

The release of the iPhone saw Apple ascend to one of the most valuable companies in the world, with revenue increasing from $37.4 billion in 2008 to $65 billion in 2010.

The success of the iPhone enabled Apple to launch new product categories, such as the iPad. Apple envisioned the tablet as a bridge between the smartphone and laptop, with the capabilities to be both. Yet, as iPhone revenues began to stagnate, Apple looked for new ways to generate revenue from the iPhone.

**Apple Uses iPhone Reverse Loss Leader Strategy?**

A loss leader strategy involves selling a product or service at a lower price that is not profitable. The product is sold cheaply to attract new customers, or to sell additional products and services to its existing customers. Although iPhone sales began to flag, after being on the market for the better part of a decade, Apple instituted what appears to be a reverse loss leader strategy by raising iPhone prices. And Apple used the high-priced iPhone to introduce customers to new services or products in the hopes of building a customer base and securing future recurring revenue.

Then Apple got into the headphone business. In 2014 Apple acquired Beats Music and Beats Electronic, which produced audio headphones, and had a subscription streaming music service, for $3 billion. The deal was the largest-ever acquisition by Apple, and brought Beats co-founders Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine to join Apple. The Apple earbuds, AirPods, were next, which paved the way for wireless headphones to become mainstream. Then Apple launched the Apple Watch in 2015, as an accessory to the iPhone which tracks various health and fitness metrics.

Apple has also built out its subscription services to include music and video streaming, video games, fitness and cloud storage. This segment alone generated $53 billion revenue in 2020, making it Apple’s second largest segment.

All eyes are on Apple’s next products, which may include a new virtual reality headset. The past few product launches have been smaller in scope, like the HomePod and AirPod. Yet, Apple fans are still somehow clamoring for the next iPhone, after almost two decades. 

*Note: Apple’s financial year ends in September.*

No. They are just losing the ability to carry a conversation with people outside of their generation. The same way every other generation before them had a different way of talking and communicating from the generation before them. 

>	In fact studies are starting to link excessive phone use with depression in teens, something I’ve been saying for years

I‘d like to see those. Normally studies link excessive consumption of **social media** with depression. The same way the heroine chic of earlier times was linked with eating disorders in teenage girls. The m
edium isn’t the problem but the content. 

>	It’s not high on my priority list as a parent to care.

It should be. Teenage years spent cut off from a huge part of their peer group are problematic, to say the least. 

Who gets bullied? Those that don’t fit in and thus present an easy target. When I was a teenager, wearing the wrong clothes made you an easy target. Now it’s the wrong type of phone. 

>	No where is a cell phone a life necessity at all.

The VR market is so small that I think Apple is more likely to expand the total addressable market than they are to take market share from Meta. More VR headset manufacturers leads to more VR developers who will probably develop for both platforms. Biggest problem right now is that there's really no compelling application to use VR, not that Meta's devices are limiting, maybe Apple developers can change that, who knows.

All separately, they are multibillion dollar businesses mostly all capable of generating billions in low cost profits.

I like Meta until $300. But I will need to see actual evidence of Ad turnaround to invest more. 

The problem here is that Zucc has vocally, as recently as two weeks ago, confirmed that he is not slowing investment into Reality Labs. I would like to emphasize that there is a false narrative that he somehow is canceling the Metaverse. They spent $20+ billion in the last 12 months in net loss on Reality Labs... 

Not to mention, they fired 28% of workers. Morale at Facebook is awful among employees. And further employee cuts will start hitting employees who are actually productive & useful. The easy gains are gone, the hard ones are what is left (boosting ad sales in recession).",t3_13ymfks,1685812242.0,2
