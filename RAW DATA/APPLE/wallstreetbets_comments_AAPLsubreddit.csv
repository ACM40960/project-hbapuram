\~40% of market volume is done via dark pools.  [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp#citation-17)  You can read more about dark pools more generally there.  They are not illegal, even though dark sounds scary, they are a normal part of daily market function.  Many times, its just pensions or buy side institutions looking to not disturb the markets.  

On this day..  AAPL had:

AAPL Off Exchange & Dark Pool Summary  
Today's Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume is 30,672,965, which is 46.93% of today's total volume.  
Today's Lit volume is 34,686,800, which is 53.07%.  
Over the past 30 days, the average Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume has been 42.84%.  
The average Lit volume has been 57.16%. [Source](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-aapl/exchange-volume/)

It was a slightly higher day in off exchange / dark pool volume, relative to the average daily volume.  This particular trade accounted for \~13% of daily volume.  Its large.  But it is not uncommon.  

TLDR  Take this with a grain of salt amongst all the other things you take into account when making a trade.  Or not, just smash the call button on your personal gambling device. 

....yes there are controversies surrounding off exchange trading on ""unlit"" markets.  I encourage you to educate yourself.  Find others that share your beliefs and organize.  Its not to hard to find the folks addressing these issues if thats what you are into.",t3_zcpv08,1670216121.0,641

I know a guy, not even all that rich and they have been going after him for 10+ years, FBI, ATF, IRS, etc. It culminated in a major raid in 2017. He finally got sentenced to 30 months. Because he please guilty after like 4 years of stalling. He was supposed to report 2 months ago, but is somehow still out. The belief is he will have to serve 4-6 months in Pensacola with a work release and then be on house arrest for the remainder. He's able to get time served credit for pre-trial and right now while his motions to the BOP are still pending and is on house arrest with work hours privilege. He's in the ""entertainment services"" business though so his work hours are pretty much all the time and all over the place. He does have to file a request for anytime he leaves his federal district though and it's like almost everyday he is traveling to a new city so pretty much never at home. 

And this is a guy that is by no means super rich, 5-10 million net worth before the FBI and IRS seized like half of his assets. There's no reasonable way to think they could actually prosecute someone like Elon, he could easily stall until he dies or moves to mars. 

The best part is the guy I know had to write a letter to the judge during his sentencing and it was like a 1 line apology and then multiple pages of him bragging about how good of a businessman he was and how successful his business are, which is only the case because his business model was pretty much just breaking laws and not paying any taxes.",t3_zcpv08,1670221287.0,16

Buy backs essentially remove the shares from the open market. How it works: Lets say there are 100 shares of a company, each worth $1, and you own 10 of them (so the company is worth $100). AKA you own 10% worth $10. If the company buys back 50 of them and removes them from the circulation, their market cap hasnt changed, so you now own 10 shares that are worth $2, aka your wealth just increased $10.

Why would apple do it? Its kind of a ""cheat"" to return value to shareholders in a ""free"" or reduced cost way. You could pay a dividend, but people have to pay taxes on those usually, and its counted as regular income vs. long term capital gains when you sell a stock. 

So apple is sitting on $50B or whatever it is these days, and the best way they think they can return value to their shareholders is to increase the value of their shares via a buyback, as opposed to spending on R&D, buying a new tech, or issuing a dividend, etc...",t3_zcpv08,1670226241.0,20

552,iz0vhfj,t1_iz0hyj9,"I agree with most of the great comments here. My two cents. It still boils down to money. If Intel can pay the talent that these big software companies are taking away from it, it will pretty easily be able to get to the latest TSMC node. There’s no magic technology that TSMC has, in fact everyone uses the same technology, it’s the process of making which needs refinement. The issue is that TSMC can afford to make it cheaply enough while getting the cream of the crop talent in Taiwan (assumption), but Intel can’t afford the cream of the crop coz it’s a hardware company, it has big overhead costs compared to all the software tech giants in US. This makes Intel only afford the second tier talent. TSMC is having trouble hiring people for their upcoming AZ plant coz they can’t afford to pay what Intel is paying in US, they are getting their Taiwan workforce exported here. At the end everything boils down to money ….

All of our allies would be right there with us if China did decide to go in and China doesn't want that. A war of that magnitude would ruin China. And as much as Russia and China seem to be buddies, I don't got Russia getting into that battle with China, against the west.

You're likely skeptical due to language differences. It's not an issue. You're usually exclusively speaking English inside these international firms. When engaging in daily life, almost everything is provided by the travel agency. You can reserve a translator from the company's portal, and that's what I did at first. However, it's usually way easier to pay an escort (prostitute) to refer you to a translator. It's way less oversight from the company, much easier to have spontaneous trips, and much cheaper than expected. With these large firms, they'll put you up in international hotels. Business cards and flyers for prostitutes are delivered under your hotel door.

It's both. 
  
> How would you define slavery?  
  
Well, if we're getting down to *definitions*, I'd say ""slavery"" is ""ownership of a person as property,"" but I understand we're not being that technical so I think using ""slavery"" to refer to ""involuntary servitude"", while not technically accurate, is fine.  
  
> I'd define it as requiring labor that you get little to no compensation for and where because of the situation you are dependent on your ""employer"" to provide the basic necessities of life and cannot gain any positive benefit for your fiture.  
  
I think your definition is actually a bit too *narrow*, actually. There's no upper threshold on income that turns slavery into non-slavery. If you're being forced to work for $1 a day, that's slavery. If you're being forced to work for $1,000 a day, that's *also* slavery. Also, it doesn't matter if you're dependent on your ""employer"" or if you buy your food in a grocery store. Also, it doesn't matter if you can save up money or if you can't gain any benefits for the future. Slave owners don't get those easy outs .   
  
A lot of what you describe are things that often go with slavery, but they're not the definition of slavery. That kind of narrow, inaccurate definition is what some rednecks use to wave away the history of the south -- ""My great-grandpappy wasn't a slave owner, he paid his workers well!"" Doesn't matter. If he owned them as property, they were slaves, no matter how well they were treated. Being nice to slaves doesn't get you off the hook for being a slave owner. It just makes you *less evil* of a slave owner than your colleagues.  
  
And, likewise, if you don't *own* people, but you force them to work for you, that's involuntary servitude, which is close enough to slavery that we can lump them together here. And paying them well and allowing them to save for the future and them being able to rely on others for their basic necessities doesn't mean they aren't *really* involuntary servants, it simply means they're involuntary servants who don't have it as bad as others.  
  
> Also if your options are die in poverty or ""accepting"" the dangerous and extremely grueling work conditions  
  
I think that's begging the question, though. And if the net is cast as widely as simply ""they have to work *somewhere* or they will die, so they're slaves"" then like 99% of the world are slaves. I'm a slave. You're probably a slave. It (and ""involuntary servitude"") become useless words at that point.  You could be alone, on a deserted island, by yourself, and be a ""slave"" with that kind of loose definition.   
  
> You can pretend that it's not slavery because you get to hide behind some bullshit wording  
  
It's not bullshit wording, it's what words mean. Lack of empathy would be saying ""their conditions are fine,"" or ""they shouldn't complain because they chose the job,"" or ""they should consider themselves lucky to have a job,"" or bullshit like that. Saying ""they are working under horrible, oppressive work conditions"" isn't blowing off the oppressiveness or horrible state of their working conditions.",t3_z3v93y,1669343310.0,26

1098,ixpnmkm,t1_ixpkpca,">why does China suppress all discussion of what happened on that day?

This is a topic that requires a lot of words.  For a theoretical framework, read Antonio Gramsci on Cultural Hegemony.  

The Chinese constitution guarantees free speech.  It does outlaw anti-revolutionary speech.  What this means is that pro-capitalist speech, or speech aimed at destabilizing the socialist project are banned.  This isn't fundamentally different from Germany banning pro-nazi speech.  

The truth is that the US has been trying to destabilize the PRC since before it even came to power.  They created Radio Free Asia as a propaganda outlet to create nonsensical stories to destabilize China and simultaneously drum up support in the western world for US aggression.  The US also created the VoCMF to produce propaganda against the communist world in general.  The US used to drop propaganda in pamphlets from airplanes over Chinese cities.

China needs to counter these threats.  Disallowing repeating western propaganda is one way of doing that.  Tiananmen was a tragedy, but it wasn't a broad massacre of thousands.  A few hundred died, the first of which were Chinese soldiers, the bulk of which were from a violent labor protest taking place elsewhere in Beijing, some of them were students and troublemakers that had stolen weapons out of the PLA vans that they commandeered.  By the way, all of that, except the bit about the labor protest is in the GoHP documentary produced by the US govt and the Ford Foundation, which is broadly considered to be an academic source on the matter in the west.  It broadly contradicts much of the modern narrative and, when it was produced was heavily slanted against the Chinese in favor of a more horrendous narrative.

>Why is it not seen as a victory for the Socialist revolution?

Why would socialists celebrate the death of working people?  You must *really* not understand the socialist position.

>Why are the soldiers who died but revered as martyrs?

They aren't to my knowledge.

>prior ""counter-revolutionary"" purges?

You color these purges in such a one-sided light.

Wasn't the French revolution, which is ubiquitously seen as the death knell of feudalism and the ushering in of capitalism...why do you not see that as a purge?  The people living like leeches on the backs of the common people that had the audacity to continue supporting the feudal system were seen as incompatible with the direction society needed to go. 

The purges of the Kulaks in the USSR were the result of rich landowners who essentially owned slaves as serfs (even though it was illegalized a generation earlier, it functionally continued even into the early USSR) were told that their lands were now held in common by their workers.  They responded by burning their crops, refusing to plant more crops, leaving crops to rot in their fields and slaughtering nearly half of the total livestock in the whole of the USSR, all of which were major factors in the Soviet famine of the 30s.  Purging them shouldn't be viewed by anyone any differently than the French revolution: an ugly, but ultimately necessary line.  The lords in France caused the abject misery of millions.  The kulaks caused or seriously contributed to the deaths of millions through Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the whole of the USSR.  Should they have been left to do as they pleased? 

>Why, if so many died defending the revolution and so few died opposing it, was the demonstration so effectively put down on that day?

For one, the govt had done nothing for many weeks.  At a certain point, once the order is given to the army to clear the square, they did.  What is hard to imagine about that?  Do nothing.  Now go make them leave.  It's like wondering why your car doesn't drive until after you turn it on.

>Also, if the demonstrations were known to be pushed by the US,

This is undeniable.  They might not have started there, but they were certainly guided and funded by the US.

>why did the US and China continue to engage in friendly relations in the time leading up to it?

You know the US was still selling oil to the Nazis during WW2, right?

FWIW, at the time, China was heavily criticizing the US and NATO for bombing Belgrade.  China and the US had a mutually beneficial relationship at the time.

>The article you linked doesn't even pass the ""Think about it for five minutes"" test.

It does actually.  Unless somehow you think it's more plausible that the Chinese govt executed 10,000 people in one day, with their families numbering 5-10 people for every one person killed, somehow that 50-100k people just forgot.  Are just cowering in fear... Bla bla bla.  

What is more likely: the US is the largest propaganda producer in the world, or China is?  And what about in 1992?  The idea that China is capable of controlling the minds of 1.4 billion people, some 560 million (130M more people than the entire US) of which live rurally, but that the US, with the combination of state, corporation, shareholders, the wealthiest country to ever exist, the NSA, CIA, FBI, and all the other known instances of creating propaganda is to be believed uncritically is beyond the fucking pale.

In 2008, he basically lost our house. I was 15 at the time. My mother was hella mad at him. After the foreclosure, we relocated somewhere else. He continued making awful financial decisions. A decade later, he had 250000$ of debts and sadly passed away due to cancer.

It seems if the product works as advertised they are leading in AR as a replacement to devices. They are making a Tesla roadster entry to the market and I find it impressive and demonstrating they have actual IP and innovation here (if working as advertised).

It cost my dad like over $3k at Best Buy back then. I remember thinking computers were so expensive. 

Obviously over the years computers have gotten more affordable and powerful. Heck you can go to wal mart now and by a new PC for like $200 bucks.

It comes down to are you going to use apps on it or just like a web browser. I was hoping for an ar headset as a like accessory to iPhone.

2280,jn4damt,t1_jn48zqh,"I think AR is the way forward without question.  
  
If you look at what Microsoft is doing with it's hololens (check out the videos) that's the way forward.  
 
Which will change the world and it's inevitable now.  
 
I think the whole metaverse, VR is a failed idea, but AR, professionally? Imagine throwing on your headset and that's ""work"", you can interact with coworkers just as you do in the office and collaborate, but you don't need to sit in traffic and drive all the way to an office.  
 
Like the big downside to work from home is it impedes a lot of things, it impedes collaborative workflows, teamwork, etc.. you have to deal with zoom and noises in the background blah blah blah.  
 
Ar fixes that, you don't need to live in a big city, so you don't need to pay big city property and income tax, you can scout the brst talent from across the world as long as they have good internet, you have avatars replace people so you don't need to deal with pantless Paul (or you can be pantless Paul).   
 
It's best of both worlds, but more importantly, it's the most efficient way forward. It reduces corporate expenses because they don't need big office structures to pay for, it reduces costs to employees since they don't need to commute, so they don't need to buy expensive houses, etc etc etc.  
 
I don't think it happens soon, but at this point it's pretty much inevitable that it will go this way.  Municipal governments in some of these shitty cities that have been living it up fleecing their subjects for every dime they have while grossly mismanaging the budget are going to have a tough time in the future imo.",t3_142b64n,1686060299.0,-3

2449,jn5y09t,t1_jn5w3dc,"The lack of quality VR games is why VR hasn't sold, as the price point is too high for many compared to what they will receive for it. Once you've played through Half like Alyx or idk, VR version of No Man's Sky, what is left for someone besides Wii clones in 3d? Not much. That kills the idea of VR headsets in gaming, as the lack of games makes it unviable to the average consumer.

AR headsets are technically different, but they don't offer much in the way of need. They are novelty items that in the end are no different than VR in that they are toys. They don't fill a need, don't replace any former item that was necessary for daily life, and don't really offer anything besides that novelty ""cool"" factor that quickly wears off. 

This is all my personal opinion obviously, but when I see people compare this to the iPhone, I can't help but think many weren't around during those days.  Smartphones didn't take over from Blackberry and flip phones in market share until the barrier of entry was cheap enough and the market saturated enough to be worth it to the average person. iPhone was the first, but it also fed off of the iTunes thing back in the day, as it could be considered a mobile mp3 player like iPods that could also call people. iPhones replaced a need (phones) while also replacing a former top product (iPods) and combining them. The price became justified, because people need phones and they loved mp3 players. 

As for AR headsets, what's the need? What does it replace? What niche does it really fill? If I'm in the market for an AR/VR headset, why would I not go with Valve Index that could do multiple things for half the price, instead of an Apple Vision Pro?",t3_142b64n,1686082540.0,2

That dual-use justified the price for many. 

What's the dual-use for this AR headset? What does this replace that is a necessary consumer item like iPhones did? I'd say the MacBooks are in the same category, as they replace personal computers, something nearly everyone needs to function in modern society.

Apple may market themselves as high-end, but in reality their main market is the average person. The status symbol of Apple products is just a side thing, not one that really matters.

Let me put it this way I guess: Everyone on earth needs a phone. You can't get a job without a phone. You can't do most things in life without a phone. iPhones provide a need, even if they are expensive. iPhone 1s provided that need (replaced Blackberry or flip phones) while also essentially being iPods as well, so they provided a bigger incentive to spend the extra $ for one. Macbooks, well, they are PCs. Almost everyone needs a PC for daily life just as much as they need phones. Staying in the Apple ecosystem is comforting for many who own iPhones, so there's incentive to buy Macbooks.

What does the Apple Vision Pro provide that is a need? Where's the ecosystem link? What does it replace?

2496,jji1kz6,t3_13cndqs,"Remember they were competitors. The Atari home computer (400 and 800) were their game console with a keyboard added.  Atari was the first to sell their computer in a retail chain - Sears. Sears, not knowing what the thing was, sold it in its home appliance department along with the Kenmore vacuum cleaners, blenders, Little Mac hamburger cookers, and ironing boards.  The sales people had no training and not a clue how it worked. They could not demo them.  So they sat there with lovely cardboard signage turned off.

Bushnell would have been dumb to support a competitor. Atari was bought by Waner Communications in 1976. They sold it to Jack Tramiel of Commodore fame in 1984. 

People look at personal computers as something that has always been around and has clear value. Not so at all. In the beginning you could not give them away. No one had a clue why you would want one. Hell the handheld calculator had just come out and people struggled adopting it.  The learning curve was steep; the software buggy.  The memory was so small you couldn't do much.  Then came the Visicalc spreadsheet. The first ""killer app"".  It allowed middle management to do REAL work every day and being middle management could sign off on the expense - which was SUBSTANTIAL for a real computer, keyboard, printer, terminal (or monitor) and floppy disk drives.",t3_13cndqs,1683656352.0,3

In 2016, Brevik revealed that he was once approached by Sabeer Bhatia in 1996 to form an email company in which he will get 10% of the shares. Brevik flatly rejected the offer, thinking it was the ""stupidest idea."" 14 months later, when the company, later known as Hotmail, sold for $400 million, Brevik expressed his regret over that decision, calling it the ""worst business decision of my entire career.""

If you make it a point to have a subset of your administrative duties being to seek out and acquire all possible competitors when they are just barely stretching their legs it's a lot easier to present a deal that is too much for budding entrepreneurs to refuse--because at that point they themselves don't know if they're going to succeed. In an ideal world, these acquisitions mean that newer innovative practices and innovations get folded into the product, but in actuality unless this process can present a significant case for increased revenue proportional to the required investment, they just get binned...

3447,j20fcv4,t3_zx47dj,"The Government printed trillions of dollars which FK people over with Inflation.

And then, the government fights inflation by raising interest rate which FK people over some more.   It's double fking.   (while still continue to print trillions).

And people wonder why there are homeless and looting everywhere.   Our corrupt government is turning the US into a third word country, but people are too busy fighting each other over nonsense.   It's by design, the elites are creating a culture that fosters weak passive porn/video game addict men, who are too weak to rise up against tyranny.  You all know the saying,  ""good time create weak men, and weak men create hard time....""  

Think about it for a second.  We are more technologically advance than a hundred years ago.   We have machines and robotic that can mass produce anything.  We have computer, AI, and software for everything.  The internet alone revolutionizes eCommerce.   Productivity has never been higher.   

The law of economy says that if you are more efficient at producing stuff, it becomes more affordable/cheaper.   And yet, our standard of living continue to decline years after years.   Poverty and homelessness keep rising.  People can't afford kids or houses; we have record number of young people still living at home.   Every stop and wonder why? doesn't seem to make sense. 

It's because the government NEVER stop printing money.   Wake up people.   They print monopoly money out of nowhere to line up their pockets and buy up real world assets. Any increase in productivity is completely offset by inflation.   A dollar today is only worth 10cents a hundred years ago.  

Here is their game plan:  

1. Print monopoly money
2. Buy up real world assets with said money
3. repeat step 1&2 until hyperinflation kick in.   Money become worthless, BUT they keep the real word assets. 
4. say ""oop, sorry guys, your life saving is worthless now, but here is a new currency""
5. repeat step 1.  

And as the cycle keep repeating, the elites are buying up more and more assets , while the people get poorer and poorer.   And that is how you get a two class system, the have and the have not.",t3_zx47dj,1672255649.0,0

This headset is absolutely insane if the specs that are being written in the news articles are correct. It has a 4K screen per Eye at least. It is Micro-OLED which is the pinnacle of display technology especially important in VR headsets. It reaches up to 5000 nits and has 4000 Pixels per Inch (PPI). These specs are absolutely groundbreaking to say the least. This headset is at least 5 years ahead of its competition.

The Humane Ted Talk is when I went all in on Apple. Ironically, not all in on Humane. 

Chaudri gave a great demo, and it convinced me that Apple will be the ones to do it. Like all things Apple, they won't be the first or have the most features, and it will be overpriced, but they'll be the ones who make the thing real people actually adopt.

They'll steal it all from Humane or something, sure, but it will be the Apple version that wins.

That's my bet anyway. 

Remind me in 5 years. We'll see if I went wrong by buying Apple stock right before the next biggest revolution in personal computing.

I don't think many people have said that, but there's always a first. 

Wow, I really messed up buying apple stock right before GUIs took over. Wow, I really messed up buying Apple stock before laptops outpaced desktops. Wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before personal mp3 players took off. Wow, I really messed up buyiny Apple stock right before smart phones took off. 

Lol

Now I'm supposed to think some day I'll say ""wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before AI/VR/AR converged""

That's a calculated risk I'm willing to take.",t3_141o118,1685997819.0,15

3552,jn0vx06,t3_141o118,"Lmao people who bash VR (note not AR) as a bad investment are so short sighted. As someone using it everyday it’s like reading comments about the internet in 1992 where the news segments are laughing at notion the infant WWW would result in anything significant. 

If you know someone with a meta quest go ask to play thrill of the fight (a $10 game) and experience getting your fucking ass kicked in a single 3 round fight in less than 10 minutes. You will be dripping with sweat throwing haymakers in an immersive simulated boxing match, and the best part is it’s insanely FUN. I’ve lost 20 pounds literally because of a video game lmao, with 0 changes to my diet. 

Every person I have shown my VR headset two are amazed by it. Once the triple AAA companies start making games it will the future vr will play a major role in video games. It’s is the ultimate immersive 
 experience for games. 

And video games are only a fraction of the potential revenue streams. In the next 10 years the NFL and NBA will be selling monthly subscription options to watch games in VR from a court side seats perspective. The nfl I promise you, will put cameras on qb helmets to give you in the moment feel of a game from the qbs perspective. VR has so many potential options for revenue, sports and video games are just the obvious start.

TLDR you are being a dumb dumb if you think VR is a fad. It’s new, it’s not perfect, but holy shit go use one and you will understand. It’s like the first time you used an iPhone and got that “yeah… this is the future” feeling. I promise you, two of the 7 biggest companies in the world are not investing billions in the space without the due diligence, and more importantly foresight, to see where VR is 5 to 10 years from now. It has the potential to be their flagship product.",t3_141o118,1685991730.0,67

Based on them calling it “visual computing” (or whatever the term was) as well as the examples shown in the keynote, I’d guess they’re looking to have this be the next evolution of the laptop. Instead of working on a small monitor, now you can have more than a desktop’s worth of high res screens on a device that fits in a backpack. Perfect for digital nomads or people who travel for business and work out of hotels often. Works well for business calls (both because of the ease of seeing and hearing everyone while leaving yourself hands free as well as the ability to share things easily with the others on the call). Let’s you watch movies and TV shows on a big screen even in a hotel or on a plane. Comes with day 1 support for a selection of professional tools.

How often do you actually use it? Not for a party trick, not to show someone how cool the tech is, how often do you, by yourself, strap yourself in? How often for productivity and how often for entertainment?

I ask because I barely use mine anymore.

Pretty much every VR game takes a lot of energy to play except for the few that you can sit to play.

It also needs a lot of space. Where my setup is I keep hitting the wall and I am always afraid of hitting my monitor. You really need a big room with nothing to trip over or to hit.

So VR gaming is not something that you are going to want to do for hours on end.

Other than that I don't see a lot of use for a VR headset. There are niche things like VR chat or exploring places in VR but it isn't something that you will be using all the time for everything.

I'm the opposite of an early adopter, I like tech that is matured and capable, and I bought the PSVR2 recently because it's the first one that fit all my requirements for a VR headset. But I would've never bought it at this price.

I think what Apple is trying to do is to be standard Apple, make it a luxury item that people envy in order to drive a perception of premium experience, and then ramp the price down later under competition and the like.

This works for laptops and computers at this price, because it's only paying a premium on what people expect to pay.

With VR headsets we instead have a new category. Apple wants it to take off and establish a baseline price point as well. But I think they've aimed too high.

4069,jn726ai,t1_jn4yvgz,"So, you mean they should sell the hardware cheaper and reach the break-even point of the product with their software?

That’s basically the opposite, how Apple usually operates. Apple was always selling their hardware at a much higher price than the software their products comes with. That’s their strategy. And they are very successful with it, even thought that everybody says „BuT tHe PaRtS cOsT oNly 100$“. Most people underestimate the costs of good software development and smooth integration into the Apple ecoworld. Therefore they are not willing to pay money for it. Thats the reason, why Apple „hides“ these costs behind the high selling prices of the hardware. They know, that nobody would pay 100$ for their Mail Client, Apple Maps, Safari, MacOS or whatever (think of it, how many consumer PCs have valid ~100$ Windows license, except the OEM licenses or upgrades from old versions?). But if the consumer get’s some material in their hands, they are more likely to pay for it.

Apple doesn’t have the need for mass users to get developers to develop things for their hardware. Apple already has the developers and they are paid by the price of the product. Especially because they don’t need new apps, the available apps from MacOS/iOS are said to be compatible with VisionPro.",t3_141o118,1686099387.0,2

Also Cohen isn't some savior. Chewy had a nice hype run in early 2021 under Cohen (which ultimately evaporated like everything he touches), but the work culture he created there is pretty terrible. They are heavily discouraged from taking any vacation. My sister in law quit her corporate position after being fed up with it.

4457,ijexh3m,t1_ijex093,"This is what he told me Saturday morning, he told me he’s just going to copy a comment he made else where. Which pretty much turned into this post. 

“going to copy/paste A reply that I gave someone else - 

I Chose the strike prices because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, & the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight. Exercised because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously but, I believe the stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….

Thesis - I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, has been running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only company that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

After the E a r nings disaster, the stock was pummeled from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks.  So initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal. However, After the E R meltdown and -50% day the CEO stepped down, and the stock was pounded down into the 4s.

Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 11% of the company in march) was again performing a hostile takeover, and forced the CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board.

I am pretty much fully invested in Ryan Cohen, so this caught my attention, and it was immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market. Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15. In addition he holds millions of dollars worth of $60 and $80 strike call options expiring January 23.

As GME went through it’s split disaster, I tracked the stock and waited for a bottom, as I had supreme confidence that a serious turnaround was just on the horizon. But it does not take genius to see the value, and spot a nice reversal play when a stock goes from $30 in March to five dollars in June - even without the Ryan Cohen‘s factor.

Again, It was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks , So again they move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops. This was leading up to the Gme split, so I anticipated a solid appreciation from $BBBY’s lowest point in almost 3 decades.

I waited patiently, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, except I only had about $1000 and play….

As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.

Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.

After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I am super burnt out and my brain is fried. My apologies)….

Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.

So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.

Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

Thursday it closed at 6.12, and if it were to be able to close above 6.50, The entire float would be in the money via derivatives. That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.

So yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.

Hope this helps!

Again, he has 60 and $80 call options expiring January 23. He also holds the grenade that would act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme. And again, at the very least, his price basis is $15.

I have yet to sleep, and my brain hurts so I’m gonna stop typing now lol. If you have any other questions I’d be more than happy to answer them, but I’m going to take a break from Reddit for a while and get some rest and try to process what just happened. It still doesn’t even feel real! Yowzers.

Hopefully this comment gets pinned, so that not only can it serve to answer The dozens of other people who have asked me this question, but also as A rough, brain dead Version of a thesis for why I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022. I wouldn’t go so far as saying GameStop2.0, but if there was ever anything even remotely close, this is certainly it. Much love y’all!”

But he was super nice and cool and told me a bunch of other shit including the calls and shared a lot of his cool art work",t3_wizna5,1659943942.0,26

During 2020 I just ordered 3 meals from the Martha Stewart meal service ($10 a person) and 3-4 from dinnerly ($5 a person) so we had 3 nice meals a week and 4 basic and would grocery shop 1x a month

Maybe you forgot, but TSLA promised 50% YoY growth for several years. And now you want to ""bet"" that Q3 numbers are higher than Q1 numbers.

You're forgetting that there's a 6 month gap. 50% YoY growth equals 22% growth every six months.

Q3 needs to be 22% higher than Q1 for Tesla to stay on target. Not just 1 car higher.

Q1 was 310k cars. Q3 needs to be 378k cars.

The analyst consensus is 358k. Troy Teslike (a dumb bull) puts it at 366k.

Volkswagen made 8 million cars last year. Market cap = $81.45 billion

Tesla makes less than 2 million cars per year. Market cap = **$895 billion**

Especially these days where there’s exponentially more options trading than ever before, and most block trades never see the light of day on a lit exchange. You can be sure that if there is some institutional selling it probably won’t be AAPL, and if for some unbeknownst reason it is, it’ll be an arbitrage opportunity in a dark pool somewhere and it’ll hit the tape outside of retail hours.

Of the top three largest builders in the U.S. LEN is the only one thats not >5% down since weds. Literally any other housing puts would have printed but I chose the fucking stinker. They even had earnings this week and gave TERRIBLE projections and forward guidance. Only downside movement of any significance was pre/AH trading with immediate bounce to green at open so I never had a chance to cash in my puts when they were up for all of a minute or two at open. 

My other trade was TSLA 289 puts I sold thursday before close for 100% gain. If I held overnight they were worth almost 2k each by open. Fucking GAWD. I was so pissed from bleeding out my ass on the LEN puts I panic sold them to try and secure a little profit to offset a tiny bit of loss and I missed the big one.

First, today's rotation seemed out of defensive stocks and into risk assets like tech. But the risk assets are the ones that were really dependent on free money, often not profitable, much more expensive for a unit of earnings, etc. Since interest rates are still rising (even if you think the next rate hike will be only half a point) then these are exactly the companies that will probably be hurt by the continuation of rates in the current range. If you expect the market to dump in the medium term and interest rates to remain mostly where they are with a smaller hike, seeing a spike back in risk assets feels like it's only happening to flush out the shorts, trick new longs into entering, and whipsaw everyone back and forth. 

Now, while any move back into risk assets will necessarily be bearish on the defensives, I also have a theory here. If you believe the defensives are the ones you should own during a coming recession, inflation, etc, then them being taken down a peg could be setting up the slope for the next leg down for all equities, but masking it as a shift back into risk assets.",t3_yrlx6d,1668128331.0,3

There are tons of things robots could do. I remember a few years back when people were talking about and freaking out over replacing fast food workers with automation. I remember thinking, I work construction, a robot could never do this stuff. 

Then I saw a rudimentary robot hang & screw in sheetrock. It was just programmed too, it didn't utilize machine learning. With enough training, you could get a robot that walks into a room. Uses its sensors to measure the room. Compute every size sheet it needs, cuts, and hang them. No breaks needed, no guys calling out because they are hungover & screwing up the schedule, and they can work 24/7 when they arent charging.

You can train a them to do so many things. You could upload the blueprints for a new house. They could excavate, pour the foundation, frame the house, set windows, run electrical/plumbing/hvac, sheetrock, trim, etc. There will still need to be some quality control & inspections, but that could be a crew of just a couple people. The labor involved to build a house where i work includes ~20 different trade companies, who employ probably at least 10 employees each or more.

9250,igj3q9r,t1_igj0h22,"Not exclusive to Stellantis, just agree it is a reasonable long play. Owned their predecessor FCA when they spun out Ferrari ($RACE). 

I am currently long Ford, long VW ($VOW3) long Porsche ($PAH). Burry was a VW bull in CoVid, seems he’s out now. Porsche historically gets a bit of a cheaper stake in VW vs owning VW directly.

My underlying thesis is that the newly IPO’ed EV companies come in with new tech and want to learn how to scale factories and infrastructure, whereas the old guard wants to leverage their existing manufacturing know-how and facilities to make EVs. My impression is that the latter is less likely to go bankrupt.

Stellantis over Ford is Ford’s pension liability headwind, since F refused bankruptcy like Chrysler in 2008-9. That said, I think F150 Lightning is going to be in some driveways, and reusing the body parts from the gas F150 is an economy of scale that is tough to match.

For VW, their plot armor is their ownership stake from Germany governments, Germany controls Euro economy to torpedo Euro exchange value, to keep manufacturing voters happy, and VW cars cheap abroad. That said VW will have to continue to shift more of their manufacturing of US trucks/vans to US shores to beat the ‘chicken-tax’ headwind. I think the ID.buzz microbus will be a global hit, driving economy of scale.

Going long in auto manufacturing in a recession is not for weak of heart—it needs a long term view. But there can be value to be had as long as the company won’t go bankrupt.",t3_w19awy,1658073590.0,19

There are likely higher yielding companies to have in a portfolio. Burry constrained to only choose among those that have enough liquidity to open/close.

9358,j1i4cye,t3_ztwv2w,"I also laughed/cringed when I first heard that grinder $GRND went public.  However, upon doing some research, it does seem like something potentially brewing in this ticker:

1). HUGE insider buys by Raymond Zage (hetero guy who took it public) after it dropped below $6
2). Incredibly small public float for quite a while 
3). Been eerily quiet in terms of PR and near zero chatter on stock interwebs, perhaps planning something 
4). Company is actually profitable and somewhat undervalued 
5). Average users spend nearly one hour per day on the app
5). The LGBTQ factor - are “THEY” going to let the first gay stock fail?

Just to level set some of the apes, it looks like you were in it for almost $49k to net $25k. Your screenshot doesn't appear to be your executed close figures. That's understandable, and that's why my math is approximate based on the screenshot.

600 contracts \* 100 shares per contract \* $0.81 average cost = $48,600 buy in.$76,800 market value - $48,600 buy in = $28,200 net profit! (before broker fees on both sides if any)

10000,jm72aqi,t1_jm4pmm4,"Yeah with the language stuff it’s literally just finding the answer on the Internet and rephrasing it for you. That’s cool, and it can probably replace a first line customer service chat, but it’s not going to be something you can trust for high level or specialized work if any kind. 

I’m an accountant, and let me tell you, when you actually get into the weeds of tax law, it can actually be hard to find the answer on the Internet. Especially state laws or more recent changes. You actually have to go find the law and translate the legalese. Maybe a chat bot can do that, but I don’t think in the current state they can do that well, or in a reliable enough way that you’d want to just take the answer and file taxes with it. I certainly wouldn’t want it to write a letter to the IRS on my behalf lol. 

I think a typical problem you see with this kind of ai is that it’s taking information from the internet that can be years old, but then there’s a lot of it, so it gets very confident that it’s correct. That’s a big problem because of high level work has do with what is happening right now, and what’s going to happen in the next few years, and chat bots can’t really do that.",t3_13v08nu,1685451095.0,2

By your logic, the “leading developer” of washing machines would also be a tech company. 

Tesla’s EV drive train has nothing that other EVs don’t have. Nothing special about the motors, nothing special about the batteries. In fact, for the longest time and to this date, they have been using mostly run-off-the-mill standard cells from Panasonic, LG and CATL. 

Porsche, on the other hand, has pioneered the 800-Volt-battery system, which charges significantly faster than Tesla’s 400-Volt-system (an architecture that dates back to the Prius). The Taycan charges at a rate of 717 km range per charging hour, the Model S at 550. 

Tesla also doesn’t have the “most advanced autonomous driving software system”. Mercedes does. Mercedes now has level 3 autonomy on select models while Tesla is still stuck on level 2. 

Tesla is good at hype marketing. And Tesla has opened the consumer’s eyes to EVs, I grant them that. But that doesn’t make them a tech company. Nor does a whopping big display on the dashboard. 

Traditional car makers are already starting to run circles around Tesla with their own EVs, and it will only get worse. Tesla was a first mover, but doesn’t have the scale and horsepower to stay on top in the long run.",t3_ydhmik,1666781462.0,1

On our video editing test, which involves transcoding a 4K video to 1080p in the Adobe Premiere Rush app, the iPhone 14 Pro Max averaged 30 seconds. The Galaxy S22 Ultra needed 47 seconds.""

iPhones also tend to have the best battery lifetime on the market for comparably powerful devices. Idk if they have super duper low power modes like some Androids though.",t3_z7ytgm,1669804377.0,1

I would watch in the short term if it hits 153 your puts are not in line with the trend, 136 and your still on line for some nice tendies. That strike date is too short tbh and I will say theta may eat your ass, but I like weeklys so I know your risk profile.  I'm starting to see a trend where people are right but the timeline doesn't allow for the full maximization of pulling tendies.  God speed and have a nice mid life crisis explaining to the wife you yoloed 100k on some chinese foxxconn employees not trying to kill themselves and protesting instead, oh and what if china opens up like the mkt is pricing in?

The reason $AAPL is going up is the Fed. Tech assets have duration risk with inflation (future cash flows get discounted if rates move up). If we are starting to see rates drop in the future (Powell signaled this) then tech will likely get some tailwind behind it. You are also running up against seasonality here.

11440,iyl4cug,t1_iyj5h0l,"Puts and calls are basically stock price insurance.  Puts are most appropriately purchased by people who own a significant amount of a certain stock.  Buying 1 put contract allows you to sell 100 shares of that stock for the agreed-upon ""strike"" price, until a certain expiration date.  Just as a year of car insurance costs more than a month of car insurance, puts with later expiration dates cost more than puts that expire soon.  Because the counterparty who sold the puts faces more risk over that longer time period.

If the value of your stock goes down below the strike price, you can exercise the put option and sell your stock at the strike price.  This can save you a lot of money.  However, it costs you money upfront.

If the value of the stock stays above the strike price until the expiration date, then the put expires worthless.

In the case of buying a put when you don't actually own the stock, that's called a ""naked"" put.  If the stock price drops below the strike price, the holder of the naked put can't sell any stock at the strike price, because he doesn't own it.  However, the put option is transferrable, so he can sell it to someone else, which will allow that person to sell their shares at the strike price.  (He could try to buy the stock and then sell it, but that's needlessly complicated.)

Buying naked puts is like buying car insurance on someone else's car.  It's generally a pointless waste of money, unless you expect that person to drive into a tree soon.",t3_z9rt36,1669956506.0,3

Call options and put options are the best way to become rich fast on the stock market as opposed to just regular individual stocks. 1 contract contains 100 shares of the stock at a fraction of the price. So since you own 1 contract with 100 shares in it and the stock goes up 1 cent you made 100 cents as opposed to just 1 cent if you owned only 1 stock. Now times that times 10x if you own 10 contracts thats 1000 cents earned off 1cent increase in the stock, or 1000 cent loss if it goes the other way so you can lose money easier too. Op has +300 contracts so therefore thats 300 x the %gain or loss ammount.",t3_z9rt36,1669956137.0,2

The price of the contract will go up as the stock approaches his “Strike Price” which is $145.  At any point during the markets open hours of 9:30-4:00, he can sell his options contracts which he paid $3.13 each for. If apple goes down at all, the price of each contract will go up.  They would go up quickly past $3.13 per contract and he could then sell the same options contracts for a profit if they are more than $3.13.  In theory he could exercise the contracts if the price of apple goes “in the money” below $145 but that is rarely done and he would have to have the money to buy 300,000 shares of apple.

At one point, they were valued as much as Google, fb, and Amazon combined, and financials aren’t everything even in a high interest rate environment. Moats matter a lot in tech, and Apple relies too much on new phones. Eventually phones will have very long upgrade cycles, and pure tech scales a lot better because it’s all software, costs nothing to make again, and generally reused. I also think Apple will lose the 30% from the AppStore eventually since it’s anticompetitive. It’s like windows taking a cut of any software. macOS might be a good moat, but it’s barely better than Ubuntu. A lot of devs prefer Ubuntu, but business apps like outlook and slack have always been a bit shaky, but that’s changing too. I work in tech so it’s more of a feel, but i also don’t think Apple has strong, useful data compared to the other major tech companies. Data collection is also a form of a moat and is the main reason why Google search is so hard to replicate.

11568,izbqqda,t1_izbophf,"""... we need to raise interest rates to a level that is sufficiently restrictive to return 
inflation to 2%. There’s considerable uncertainty about what rate will be sufficient, although there’s no 
doubt that we’ve made substantial progress, raising our target range for the federal funds rate by 375 
basis points since March. As our last post-meeting statement indicates, we anticipate that ongoing 
increases will be appropriate. It seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be 
somewhat higher than thought at the time of the September meeting in the summary of economic 
projections""

""After our November meeting, we noted that we anticipated that ongoing rate increases 
will be appropriate in order to attain a policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to move inflation 
down to 2% over time. Monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with uncertain lags, and the 
full effects of a rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of 
our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. 
The time for moderating the pace of rate increases **may** come as soon as the December meeting. 
Given our price, our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant 
than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of 
time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level. It is likely that restoring price stability will 
require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against 
prematurely loosening policy. And I'll close by saying that we will stay the course until the job is done.

""So when will inflation come down? I could answer this question by pointing to the inflation forecasts of private 
forecasters or of FOMC participants, which broadly show a significant decline over the next year. But 
forecasts, forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year, while inflation has 
moved stubbornly sideways. The truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertainty""

""These are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As 
figure one makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases""

But just because a company is great with a great product doesn't mean you pay any price to own it. I don't see Snowflake outperforming QQQ the next 10 years.

As for acquisitions, Snowflake has a market cap of 56B. Very few companies have the ability to acquire a company of that size or even the need to (only MSFT, AMZN, GOOG come to mind). Google already has BigQuery. Amazon has RedShift. I don't want to argue the individual merits of those services vs Snowflake here since there are differences in features. But I think this is relatively low hanging fruit for any of these big guys to recreate a competing service with the same features in their cloud platform. Regardless, if one of them were going to acquire Snowflake they'd have to do it soon if you think it's going to keep getting bigger.

This will ensure that even though money is being pumped in, inflation will not increase drastically as the populace will have less money to spend on other stuff.

It's not unique to Chinese. It's unique to centrally planned economies. As annoying, irritating, slow and corrupt as democracy is, it has the benefit of many built-in status quo mechanisms (checks and balances, power shared at many levels). This means the bureaucracy moves at a glacial pace, *intentionally*. **It keeps our crooks from doing too much damage.**

That's why Trump's cult and his little 4 year temper tantrum was so dangerous. He was ignoring the bureaucracy and had enough loyalists installed there wasn't the typical resistance. More dangerous even than FDR, who extended the depression, commanded his own cult and did a shitload of damage (albeit well meaning) over 3 terms.

And, since it's the World's Factory, if they go tits up, a whole lot of other countries are gonna follow suit.

Also, I've been reading ""China is gonna invade Taiwan"" every year since 1998 and it's not happened yet.

In 2001 this dude wrote a book called ""The Coming Collapse Of China"", in which he said China would collapse by 2011. In 2011, when China hadn't collapsed, he said he was right but was only off by a year and that he should have said 2012. Here we are, another decade later and still no collapse.

you're a fucking retard that did no research. Taiwan controls 100% of all high end chip market. You heard me, 100%, ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.  No other company OR country in the world comes close. If China takes over Taiwan and cuts off the US, then it will knock back the US about 10-20 years in the tech tree. 

Also, did you even look at the terrain? Majority of the coast bordering china is mountainous regions. The only way you can conquer Taiwan is an amphibious assault at two beaches which serve as a choke point. Incidentily, that's where Taiwan has concentrated all of their forces. If China fails to take over Taiwan immediately, Taiwan will immediatly cut off chip supplies to China which will cripple their tech industry and will force every company to leave to have their gadgets be made elsewhere. Vietnam is already cheaper for labor than China. ANd if China does capture Taiwan, China have no way to protect the chip fabs without Taiwan going scorched earth and destroying them all.

Edit: there's shit tons of videos explaining why China wants Taiwan and why Taiwan is so important in the world.

Mostly because China’s biggest military ally/former enemy, Russia, is in a protracted war of its own, incapable of offering China any real useful support if things really go tits up…

Moreover, China is likely watching both the effectiveness of nato weapons, as well as the impacts of sever sanctions, and thinking,.. why do I need that in my life? 

Taiwan has previously been a topic of intrigue insofar as China has a stated policy of reuniting with the island … eventually… ambiguous… and the United States had maintained, up until recently, a policy of “strategic ambiguity” with respect to its intentions vis a vis Chinese invasion of Taiwan and as to topics of Chinese ownership/territorial rights to Taiwan (arguably, the WH walked back some of Biden’s comments)… the point is, it’s long been mired in a fog of bs, that suited everyone and that was the status quo… I’d argue that persists for awhile longer.

The real issue with China, imo, is what seems to be a confluence of both demographic issues (iirc, they recently corrected their census to reduce their population by 100m), long coming, and just a general malaise in their economic growth, perhaps due to Covid lockdowns, combined with their real estate issue, and or other domestic concerns.

In any event, for the above reasons, I don’t see war as a likelihood anytime soon. As you referenced, the Chinese economy is fairly integrated with the west such that it would be a painful endeavor for them to break off all relations, as it would be for the USA, but China doesn’t need that sort of headache and additional strain at this time. 

They seem plenty comfortable to exist in the current state of affairs because their leadership needs to maintain a grip on power, which is not made easier by economic strife.

It’s seems like you’re making a false equivalence between all governments because you’ve decided that any perspective that even attempts to differentiate between governments of different cultures must be racist.

Western governments can be bad and worthy of criticism AND the Chinese government can still be worse.

Housing markets like others have up and downs. By your logic of “no room to grow” just because there is a downturn, does that mean the US housing market never grew from 1929?

The only real issue you pointed out was there demographic situation, which is relatively offset by the fact that around 40% of Chinese still live in rural areas giving them a buffer for labor, which also makes the whole rail building system make more sense.

Tony Blair is very right about chinas ascendance, but for a moment regale us with what happened to China and Russia at the outset of this war: Russia asked China for aid and the west threatened sanctions on China, China said the west had no power over them and that the west should stay out of the totalitarian worlds domineering interests. But, when push came to shove China did not give military support to their “Unlimited friend” the Russians specifically because they know that any sanctions leveled on them would do far worse to their completely western dependent economy than what has been happening to Russia.  Of course China could care less about Russia, but it was chinas big chance to be super power and it wilted, now the west is cancelling partnerships with China and Chinese companies, they are spending hundreds of billions to cancel and supplant Chinese projects in the west. America is openly supporting Taiwan and pledging more assistance and even military cooperation. Russia and China will have to do without western relationships of consequence now.  They asked for a multipolar world, the world that tony Blair is talking about is a new Cold War, one where the west rips away demand for Chinese cheap products for alternatives while also maintaining a stranglehold on the Asia pacific through American military might.

Thats not how corruption works in china and it is much different to how corruption works anywhere that has a liberal democratic foundation.  Corruption keeps people loyal, when its time to remove said official, for whatever reason, including distracting the populace from the dogshit you have steered them in to with a pandemic, you use the catch-all ""corruption"" and the people cheer as you remove the corrupt tumor who you actually didn't just allow but you yourself promoted and fostered.  Thats how totalitarian and authoritarian regimes work.  Thats how russia works, thats how China works.  The institutions are not transparent, corruption is whatever the party says is corruption and you just have to believe them.

""A process that resembles meritocracy"", yet loyalty is the first prerequisite and then competence. IE the pandemic raging in china and the locking of people inside their homes, killing of pets and the ""public service announcements"". Xi knew nothing about the true scope of the pandemic, he was told what he wanted to hear because thats how totalitarian regimes operate.  Trump was told what he didn't want to hear, the american people were told what trump didn't want them to hear and he couldn't do shit about it except look like a baffoon, and then he is out of office.  Theres a reason why american institutions are trusted over totalitarian institutions for the investment of moneys.

Of course america has to have a conversation about gun laws and the extent of government regulation and oversight, these are conversations that the mainlander and the ccp will never have together about anything, because there is not discussion, there is only mandate.  

You don't get a say in your representative, in legistlation, the state is ALL powerful and the only thing that is holding the CCP in power is the fact that chinese are able to go out and make money, once that goes away, you will have a very angry populace and tienanman square will look very tame.",t3_w17jqd,1658129631.0,2

13582,jn8lfud,t3_142xp8g,"In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. 

The reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. 

However, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. 

The entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. 

Almost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. 

So there are two big points to make here. 

1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. 

2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. 

Nvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. 

Tesla at 64
Microsoft at 36
Apple at 30
Google at 28 


So you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't.

Then refi'd in 2021 at 3% on a 20 year fixed, knocking off 6 years to pay off the house and saving over $200k in interest payments for about the same monthly payment.

House is up 53% in value compared to local comps since we bought and our zip code continues to climb, up 4% Y2Y at the moment with supply still massively short compared to demand in our market (mature Northeast market with zoning prohibiting just about all new build). Multiple houses in our neighborhood have gone for $1.1 - 1.7 mil in the past couple months, all but one sold in 3 days or less and all cash buyers who don't give a shit about the current rates.

14128,j2heo2f,t3_100es82,"As you can see, the chart tried to break to the upside first, and then to the downside. But finally came back into the equilibrium Area.

Currently you are in an uptrend channel, that approaches the all time high.

The price already bounced from the lower channel. Now we want to see a clean, strong move to the upside, to set a clear uptrend in this chart.

All the best for 2023!

Edit: to expand a little on the too good to ignore shit, personally and im pretty sure widely agreef by techy peeps, apple has actually started making somewhat cool stuff, after firing that shitty design guy Johnny ive or whatever, the new pro ipads and macs are way better for creators, and they started fixing shit like their awful keyboards (which they refused to fix for fucking years!), stuff like that mostly around the board, even if they have some unresolved problems like still using lightning... i think lightning cables just make them too much money to change, thank fuck eu is forcing them though",t3_yt9aj0,1668285332.0,4

It's like onstar or those other services that car manufactures give you for the first two years free then after you have to pay for that subscription. I am young so I admit I can be naive but to me I've seen allot of people say that Apple will stop growing or other decrease in value because they only have their iPhones and eventually people will stop buying them since its the same thing. I have heard those sentiments since 2018 and now there a $2T company.

As a Californian student, I might be biased but people genuinely love Apple. They will buy Apple even if the competitors are producing hardware that is more capable or even cheaper. Apple has a grip on the industry not because they create better than their competitors but by creating differently than their competitors. The new generation seems to love not just the products of Apple but what they stand for. Challenging the status quo and innovating.

That being said, I don't know how Apple would continue to grow their business on a large scale, meaning what other service they can provide or piece of technology they can develop but they have a good track record of continuing to develop different ideas. There products have some of the highest margins compared to their competitors and their service revenue margins are even higher than their product ones.

Apple rails Amazon as a business. Apple's product line is an entire ecosystem. They can rule your phone all the way to your computer and make everything seemless. 

I know the fucks behind the Wendy's dumpster don't have corporate jobs, but Apple makes a killing on corporate sales that is ever increasing and has a ridiculously strong reputation in consumer cellphones.

They've even monotized other high end accessories like their airpods to return insane margins or their watches.

Amazon the shipping business is garbage at this point that will implode. AWS will continue forward but that will be their only cornered market and is one people will fiercely fight for

My point is just that for all their niche dominance, Apple is just that, a niche  product line.

Amazon has a much broader market reach and far more versatility in my opinion. And the constant hate on their retail business is nuts. Walmart has been one of the largest and most successful businesses in U.S. history as a pure retailer. Amazon offers that and far more.

I own both company's. But a much larger position in AMZN.",t3_10suguu,1675491550.0,1

16074,j74fzov,t1_j74f3q3,"Microsoft Office doesn't innovate either. They just happen to carry a product that consumers cannot continue to function without.

That ecosystem is not about branding or flex value. Its about having your whole business or personal life intertwined with Apple products. Your pictures are on iCloud, your watch notifies you of an email, your airpods switch from your phone to your macbook when you sit down. It's a trap in essence but so well executed that people willingly walk in and will be hard to make leave.

16078,j756u5d,t1_j755e5o,"Yup, exactly. Meta got crushed by Apple's privacy changes and Google is terrified of ChatGPT. Meanwhile Amazon can use people's exact buying history for targeting ads, and like you said at point of sale.

Their third party seller services also grew by 24% while their online retail actually went down. They are slowly converting their retail business into a third-party driven logistics and shipping company with insane customer data collection. That's going to have so much better margins than online retail, and they already have the infrastructure in place for it.

17095,ipjjefk,t3_x0fw8b,"Thank you for the write up. It’s great. 

Here is something I wrote previously: 

Some headlines recently mentioned that Apple has told suppliers to prepare for higher iPhone 14 pro sales volume. Great. It seems like a fantastic product with lots of updates that make it a great value. On top of that, they didn’t increase the prices on any of the models which shocked most people. And it should, because it is a certainty that the phone is now more expensive to produce and deliver into peoples hands than it was a year ago. Honestly, it’s a great move by Apple. The headline of “Fancy phone company increases prices because of inflation” would not have gone over well. They are going to eat the short term hit to profitability for long-term goodwill. It’s a genius, long-term oriented strategy. Plus they probably had no choice if they wanted to maintain revenue numbers.

But what about profits? Apple is great at the supply chain, cost structure, and all of that stuff. But there is no way they can offset higher chip prices and material costs. 

So what did they do to help improve the profitability of the iPhone business segment? They slapped new packaging on the previous years lower end iPhone offerings and removed the worst selling low end model. Almost nothing has changed on the lower end models. According to Statista, the lower end model accounted for a majority of iPhone sales as recently as 2021. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/804398/us-iphone-sales-by-model/) There is probably better data out there, but the point is that the sales of the low end iPhone are really important. If they just slapped new packaging on the phone, why would anyone buy it? 

I don’t know. But I do know that it makes the higher end iPhone a much better deal. And this is holding true: “Apple expects 85% of early adopters to opt for a pro model” https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/09/iphone-14-sales/ and https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/19/apple-supplier-shifts-production-to-make-more-iphone-14-pro-models

How could 85% of early adopters opting for a pro model be a good thing if more than 50% of iPhone sales should come from the lower end iPhone? I’m no math magician, but something seems off there.   I’m sure people are talking about this, but I’ve personally stopped watching/listening to most news sources. 

All in all, Apple has a large and complex business, there are certainly other levers they are pulling to increase profitability. But it seems a near certainty to me that profitability is going to continue to decline while revenue may also decrease. I really don’t know, but I would certainly gamble on the stock going down via November 120 puts. Timing is everything though. Apple going down should bring down the stock market as well even if most stocks are doing well.",t3_x0fw8b,1663893969.0,2

The first price hike since 2017 (I believe) is coming to the iPhone in America this year, it’ll be interesting to see if Americans pay more money for the most incremental upgrade in the history of the iPhone.

MacBooks are currently selling a lot because of the M1 upgrade. I view that as a super cycle or whatever you want to call it, just like the iPhone X. Mac revenue was down 10.4% YOY last quarter.

iPad revenue has already been in decline as well. The revenue was down 2% YOY last quarter.

Let's say earnings continue to decline, the Fed funds rate hits 4%, and Apple hits 120ish by end of the year. Not saying this is going to happen, just a hypothetical. If they have to stop or reduce their buyback, isn't that a warning sign to the market?

I will say that the QA on their recent products has been shit and based on my reading of /r/apple over the years (I was all in on Apple calls in 2018, I used to be a huge Apple bull), their most hardcore fans have noticed. The last generation of MacBooks before the M1 had issues with the butterfly keyboards leading to an extended warranty program, the iPhone throttling after a year, and don't even get me started on the AirPod Pros. I've had mine replaced at least 4 times due to issues with crackling, that's another extended warranty program they have. Now the new ones I have are crackling worse than ever and they refuse to replace them.

Apple has cut a lot of corners on quality assurance over the last few years (or more) to try to juice their margins, but it's starting to have an adverse effect on their products, people notice this stuff. There's a reason their wearable revenue was down 7.9% year over year last quarter, that's the AirPod segment (as well as the watch).",t3_x0fw8b,1661797738.0,2

Take a look at phones, androids exist and a slew of other alternatives as well as other ""next gen"" modifications are pushed. Whacky curved screens, etc. Apple simply wins here because other companies dont have the funding to continuously pump out tech as well as make solid products against a tech giant. A monopoly. 

Airpods. The newest and greatest thing marked up to what was it, $50-80? Look on Amazon, there are MANY wireless ear phones now and I have one working amazingly for $24. I couldn't justify the cost for the earphones. It felt like picking up a beats by dre as opposed to saving $50 for similar quality headphones. (I mean seriously, try it. It's $24. Don't get me started on iPad-similar products. Albeit I admit their iPad was a great invention)

Point being, they make good products. But just good. Prices are completely unjustified. 

Other companies undercutting them and making even better products or showing that the price tag is simply a markup and not the true value will happen time and time again. As zoomers turn to 2nd boomers, they will want less bullshit and more reliability.

It's cool you're a fan of Apple and think its stock is unassailable.

But do you have any evidence based support of your very special feelings?

Does your Apple boner blind you to the recession, decline in consumer discretionary income, savings rate, household savings, home prices? 

The company is already saying they're expecting poor sales.

What's the logic. ""It'll be fine because Apple.""

People said the same thing about Tesla, Google and Amazon.

If you want to know when we've bottomed, it's when Apple has taken its hit.

That means blind retail investors have left the market. That's what happens at a true market bottom.

If I'm wrong, tell me why. Give me reasons. I'd love to know so that I don't make a bad trade.

If you're just going to toss out some dumb zingers, enjoy. Unfortunately, I give exactly zero fucks for someone's opinion if they can't even make a cogent argument to support their point of view.

Institutional players know that all the average joes are looking at the same thing, waiting to short at the obvious peak, or resistance level, from last year. So, all the institutional players have to do is to push the stock price momentarily higher as soon as all the shorting has taken place. This will put all those average joes underwater and trigger their (short) stop losses. This leads to a large short covering under which the stock price skyrockets (a squeeze). While the stupid shorts are all covering, the institutional players will be selling to them at stupidly high prices. Note that all this action takes place intraday, the average joes I'm referring to are all those retail day traders who are all eagerly awaiting for the stock price to hit 289 (thinking no one else is seeing that) in order to quickly enter their shorts.

17737,jnjjqdh,t3_144dm87,"I just wrote a detailed analysis on the behavior of some of you regards of what you consider a ""short squeeze"" of another famous symbol this week that I did the research on.

Reality is, what you regards think is a short squeeze, is likely just a buying rally. Yes shorters will have to close their positions when the stock rallies 50-100-200% but then it's only up because some regard bought it at that high premium. When the shorts are closed, a continued rally only means a bag holder passing the bag.

GL yall squeezing these evil wallstreets. In reality yall just squeezing each other :)

Basically, the idea is that after 2008 Boomers really started passive investing- just parking their money in an index fund and leaving it for retirement. The theory is that when they cash out their retirement in a few years it will cause a bank run of sorts and crash index funds as well as the underlying stock (in the case of VOO or SPY that's the s+p 500).

I don't necessarily think boomers will crash the stock market, but I do believe the idea is right. All it would take would be a sell off scary enough to make other people pull out and we could very well see index funds hit the shitter.

Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. 

Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; 

https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/

A discounted future cash flow model HAS to be compared to the current market price for it to have any relevance.

“Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in many years,” Powell complained.

The Fed’s proposed solution: bring down wages.

2. I absolutely don’t see the case for Jpow cutting rates to address the debt ceiling fallout. JPow was bullied into not raising rates in 2018 and it is clear that was a massive mistake. I don’t think he will make the mistake of using the Fed to fix political economic crisis again. He even said in the FOMC meeting that the debt ceiling is not the responsibility of the Fed. In this case, I believe him. He’s not going to risk his image/legacy to fix the fallout of a MAGA political stunt. The capitulation will have to be political. 
3. A ban on short selling just isn’t going to happen unless a 2008 level event occurs. It won’t be a trigger but a reaction to an already occurring crisis. I don’t think a temporary sell off due to the debt ceiling stunt will qualify. To get political capitulation on the debt ceiling, politicians have to let the stock market suffer in the short term so they can blame the other party for ‘holding our economy hostage’

18136,jk384o4,t1_jk36v2s,"Option trading has been my bread and butter for decades.  i don't trade options like most though.  I use very simple chart formations (only 4 of them) and then choose strikes OTM and durations twice as long as I think I will need.  On average I hold between 30--45 days.  Often its much less because I get lucky.  

UVIX is a derivative of a derivative.  I do not like that.  Even when I have conviction, for example I am holding SPY puts, I wont do a 2x or 3x ETF.  too much decay.  I am not smart enough to track the greeks.  In fact, when I managed others money I never used the greeks.  They are important but not for what I am doing.

If I were not comfortable with options, I would probably use a high yield ETF but the problem is, the VIX has decoupled from it.  I can tell you that if I am right, and I strongly beleive I am, I buy options that are far out of the money and longer durations.  It gives me time to roll and reduces the decay.

Cash is a position.  Capital preservation is a trade.  think about the performance of a portfolio if they avoided losing periods.  Its hard to not be invested in the market - until a crash starts.  I dont know how bad it will get but I do know how bad it was in 2008 when I was managing money and I saw what was going on.

Do you remember what the Fed did after 2008?  no banks were lending so they gave the TBTF banks a shit ton of money to lend, money that came from you and I in the form of bailouts.  The banks said they would lend it out.  they didn;t - they put it in the market.

There is a reason why most people can only be level 1 options approved: covered calls and cash puts.  Because the industry knows its impossible to be right on time AND price, which is what an option contract is.  Something like 90% of long options expire worthless.  Guess who is on the other side keeping those premiums?  Guys like me or rather guys like I used to be - I was an option seller because I knew those facts but I always knew the one that mattered: every week, there would be 2 days where theta decay would go in my favor, bc the market was closed.

Not trying to induce you to join, although I welcome anyone who wants to learn in an environment free of idiots, but I wanted you to know I dont cherry pick.  I went through a period where about 7 of my option plays hit my stops.  not a big deal due to position sizing.  This one is different bc I I have a higher level of confidence.  I have been short SQ, SPY, CMBS, AMC (was also long for a time) and NVDA.  I obviously got stopped out on NVDA and my PG short.  All via options.

I normally do not trade the VIX.  I trade options.  But, in my investing lifetime I have observed the VIX spike regularly.  The hard part is getting exposure and then having to use options that have a fixed duration/term.  The VIX is not to be traded bc thats not what it was created to for.  It literally was created for portfolio managers to hedge risk against future possible market moves.  Insurance.  Today it is tradeable so for me, it is the best asset to have exposure to what I think is a mismatch in the risks I see most probable to develop and the price I have to pay.  The fact that its being manipulated was my trigger.

But I didnt offer my opinion to convince people to buy the VIX.  Really what I wanted to share was my belief, with supporting materials, that I believe the VIX, oil, inflation is being suppressed and why.  I want people to wake up and realize that investing is seriously rigged against them.  Its become so blatant and so ridiculous that i decided to start a sub and help inform people.  

QQQ is very tempting, especially with the view I shared on aapl.  People get pissed when I say I want to get short appl.  Who cares.  Its my money not theirs.  I never let others tell me what to do with my money.  Unfrotunately, most investors do let others tell them what to do bc they dont know where to find good information and knowledge.  I am trying to pay it forward so to speak.  Eventually I will monetize traffic to my website but from those who want to daytrade futures.  

From a total portfolio perspective, I have the VIX short, 50% of the total, SPY puts, 10%, a couple of long positions (20%) and then cash.  So I am heavily short.  I am not a bear or a bull - I just trade wherever and whatever I believe has a mismatch in price and a high prob to profit.

I see what you are saying about those vehicles affecting options but the VIX is used so that the portfolio can get to a specific delta.  And they adjust daily, at least the bigger firms do.

This is the misunderstanding I think. The dollar is almost surely going to keep inflating and its ability to buy real things will continue to decrease. 

However, the dollar inflating is not necessarily bearish for the dollar index. It would only be bearish for the dollar index if the dollar inflated *faster* than other currencies, which it is not. The US dollar is in the best situation right now by far compared to most of these other countries. Europe and Japan don't have nearly the same amount of room to keep their monetary policy tight. 

It seems like you're confusing the relative strength of the dollar against other currencies with the absolute strength of the dollar (ability to buy real things).

I agree with you that the news outlets are in bed with the banks but I don't see that much bearish stuff on the mainstream news right now, at least on Bloomberg. I would say the majority of the commentary is bullish, though it remains mixed.",t3_13h1w4q,1684090482.0,1

18254,jk3g9ea,t1_jk3d90x,"It has to do with the way I think.  The farther out the timeline, the further away you get from the data points that originally made me make my investment decision, so the more risk and the lower probability.  I like higher prob and lower risk which caused me not to want to own anything long term.  I had some advantages such as the time to constantly be looking for investments since it was my day job.

So, over time I developed a love for options.  But not the way 90% of people use them which is as a cheaper alternative to the stock.  Thats not smart.  I use them when the variables I want are present.  I also have a LOT of actual real life experience figuring out what duration works best for what I want to accomplish.  Generally speaking, I live quarter to quarter in options bc of earnings releases.  They can be an outlier and therefore something I cannot quantify.  SO I arrived at a style where why max hold is typically 30-45 days.

In the event I am forced to hold longer, I also have the ability to roll them.  I used to use iron condors or I was a seller of premium but tbh, it was too much work, and not very effective over a large sample of trades.

Dollar cost averaging doesnt work for me bc when I invest, its a binary decision: its going up or going down.  If it goes opposite the direction I chose, then I was wrong and I move on.  Maybe I get stopped out and the same stock/etf comes up again on my screening process.  I enter a new trade based on new data.

But the big advantage and why I like options is leverage.  I can capture, depending on the strike relative to the underlying, 50% to 70% of the move, if I am right, for a fraction of the capital.  that results in less capital at risk which means I can have more positions.

I used to tell my clients: I want to date a stock not marry it.  I totally mean it.  I dont want to have to read through all the filings, all the news, for months and years.  I want to do my analysis, make my decision, and then move on.

Its probably why I enjoy daytrading also.  I dont like long term.  If I am right, I want to get paid, today.

Finally, the way I do it allows me to be in cash when I want to be thereby reducing my exposure significantly.  The portfolio I post in my sub, real time, was up a lot in Feb of this year ( took january off after i retired in dec) - since then, I have given back about half bc of stops taken, but i am still up a lot.  More than you would think.  Point is, I have less time risk, less overall work bc I dont have to track every single news or filing, and I have less stress.

What I do works fine for stocks too but I just like options.  the VIX and SPY positions are different than my core anyway -they are what I call ""story plays.""  I am making an educated guess on what I think could happen and then calculating a probability for it, as well as my expected return if it does happen, and my loss if it doesnt.  My expected return is never less than 3x my possible loss.  usually its much higher.

I hope that makes sense.",t3_13h1w4q,1684052458.0,23

18335,ivz07jq,t3_ysh3zh,"For the folks here, the next things I think to watch are $TSLA for more downside on Elon selling. News is leaking that his debtors are trying to sell the twitter debt for about 0.6 on the dollar $. This is not good for Elon as they could demand more capital from him (selling Tesla stock for it).

The second thing I think worth watching is $DIS. If Bob Chapek gets fired the stock will be up 5-10% on the news. I have no idea when so I am watching and listening. The market wants him OUT.",t3_ysh3zh,1668188612.0,43

I had a strong feeling it was going to come in lower and also got apple calls and sold both at close Friday, so only held for 2 days. Flipped to puts on Disney because I think the hype will settle and the eps was horrid. I think Disney is short term bearish for puts but definitely adding shares at this price for a longer term swing. Congrats on the tesla wins!

18362,ivyyzef,t1_ivyyqvg,I had several plays. You can check my post history. I wrote a DD on Tesla and apple a month ago.that they were in danger. The big one was 185 puts starting last week when Tesla was around 220 ish. I was holding when Elon was selling and we had 3 -5% days. I made about 30k off of 5k.,t3_ysh3zh,1668188129.0,31
18363,ivyzbkt,t1_ivyyxu3,That's exactly what I am waiting on. I want it to get a relief rally in before I go deeper. I remain convinced that Elon will have to sell more stock. I'd like to save the theta and Delta though. It doesn't seem as imminent right now as it did post deal closing.,t3_ysh3zh,1668188262.0,11

18683,io3rmp5,t3_xc08j1,"This DD is so dumb it makes my head hurt.

1. Comparing to Geostationary communications is idiotic. Those are very limited services that people have high demand for and will pay excessive fees for. Extrapolating that to a constellation of LEO satellites sold to the masses is like extrapolating Bugatti car prices to Camry buyers.
2. Your math is wrong. Using your own numbers it is not $3.63B but $1.8B
3. The GB a month availability per satellite is based on what? I saw estimates of 40 gbps, which would come to 540,000 GB a month, far less than 1.8 million GB's a month. Plugging 540,000 GB a month into your calculation gets you $540M a year in revenue.
4. Assuming 10% of capacity is sold is a pipe-dream. Most of the world is covered in water so about 70% of capacity is going to be unused because of that. Then there are vast sparsely inhabited places on earth (e.g. the Sahara) that would not have enough users to saturate the service (i.e. because if it was used to capacity there, it would be overextended in more dense places). No idea what % of capacity would get used but 10% is probably the most bullish scenario you can come up with.
5. At $10 a GB, people will limit use of the satellites for talk and sms and not use it for data. It would just be too expensive. Not working through the calculations but would assume actual capacity used ends up being under 5%... so even assuming $10 per GB that is now $250 million in revenue a year. Realize this service is being envisioned as an add-on to a land-based service. Very few people are going to be willing to pay excessive amounts on top of their expensive cell service for this.
6. Beyond anything above, the simple physics of it says that providing broadband via your 5G smartphone is not a very economical business as the number of satellites needed to be launched would be in the tens of thousands, not 168. What does work is basic phone service (talk, SMS, and some data). There are I think over 8 billion cell phone subscribers in the world if each can pay $1 a year that is $8 billion in potential revenue to ensure basic coverage worldwide. Providing such service will be competitive between any player putting up satellites for this and the actual revenue will be determined based on how reliable your network is and what is the lowest cost you can charge for it. So rather than even that $8 billion dollar number perhaps this whole industry will be worth at most a few billion in revenue a year.
7. SpaceX will be putting up satellites that are already being used for internet service and adding on the phone services is a low cost addition. So consider that your competition. There are also other companies vying for this space.
8. I have to wonder about the speed assumptions made about ASTS... my mind tells me a lower bandwidth satellite that covers a smaller area (e.g. the SpaceX ones) will likely be better suited for being able to saturate that bandwidth over a bunch of connections as opposed to a single higher bandwidth one listening in to more connections. I am not an expert in the technical aspects here, but I suspect my thinking is right here. If correct, the bandwidth projections for ASTS are based on a few connections and not numerous connections, which is kind of a huge deal as it might very well mean their are underestimating by far the number of satellites needed.

Basically the revenue assumptions here are wildly optimistic. This is literally a bottom of the barrel value added service that pricing will be determined based on who can provide it the cheapest and most reliably. I am guessing that the reason T-Mobile said they should be able to provide this for no additional cost (or maybe some minimal amount) is because SpaceX realized that this is not a service you can charge much for. As to why SpaceX would go into this business then; well for one, since they are already sending up satellites this is a small additional cost and two, this may be related to providing connected service to all their cars which is important for self-driving. Cars should have larger antennas built in that would enable faster communication and enable remote connectivity anywhere.

Bottom line, investing in this service at current valuations is simply idiotic and you will lose your money long-term when the economics here are clearly shown to not work out. I am sorry, but the numbers for these services when run diligently don't translate into this pipe-dream that is being sold here.",t3_xc08j1,1662976596.0,-12

And what does my Tesla investment have anything to do with this. Tesla is not a shareholder in SpaceX and I hold no shares of SpaceX. Frankly, if ASTS's service works great it has no real meaningful impact on either Tesla or SpaceX (whose main business will be Starship launches, not Starlink providing cell service... literally it is just a value added service that is intended to supplement other products and services).

It is not that I wish ill-will on ASTS, it is the claims being made don't add up and people not doing DD are buying into them.

For anyone trying to understand the math of why their service claims are bogus I responded last week to a comment (see below). Scroll down to the lower comments to see an actual discussion based on bandwidth projections for ASTS and I calculated there they would need 40,000 satellites, not 168, to achieve anything close to the claims, pumpers like Tana1234 suggest.

Maybe they can sell that to 100,000 before risking failing at their claims (i.e. if people will pay a premium for such a service then you would figure they would make extensive use of it). So even if $100 a month (well you can just get a Starlink terminal with far more bandwidth in that case, but whatever... oh, just understand that future starlink terminals will likely have smaller more portable options to operate in conjunction with the new larger v2 satellites... basically as cost for ASTS service goes up for many they may find it makes more sense to just go the Starlink terminal route, especially if this is being used at home or you are traveling with a vehicle that can hold the terminal) that is $23 million year. Increase that number a bit more and still revenues don't get that high.

For everyone else, you will only have capacity to provide basic phone service and I see carriers picking between ASTS or SpaceX (or others) based on who would provide this at the lowest cost (why do carriers care who they use as long as they can provide this essential service). Providing phone service is pretty trivial and once you provide in one place you can in theory provide anyplace else so you are talking as commoditized a service as you get with pricing just high enough to cover operating costs and not much profit.",t3_xc08j1,1663052454.0,1

It is drivel because they take the company's PR as the word of God and never sat down and took out their crayons and tried doing the math based on the limitations of physics.

The bottom comment in our prior exchange I give a rough calculation of what bandwidth the can possibly service. I don't know how you will get this through your think skull but the projected constellation cannot physically provide anything more than some minimal bandwidth per subscriber, far below any measure called broadband.

It is simple math and you would do yourself a favor to either do the math or explain where my calculations are so wrong that anything close to what they aim for is possible.

Regarding the limitations of physics, only after doing the math did I appreciate the presentation T-Mobile and SpaceX had where Elon very much was not promoting a vision of broadband via cell phones. It is not that it is impossible to provide broadband but to do so would require constellations or antennas magnitudes larger than anything ASTS or SpaceX is suggesting. On the other hand you can do it with bigger and more powerful antennas on earth (e.g. Starlink terminals which give you a signal to space orders more powerful than anything your cell phone can do... avoiding the need for larger or more numerous constellations to provide such broadband service).

People over reacting to the robot thing like it's some sort of gotcha, mostly because they hate elon. It's literally irrelevant. 

Maybe in 5 years it might be useful. Maybe it will flop. Either way irrelevant for Teslas share price, much like how googles many flops like stadia, google plus etc are irrelevant for its share price. Anyone remember Toyotas robot? That company is fine too.

18816,ir2jvoc,t1_iqzkx51,"I think of it this way: PE is currently around 85. A lot of people just simplistically look at that and think it's in a bubble and way over valued. That may sound like a lot but earnings has been growing at a cagr of 50% pa. That implies they reach a ""mature"" PE of 15 in about 5 years. To reach a PE of 30 (a fairly normal multiple for tech co with growth potential) is 3 years. If they have misses it will take a bit longer. Does that growth rate seem unreasonable or not achievable to you? It means they have to sell roughly 3-5x the number of cars, which I think is definitely possible given crazy EV demand at the moment. Crucially it's not asking for 10x, which I would start to consider having serious risk of achieving because 20 mil a year is a lot.

Now obviously it gets harder to grow as they get larger, but also economies of scale may come into play to increase earnings e.g. selling software and insurance to their fleet. This is one of they key things I think people sleep on with tesla, they can make a lot of money just selling software, much like apple turned to after selling a lot of Iphones. Also maybe some of their other projects like energy will contribute.

At the moment, given the track record I don't think it's unreasonably expensive. I'd consider it about fair at $250. If it was to drop another 10+% I would start considering it cheap.",t3_xus0u3,1664918566.0,1
18817,ir43elo,t1_ir2jvoc,"Yes, keeping up their current growth rate for 3-5 years is unreasonable to me, this is where our outlook differ the most. They sell cars, not apps. Let's forget about the infrastructure scaling, shipping scaling, etc. From 200k to 300k and from 2 million to 3 million is both an 50% jump, but will there be enough demand (for their $50-100k cars), while others are already catching up? Teslas EV market share is dropping year by year, and yes, they still sell every EV they make, just like all the other major EV manufacturers. This is true right now, but for how long? I honestly think that they will plateau by 2025-2026 (maybe following with normal, 5-10% growth from there), I think their margin will also drop to ~20-25% max, and their current valuation is just not attractive for me, because they are already valued like its 2026 right now. Obviously I might be wrong and they might pull out another miracle like they always do, haha! I am in XPEV, NIO, Volkswagen, GM and TM right now, I see all these companies having a better valuation and possible future growth in market cap compared to Tesla. I am also in a couple of lidar companies. I wish you the best though, the more Tesla grows the more the EV industry grows, which would be great for both of us!",t3_xus0u3,1664945117.0,1

As it falls your money gains value slowely and food becomes cheaper and what you worked so hard for before covid gains all its value back. If u had a balanced portfolio or a money manager it should remain relatively the same. If its not they failed you but relative is the key word. Might even gain u money. But if u r to risky or to conservative idk. Doesnt pay to be risky when things are already against you.,t3_xdb6bm,1663154579.0,1

19045,iwzv8nb,t3_yvyu5w,"Food for thought: transistor count(not necessarily density) is going up every year inline with moores law (40% APR). Price per transistor has been steady for some years already. Capex is increasing less than 40% a year. Extrapolating, you can keep increasing capex but you’ll be able to recoup every dollar through sale of increasing number of transistors and maintain your ROIC.

Also, as mentioned above, older nodes have been fully depreciated already but are still generating cashflow. If at all thats some incredible ROIC on just maintenance capex.

Admittedly scrutinize the numbers enough then you can still find tons of holes in the above logic which only looks at the internal situation. But consider the following external/industry dynamic: Every time you invest in a new node ahead of your competitors, you are capturing more market share. Everytime you run your older nodes beyond their depreciated asset life, you are killing any new entrants to the older nodes.

This gives fabs incredible pricing power beyond any forecast we make here. Essentially they will set their ROIC targets and price accordingly. Not the other way around of pricing to the market to achieve ROIC.

It is where intel wants to be in the future and TSMC is at today.

19187,jojfg2s,t3_14c7cby,"Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, ""What goes up must come down"". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:

* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)
* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future
* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).
* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to ""try it out""? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate ""a new world"". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.
* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.
   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *""once given, it's hard to go back""*.

Overall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.

**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand.

apple doesn't innovate 
-they don't have to they improve what others do and implement it in a way only apple can 

people are afraid of recessions and inflation 
-doesn't matter apple users know it's expensive and they've been buying for decades, eventually they'll come around. after working in telecommunications for years i know what phone is always sold out for months prior to release and preorders are rolling in from all income brackets. they don't even care about china based supply chain issues i've had people wait for 4 months for their 14 pro. 

sales decline 
-they literally started a savings account and their software revenue and subscription revenue is increasing faster than iphone sales decline 

they're up so much people will sell out 
-yes that's what always happens, take some gains or buy in when it drops. 
----------------------

rambling: 

apple is pretty much near its intrinsic value right now imo. the only thing i think people truly underestimate is how little the market cares about what anyone thinks. people have been saying apple is overvalued since 2017 and they said after the covid crash that it's still overvalued after it rebounded a bit and yet here we are apple is still going up without mentioning AI even once. 

they said the same about costco and yet it keeps going up because people are willing to pay for that premium. the thing with apple is that it's ultimately a consumer staple company. you could just as easily buy berkshire stock and get pretty much good apple exposure and diversification into other sectors with less big tech downside risk.

the bear case of apple is always the same they're overbought and stopped innovating since the first iphone which is not even remotely close to true. 

they always show up late to the party with stuff ""android did first"" and yet they still sell because they either improve it or make it intuitive enough that people who are already in the ecosystem just get to use it like it's always been there. nobody is going to switch to android for a feature samsung and google pumped out to stay relevant in the phone market when they know they'll get the same thing with the apple quality approval a few years later and they just wait for it. 

people laughed at the iphone price back then, they laughed at the transparent mac, they said the vision pro is too expensive and all the tech review youtubers say it's a wonderful piece of technology only the fans and enthusiasts will buy. 

i disagree on that i think the vision pro is going to shatter all expectations and will sell better than expected, simply because most of the downsides that other headsets have, apple atleast has some form of solution and while not perfect it's still a new product for the ecosystem. and because i've been here long enough to know that people suck when it comes to being financially responsible so even low income earners will manage to get their hands on it even though they shouldn't. 

people have been saying microsoft is in a decline and it only goes down from there they have peaked and they're a boomer stock. suddenly microsoft establishes itself as AI trailblazer and keeps staying relevant and growing into all directions. the thing with valuation and big tech is that big tech doesn't work like ford or coca cola where old companies slowly hit their peak and then just use pricing power to increase dividends so old people don't sell the stock they've been holding and to offer a nice alternative during the times where big tech doesn't do much besides firing employees and find new ways to get more data out of customers to sell. 


as long as they're not grossly overpriced, in todays market probably around 200 per share you probably could just buy one per month as a savings plan and still get good money out of it even though it's probably going to pull back a bit during july. 

you could do what no one dares to do here and buy shares or calls with 1-2 years expiration and end up in the green. and if you lose then it's just the same outcome as anything else you've tried so far so the downside risk is status quo and the upside potential is making money for once.

1. Greed. Tim Cook retires and leaves the wrong person in charge… A change in management to people who value trying to blow analysts predictions out of the water  every quarter… Better wxplanation of what I’m saying - Most of the time apple comes in or beats the numbers however it never seems to be good enough… current management doesn’t batt an eye, just stays the course… Bean counter management could take over, fire 90% of the talent and cut quality standards a lot and achieve stellar $ results for several quarters… long term results would be a major crash of the company with the bean counter management exiting with billion dollar parachutes leaving a Skelton. Ex: Apple buying an airline, apple buying Proctor and Gamble, Apple buying Quickrete so they could have AppleKrete concrete… Apple buying up Home building companies…. Now you can have an apple house…. 

2. Apple looses focus and uses its huge cash pile to start buying anything and everything in an attempt to be a behemoth. Example: GE buying up companies that they had no idea how to run, operate long term… AT&T buying Direct TV… Westinghouse…. Any and all newspaper companies. Sure the internet killed them in the end but corporate greed, firing of skilled staff for inexperience, low wage workers so they could keep their golf club memberships was the hammer to the glass… Our Grandfathers had their entire nest egg in these companies as they were the Apple of the day and lost tons…
For now Apple is a solid, stead growth company that you buy and hold long term while paying attention.

Disney’s media business is currently in getting disrupted as the cable bundle continues to decline and streaming requires an ungodly amount of capital. On the other hand, the iPhone is one of the greatest businesses in history. Huge market, fantastic pricing power, smartphones are critical products for people worldwide, the App Store ecosystem. 

Apple’s end markets are somewhat weak at the moment. Pc’s are down, iPhone and iPad growth has been muted, etc. Based on how the stock is behaving, you’d think that they’d be growing 10-15%+ currently and that’s just not the case. IMO this stock run is being driven by index fund buying in the nasdaq, Russell 1000, and s&p 500. Apple is the largest part of any stock index. It’s also a massive part of any tech etf.

Wow, I can tell you with absolutely certainty that you're completely misguided with this take. I'm not trying to be a dick or anything, but I can just tell you that you couldn't be more wrong if you tried.

Meta is decades behind, but literally bought and owns the single company that completely revived a totally dead and buried virtual reality industry. VR existed before Oculus, but Oculus was the 2nd coming of VR. Oculus is the *real* beginning of VR.

Meta bought and owns this company. Meta has poured countless billions into VR and AR. Facebook invested so much into this that they have literally changed their name and ticker symbol. But they're decades behind. Ok...

Whatever you say

But just know this, if you're this wrong about this statement (and you're ridiculously wrong), how wrong are you about other investment thesis's?

When you're really wrong about an investment, it can be extremely hazardous. You can be wrong and still come out ahead (you likely would in the case of AAPL), but in other scenarios you could lose everything because of it.

Also, I'm not trying to say I'm some sort of savant or expert, because I've been absolutely dead wrong about many things and have lost giant amounts of money myself.

But compared to Nvidia, Apple is still a great buy.  (Even though I personally wouldn't go long on either right now.)

Just by using dumb people math with my crayons:

Apple brings in a net income of $100B, with a market cap of $3T.  At least on paper, Apple could ""buy"" itself in only 30 years.  That's a very profitable company.

Nvidia brings in a WHOLE $4.37B net income, with it's $1.054T market cap.  On paper it could ""buy"" itself in only a few years of 241 years.  That's not a profitable company to acquire at current valuation.

Price for entry is a bit higher but I think it will be a status symbol if you look a bit geeky and regarded. I bet tons of autistic kids will adopt it in a flash(they don't care about looking weird), specially if there is a emotion translator, happy -> sad etc and calendar with tasks etc.

I also wonder if you could configure outside display and print out filtered face with makeup. That way you will get lazy to put makeup on and you just use your avatar.

 >The lipstick effect is the theory that when facing an economic crisis consumers will be more willing to buy less costly luxury goods. Instead of buying expensive fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive lipstick. The underlying assumption is that consumers will buy luxury goods even if there is a crisis. When consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds.

It's no surprise that Buffett is bullish on Apple, given their long-term success and the fact that they have been a major part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for years. However, it's important to remember that the stock market is unpredictable, and even the most experienced investors can get it wrong sometimes. With that in mind, I think it's wise to do your own research and make your own decisions when it comes to investing.

Anyway, you may be right but to add to the echo chamber this is in fact priced in. Doubling down on this a lot of Chinese investors don't trust their government and keep assets in other countries thus American stocks could see a surge from this. 

Anyway my bet is that it does in fact come down but that's just because of the recent pattern where we go up before the Fed meets and down after. A lot of this fear is over exaggerated and the past doesn't reflect the future so time will tell.

Yeah that might not be a bad idea. As long as the options market isn’t to overpriced. Implied Volatility for apple is high. Hopefully there’s still some meat on the bone. You don’t wanna sell just because one bad day. I had a feeling it would snap right back. There wasn’t really any issue with their balance sheet. Sure supply chain issues are happening but that shit should be priced in. So as long as apple made/beat revenue the stock was gonna eventually snap back. Low P/E ratio comparable to other big tech companies like google and Tesla. It’s actually kinda a bargain. Even tho they didn’t deliver all the iPhones promised that doesn’t mean there isn’t demand. There’s tons of demand for new iPhones. They’ll keep printing money because they’re not just a tech company. They’re a hardware company. They have lots of liquidity streams. If if there was one tech company I wouldn’t bet against it would be apple. Google and Meta have been overblown for years. I mean how many google pixels do you see comparable to iPhones. Everyone has an iPhone and will continue to own iPhones. Writing this comment on an iPhone. Plus App Store royalties and AirPod/apple watch revenue…. Lots of ways to make money. Enough ways to make a slight miss in iPhone delivery look like nothing. A lot of ppl sold the first day after the release but the news was overblown and apple was oversold. Cheers gents.

20150,jho1d92,t3_12yndwa,"In case anyone wants some insight into why i entered these positions. \]

Longs

AMD I bought because it seemed like a good stock and they seem to be quite profitable as evident by their quarterly earnings. I bought high though

AMZN Seemed like a good chance to buy the dip last year i think around march or april the day it tanked after earnings

QQQ I sold puts and got assigned. Been selling covered calls for a year. Average is around 280s

SOFI I dont know why i bought. I was just gonna swing it for a week but it tanked and ever recovered

TQQQ Originally wanted to swing trade it but i couldnt bring myself to cutting losses

TSLA I couldve sold at 210s but i had a collar at the time and i didnt want to take the loss on the collar

Shorts

AAPL Stonk too high. no other reason

NVDA Returded >130% pump. It has to dump soon right?

NVDA Puts same reason \^

NVDA Naked Calls. I didnt feel comfortable added more shares to the short at the moment so i sold calls instead hoping to get a better entry + premiums. I collected around 1500 from the apr expirations and i hope to collect the full amount of these may expirations too

QQQ Covered call. Just to lower my average some more

Short Futes

I figured i should hedge my account with futes since i have quite a few long positions. Unfortunately i couldnt bring myself to close them at a loss so i kept adding to it which makes me overall a net short portfolio

Tsla Strangle. i thought that would be a wide enough range for the stock to move around and collect some risk free money",t3_12yndwa,1682438708.0,0

I have dig myself out of -30% to like -3% last week and I belive this week I'm breaking even and will catch up with SPY. 

I probably don't belong here for saying this, but what worked for me was selling everything at one point and going 100% cash. After that I waited for buying opportunity. What I did was waited for one of the bigger drops and loaded on high quality stuff dragged down by the market - mostly healthcare(CI, UNH, CNC), but not only and sold again on the next rise. Companies that I woudn't mind holding anyways for longer, for as cheap as possible. Basically swing trading, only stocks, not a single option. Took the money at average 5% gain on position, but I got 2-3 positions at most with 80% invested so if I make 5% on each of the 3 positions is like 10-12% total portfolio gain. And this seems to be working - buy low sell high. Not having exp. date helps a lot to wait it out until it pops. Never traded hyped up stocks, never will.

What do you expect from AMD at 95PE? What could reallisticly happen to that stock - five times more expensive than the average SPY company? Go to 150 PE? You are just gambling there, with extremely high chances of losing and very tiny chance of making insignificant profit.

1.) Jesus is able to heal your friend. He did it when he was on earth and he said we can do the same thing today through faith in his name.
2.) Pain and hardship is an unavoidable consequence of the sin that is in this world and in each one of us.  Jesus can't remove it until he takes full authority over the earth again and rules as king. In the meantime, if we follow Jesus he will always show us the best path through trials and use even the worst experiences for our good. Jesus himself lived a life of suffering while on earth and can completely identify with our experience.

Maybe someone is to blame, maybe no one is and it was just a freak event. Regardless, the point I was making is that everything bad that happens in this world is ultimately the result of man's choice to not live by the perfect laws of God. If sin had never entered in the world, evil, hurt and pain could never have come either.

3.) Love is Jesus deciding to give us chance after chance to change (repent) and the opportunity for a new start if we follow him.

20270,jhpi6l0,t1_jhpd5rl,"1.) Yes, God knew the future. But I don't think that it demonstrates a lack of love to allow something to happen even though there is a certainty of suffering. For example, a child would be unjustified in telling his parents that they don't love him because they choose to procreate even though they knew that that child would suffer in life. I don't know about you, but despite all the pain and suffering I've gone through in life, I'd rather have lived life, than to not have lived at all. 

2.) Yes, God has power. But to clarify, God is not the one starving, abusing or paralyzing. God uses these horrible situations but he is not the originator of them. God power is that he can bring beauty out of pain. We were given a choice to follow God's laws or to violate them. We chose and choose to sin. Originally it was not any easier to do the wrong thing than the right thing. In fact, man originally had to go out of his way to break God's law and do the wrong thing. Yes, today, most of the time it seems easier to do wrong than right, BUT, the good news is that if you receive a new start from Jesus because you decide to follow him, his spirit will live inside of you and it will once again be easier to live a right life, than to live a life of wrongdoing.

3.) I'm not sure I understand this question. God did create abundance. And he does intervene on behalf of people that are living their lives for him. And there is plenty of evidence for the historical Jesus as well as the power of Jesus today to change lives, heal the paralyzed, restore hearing to the deaf and many other miracles.

As for ancient Egyptian religion, from there origin stories all the way to the cult of Osiris, none of it matches the Bible.

They may be correct if you procreate without thought to the child and it brings them harm, putting them in bad situations or not being able to provide basic necessities, it's not uncommon and we punish parents in almost all non tribal societies for some of the same things God allows and does, which with his limitless resources would be complete neglect on his part.

2. This is a silly response, we chose nothing, he gave one choice to one person, while also having someone he also created tell them to sin. The equivalent of blaming a child for being kidnapped and abused by your partner when you knew it would happen. If creating situations to take advantage of them after that is his only power then that's not a benevolent God at all and seems more like a worshipper wanter than altruistic deity.

3. There is zero evidence of anything but people attributing it to him, I understand your want to share but he does not intervene, claims ""faith"" Aka believe what I say with no evidence and is something that was and maybe still is needed for unintelligent people to have a basic moral compass, but it's an outdated control tool and nothing more.",t3_12yndwa,1682459975.0,1

Free will and volition are fundamental laws of nature and human kind and God does not violate these principles.
2. No, we do choose our behavior. God isn't holding you responsible for the choice someone made 5,000 years ago. He holds you responsible for the choices you made today. God did not tell anyone to tell anyone else to sin. Man was not coerced into sinning anymore than you or I are coerced into making any of the bad decisions we make. God does not create these situations. He makes the best out of bad situations and decisions that others have made.

Horus? Lol, for the sake of this I'll call it a theory. That theory has more holes in it than a wiffle ball. Even agnostic Bible scholars have said its ridiculous. Horus wasn't the only begotten son of the living God, both God and man sent to Earth to die for the forgiveness of all sin. His story did involve death and resurrection, but so do many gods in many polytheistic religions found all over the world. None of them knew horus to copy him. So how is that possible??

Since you have demonstrated your inability to read my comments, the actual history of horus and the actual Bible, there's no point continuing this.

20283,jhpo05g,t1_jhpm11j,"1. Absolutely, if you're actively bringing harm or bring in your child and allow them to suffer while you have the ability to prevent it, are you a loving parent?

If you watch your child starve

If you watch them get smashed on a wall because their parents won't denounce their faith under threat of eternal pain(Bible is really wild)

At what point does God have any responsibility or is he just ""love me or suffer""?

2. Really? So you'd say the same to malnourished children? Are they choosing to sin by... being born and hungry? That is God's choice to set those circumstances up and allow people to be born with their minds in a way that promotes its continuance.

He did though according to the fables, he created the deceiver, and being omnipotent he both knew what that would lead to and what it would do to humans, consciously creating sin with that motion. Either being not powerful and able to see all or setting people up to fail are both contradictory to the image he speaks of. You ignore that he has no actual presence and offers no tangible help, he's as real as batman in that people can be inspired by, but are in no way realistically affected by an imaginary character, only their own minds justifications. If he had any power or was a God of love why not give undeniable proof of their existence?

20286,jhq3fz4,t1_jhpo05g,"1.) All parents allow their kids to do things that they know will bring suffering. A parent gives a kid a bike. They know the kid is going to fall over at some point in time... they know the kid is going to get hurt... but they also know that the kid will learn from the accidents and mistakes and get better. Also, responsible parents know that it is not always wise to keep children from suffering the consequences of their mistakes. God doesn't say love me or suffer. There are many people that love God that suffer as well. But God says, if you love me in the middle of your suffering I'm going to bring you to something much greater on the other side. Suffering is an unavoidable part of life BECAUSE sin is in the world. Suffering will not be a part of Jesus' kingdom when he comes back to reign because sin will be eradicated. If God were to get rid of suffering now, he'd have to get rid of evil and evil doers as well. God is patient, giving us the opportunity to repent before judgement; and in the meantime, because there is suffering in the world, he gives us a best possible outcome in every situation.

Here is the sermon my pastor preached two days ago on suffering, if you're interested:  
[https://www.youtube.com/live/MGfq9sjo8GY?feature=share&t=2676](https://www.youtube.com/live/MGfq9sjo8GY?feature=share&t=2676)

2.) I think I said this before, but I do not believe that people's suffering is directly correlated to decisions or choices they've previously made. A suffering infant is not suffering because of a decision they made. But they will/would eventually grow up to make sinful choices that demonstrate that they too have  violated the laws of God and nature. Yes, God allows things to continue like this for now, but again, the only way to stop it would be to eradicate all sin and evil. I, for one, am thankful that God is patient with us. And again, while sin and suffering continue in the world, God has not left us without a best possible outcome and a way to escape.

3.) I'm not sure that there's proof of anything in this world that would convince all skeptics... I mean some people still believe that the earth is flat or that man hasn't walked on the moon. But I do have proof of the power of Jesus to work miracles through faith in his name, but do you want it? I'm not sure why I'd be a trillionaire though. And I'm not sure what a snake oil testimony is.",t3_12yndwa,1682468874.0,0
20287,jhqhv0p,t1_jhq3fz4,"1. There is a marked difference between letting a child ride a bike and letting children starve, there is no answer to that, it is evil to punish people for their ancestors mistakes. If it's all some plan to come out on the other side better why not remove the suffering portion? Unless you're going to keep worrying about sinning in heaven why not remove the craving of sin using his perfect power?

2. So in a plan he created he prematurely punishes people for possible future transgressions he can change, help, alter etc. To just catch them with suffering early? That's akin to a trap from the movie saw.

3. Someone saying ""I did it for jesus"" is no different than ""I did it for mario"". Mario isn't made manifest as a diety because of that.",t3_12yndwa,1682475479.0,1
20288,jhqme3i,t1_jhqhv0p,"1.) Should I accuse you of letting children starve because you have disposable money right now and you haven't sent your last dime to feed a starving child? Of course not. God allows mankind to suffer the consequences of our choices, collectively and individually. As I said before, God can't remove suffering without removing sin and sinners. One day he will do that, but until then he's being perfect. There will be no sin in the eternal kingdom of God because those that live there will have chosen to be a part of that kingdom and there will be no more temptation or desire to sin. But if God had created a scenario from the beginning where there were no options or choice, then we would have simply been robots.

2.) I'm going to say it again, but suffering in general is not a specific punishment for a specific sin, but rather the general consequence or result of sin in the world. And we are all participants of the sin in this world by birth and by choice.

3.) I don't know about anyone who's life was changed by Mario, or who was healed of an incurable disease by Mario, or who was raised from the dead by Mario. If you showed me something like that, than I would agree that Mario has supernatural power.",t3_12yndwa,1682477659.0,1

You don't believe in God yet claim that if there was a God he would be the active and liable cause of evil and suffering.  I believe in God and affirm that evil, pain and suffering are the opposites of his nature and character and that these things only exist in this world because man has rejected God.

I didn't say that I have cured people (although I have seen several miraculous healings in response to my prayer of faith in Jesus name). I'm saying I have credible proof and testimony from people who have witnessed these things.  If you don't want to see the evidence,  that's fine,  but don't say it's not there.

So I leave you friend with these things. I know Jesus, not just because of what I've read or heard,  but also because of what I've experienced.  I love him and I pray that you can also find love and peace in him.

20291,jhsfk7n,t1_jhrphgb,"I'm glad you can fool yourself, but you have no valid proof or you'd be doing exactly what I'm saying, showing that he is loving and intervening.

You can believe he's not but when his own stories paint him as either evil, incompetent, or at best completely neglectful your belief means absolutely nothing, the same as santa.

There's too many contradictory tales and I'm glad the stories make you a better person but in the end, they're stories. It's okay to be afraid of what's after and seek solace in cavemen imaginary friends but don't claim you have proof, if you did don't share it on reddit, go to the news.",t3_12yndwa,1682519610.0,1

20602,iwfqozw,t3_yvdlow,"There are still two gaps in Nasdaq futures about 10% higher from here. Futures don’t leave open gaps. 

Everyone has been shorting and buying puts most of the year which has only increased during every move higher. IMO there is still too much money riding on capitulation in short term. 

Companies have been saying in their earning calls that supply constraints from China have been hurting them - this has already been priced and we all saw good chunk of selling because of it.

Now, China has begun easing Covid restrictions (bullish) and the rhetoric after Biden/Xi meeting was positive (bullish).

We have to wait until mid December for the next rate hike and FOMC projections. That’s a long time for this market to rally during the seasonal “Santa clause rally.” 

Also, the historical trend of market rallies after midterms! 

That’s said, i think this bear market still has A LOT more downside - below the Covid crash low is where we’re headed. BUT, there is too much money betting on more downside and too many recent bullish events  giving markets a reason to rally higher from here in the short term. 

Don’t get greedy and overconfident so soon. Just because you made a killing on a good trade doesn’t mean you now understand the game. Of course this isn’t something someone in your position wants to hear or even consider, though. 

This plagues the institutional trading environment as well to the point that firms often Force their most successful traders to take a paid break with benefits after a big win.

However, do not suspect that these gaps must be filled NOW during this current bull run in a bear market. I’m simply offering this evidence in support of recent trends giving strength to a short term bull run.

Unemployment being very low usually always precedes recessions and crashes, and our unemployment is very low and layoffs are accelerating already

Accelerating poverty and homelessness

137% debt to gdp

Not a big enough budget deficit

I can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on, I've been autistically and obsessing tracking this for over a year, I picked the top the week of the top

I'm not guessing, I'm not randomly yoloing, and I won't be wrong

Bottoms never form ever unless rate hikes are lowered to near where they started, and bottoms never form when the yield curve is inverted, so this is not the bottom, we're going lower. Disliking me because you think I'm arrogant will not make me wrong.",t3_yvdlow,1668496333.0,1

I'm responding to your incorrect statement, not OPs. Buuuut

The bottom line is ChatGPT can make code out of basically anything you ask. Will it work? Sometimes. Will it be well made? Doesn't matter. The answer is that right now it can solve some small problems and someday it will solve big problems with the help of a skilled coder that knows what to ask for. Unless you are asking the bot to do something illegal or against it's TOS. I think it's fair to say it will take a crack at it.

Why are there so many AI/ChatGPT ""experts"" who don't understand what they're talking about?

I'm going to assume you are not a SWE and you do not understand how ChatGPT functions. From your profile, it appears that you're a truck driver. ChatGPT does not have the ability to create original code. It writes code based on training data. Ask it yourself. Here is the response,



> ChatGPT is a language model that can generate text based on the examples it has been trained on and the context provided by the input. While it can generate code snippets, it does not have the ability to create original code or understand the logic or meaning behind the code it generates. It can only generate code based on patterns and examples it has seen during its training. It is not capable of understanding the purpose or function of the code it generates, or how it might be used in a larger program.

Can you understand some of its limitations now?

> Yes it is. You know it is.

It is not. I know it is not. 

> You even said it is.

I never said that. 

> You said it can't make source code then later say welllll it's context dependant.

I said ChatGPT is not able to successfully translate **""any idea""** into source code. It has complexity limits and it cannot generate original code. Even at lower complexity levels, it routinely generates non-functional code. 

> I'm responding to your incorrect statement

I didn't make an incorrect statement.

> The bottom line is ChatGPT can make code out of basically anything you ask. Will it work? Sometimes. Will it be well made? Doesn't matter.

lol? Non-functional code is useless. Whether or not it's well made absolutely matters. Am I being punkd here?

> The answer is that right now it can solve some small problems and someday it will solve big problems

Exactly! There are problems it cannot solve, thus confirming that it cannot produce code for **any idea**. Self aware much?

> You can even ask it ridiculous things like create an instagram clone and it will give you the steps to do it and help you along the way.

Oh look a pretentious dev. Never seen one of those before. I'm shocked I tell ya. Never in my life have I ever ran into a dev like this. You are so unique! Not common at all in the field!

Never said it didn't have limitations. You are just building a straw man to attack.

> It has complexity limits and it cannot generate original code.

Yes, this ALL would be covered under the part of my response that said it could make source code that might not work or not be of good quality. So I still stand correct and you are just moving the goal post.

> lol? Non-functional code is useless.

The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

> thus confirming that it cannot produce code for any idea.

#Wrong again. It can produce code. The quality and function of that code is up to the person to determine.

20877,j52u6wx,t1_j52r9ni,"> Oh look a pretentious dev.

I don't see anyone behaving pretentiously. I stated this because your comments reflect that you do not understand how ChatGPT functions, and your history indicates that you're a truck driver. I do so cautiously, since assuming is a bad habit. 

Why are you writing so confidently about something you so clearly do not understand? You don't find that odd?

> Never said it didn't have limitations. You are just building a straw man to attack.

This doesn't make sense. Are you aware of the original statement that we're discussing? OP claimed that ChatGPT can successfully write code for **any** idea/application. 

> Yes, this ALL would be covered under the part of my response that said it could make source code that might not work or not be of good quality. So I still stand correct and you are just moving the goal post.

Mate, this is a really dumb comment. If the code does not work, than it's not ""successful"" and the code is useless. My infant daughter can write code that doesn’t work too! There are no goalposts being moved. No need for silly idioms. 

> The discussion isn't about quality of code. It's whether or not it could write source code. It can, so you are wrong. It's quality is irrelevant and it is just an iteration. Future versions will be even more powerful especially with the feedback and popularity it has gained.

Okay, clearly you have no idea what the topic is. No one has questioned whether ChatGPT can produce **any** code. OP suggested that it can code **ANYTHING**, which is false. You can ask ChatGPT this yourself. I posted the response, which you somehow managed to entirely avoid.

> You can dance around this 100 times and 100 times you will still be wrong. It CAN produce source code. You are wrong.

No one said ChatGPT cannot produce code. Are you high as fuck or something? You don't seem to be aware of what we're talking about. 

I tried helping, but I'm no match for this level of stupidity. Cheers, mate!",t3_10g7orf,1674174413.0,12

21049,j1h0dd5,t3_ztoj34,"AAPL is holding because of many reasons. Here are some random ones I can think of:

1. Their physical goods and raw materials literally have intrinsic value (like gold etc). When war broke out, ppl in affected countries bought apple products hoping to resell later in a bid to retain their falling currency value. Countries less affected by world economy are still consuming apple products.

2. Their revenue is diversified across hardware, software and services. (Unlike Meta and Google that are heavily reliant on only ad revenue as their main income source).

3. They don’t spend money recklessly, or yolo into something just because hype (eg. Metaverse), but focus on their fundamentals in delivering quality products.

4. As a result are actually profitable unlike the other big tech. Look at their quarterly reports, still posting profits despite interest rates hike and supply issues, showing resilience year after year.

5. Apple has resources to buyback heavily if it falls more, heck, institutions and investors will probably buy them back before letting it fall further.

Now, it’s a multi-trillion dollar company with several MOATs, huge cash reserves on hand, possibly the best, most efficient manufacturing and logistics scaling in the world, and a competent numbers guy as CEO.

Too many new traders who only know the bubble as their baseline.

To strengthen their balance sheet again, Apple would need to reduce or pause their buyback (with share prices lower than their last purchases). That would raise questions about management as well as take $90-100B a year in buying pressure away. If you want to see how crazy Apple’s financial engineering has been, go look at their equity (book) value since 2018. It’s been in decline.

21238,jgg9u58,t3_12numt7,"Sadly, I think we're going to go in the opposite way, but not for the reasons of being bullish or a yolo'ing regard. We are going to see a correction for the next mini financial instability crisis, but then SPX/QQQ's will go crazily stupidly high. Because my prediction is that what we're going to experience is a currency crisis and inflation will go out of control. Why? 

For starters everyone in this day and age have so much access to information, that in some ways it's hard to get into a recession/selloff. So what we would need is a black swan event in order to trigger a true sell off? And even if we get one look at the recent regional bank crisis, Dowjones went down 1-2%, but Nasdaq and QQQ's went up on a bull run. Why? Because the FED/Treasury/Government bailed out these banks and did every form of communication and signalling to tell everyone don't panic. Institutions can make dumb decisions, but there will be no consequences for them, and even better they will bail em out with your tax payers money. 

The FED/Treasury claims that the FDIC will cover both uninsured and insured deposits at SVB/Signature and potentially other banks, with the added bonus that it'll cost nothing to tax payers. Absolute BS, the FDIC before only had 130B+ yet SVB and Signatures alone basically gobbled all of that money. So how are they going to cover others? Well the solution that they came out with is reliable good ol **print more money = QE.** Essentially, with the backstopping they already started QE in some form. And that's having a knock on effect in helping bond markets to price down interest rates starting the recent decline of the USD. 

Through this, other nations are watching and after reviewing it that the US economy isn't strong as it claims it is. In fact the US will print/bail out their bad companies at the expense of money borrowed from others/future self. This have already started to influence foreign nations in starting to hedge and move away from the USD. Countries have already signed deals to start trading with their own currencies instead of the USD. Now don't get me wrong these trade deals are small and aren't substantial enough to trigger a currency crisis. But, remember all it'll take is just one little push and things can snowball downhill rapidly. Just as SVB showed, it began with bad decisions, then one earnings call then a few billions $ withdrawal, then 40b, then 100b. Once it starts, it's hard to stop. And unlike with SVB where the solution was money and you just needed to throw a ton at it. What happens when the very money (solution to financial crisis) becomes the very issue? How do you stop nations from moving away or running away from the USD? Offer higher interest rates? Yeah right with a 31T and growing debt (And Biden's new 7.5T bill proposal (we all know it ain't passing at that price point but u get the message)), no way the US could service interest rate of 5%+ for long term. So what will the FED/Treasury do? If history is any good indicator, they'll try to redirect the blame, state that they can't control inflation or even better for worse they'll claim the solution is to print more money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271). The rest is history as they say and there we go we have a currency crisis. 

Overall, we will see a temporary correction for whatever next mini financial crisis that comes up next, but the FED/Treasury will overreact and go full on **QE**. Thereby, devaluing the USD, triggering other nations to minimize their holdings of USD bonds/treasuries pushing inflation higher. Causing the QQQ/SPX to go up, not because there is good news, but because the real value of the dollar will drop and stock markets are readjusting for the difference in inflation. Need proof? Just look at EU nations  and UK stock index. Some of them have recently hit all times highs, yet these nations are facing fundamental financial instability and higher inflation than the US, so why? Because their currencies have gone down in the last year, and this is evident when you look at a 5 years basis. All of them are down, and the stock markets are just readjusting for the difference of value. So America will also have it's own taste of devaluation, it's just that the FED/Treasury have kicked the can so far and now the can is about to bounce back into their face.

**TLDR:** QQQ/SPX will go down at next mini financial crisis sometime this year, but will go to the moon because USD will be devalued by FED/Treasury to save economy from said financial crisis. Foreign nations will sell off USD bond holdings causing inflation to re-surge in the US and more QE will be done to just barely stabilize the economy. So QQQ/SPX goes up not because of good news, but because it's adjusting for inflation.",t3_12numt7,1681624914.0,19

We had bond yields predicting a 6% fed funds rate, then we had a banking collapse and the 10 year at 3.5% all within like 6 weeks! And SPY is sitting at the highest point of the year.

My next pivotal moment is April CPI coming early May. It looks really bad. And I actually see tech earnings in the next few weeks being very bad.

To your second point, I do not think that ""access to information"" is a valid reason for markets being unable to correct themselves. Despite the widely available access to information, there is also a great deal that we don't know. That is why statements from the FED or newly released economic data has an impact on the market.

21278,jgkkeum,t1_jgg9u58,"I agree with others replying to you that we will see a correction and even a potential test of the bottom between 3600-3800 on the SPY.

But I don't agree that we will see a currency collapse because too much of the world economics use USD as their currency even with the UAE in talks with China to use their currency in oil sales with OPEC+ China is so reliant on the USA for trade especially agricultural trade they the USD atleast for right now is safe. China cannot unpeg the USD because push come to shove they have to buy food from us and we will in all likely hood never allow those sales in anything other than USD. 

Having said that every analyst worth their salt right now is saying we are in for a correction but the USA is a service based economy and that said 70% of our economy is service based so it's not by a small margin. We are not seeing that drop off in service based sales yet since we had over a years worth of pent up demand on the market. We are seeing a drop off in mid tier merchandise while weirdly enough higher end consumables have popped just look at LVMH( Louis voutton prob butcherd that) its sales aren't dipping they are growing. So I think that the correction will be very stock specific and not an entire broad based sell off like alot of people expect. 

Just to be clear though I do believe that if the FED comes out next month and says it's pausing we will break overhead resistance and start a bull market.

If the FED says we are gonna do 25 pt hike and then pause for more economic data ect you will see a 3-5% ish sell off and then grind back up to break through. If they do 25pt continuing hikes market is gonna shit the bed and test our lows around 3600. 

Historically an extended bear market normally doesn't shift until after the rate hike cycle is complete.

21303,jgitjdk,t1_jghhsn4,"My bad, I wrote too much and it was like midnight and in the pre-dawn when I wrote this monstrosity. To clarify, the ""access to information"" was meant to say that while yes it alone won't prevent a temporary correction. Due to channel of information being so much more free and accessible in comparison to 2008. Government/FED/Treasury can immediately mediate and get their message across to the markets rapidly. Thereby, calming other sectors that were panicking (Ie: Tech/SPY etc) and stabilize quickly. This prevented a ""**proper correction across all markets""**. As you saw in the recent collapse of regional bank stocks, while financial sector took a beating other sectors such as Nasdaq, technology, commodities etc actually rebounded rapidly after 1 day correction. And went onto a bull market. This was due of course of swift action of bailing out and constant 24/7 communications that they would bail out and stabilize markets no matter what (discount lending windows etc). This was what I was pointing out as a major problem in the inhibition of a proper correction or a correction of 5-10% on a major index. Due to this, all we will see is a short term dip when the next crisis hits. Then when the FED/Treasury goes full QE, because the scale of the crisis we will see markets rally to insane levels not because of the action of the FED saving the markets, rather it's the stimulation of liquidity and free money floating around. Driving the USD lower and markets readjusting prices to account for the drop in USD.",t3_12numt7,1681675420.0,1
21304,jgirxxn,t1_jghan8p,"The debt limit increase or crisis either way will only further contribute to my thesis about the devaluation of the USD in the long run. As more debt increase = harder to service that interest, and if America defaults, you can see interest rates spike and foreign nations panicking to sell off more treasuries. However, I think that a default is unlikely as in the last couple of days, house speaker McCarthy came out and stated he had a plan and would show the full extent of it tomorrow at Wall street. But, he did indicated that his proposal essentially is a raise in the debt ceiling, but spending for essentials medicaid, social security, defence NDS stuffs, would grow at a 1-2% increase per year. 

This shows that at least he isn't trying to drag this out and leave it last second. Now, honestly we know this is 99% likely a political ploy to make it look like they are working on it. But, it will be up to see how the negotiations going forward. Overall, I think the debt limit crisis will be adverted as much as the hawkish republicans are on supposedly lowering debt (they're just transferring spending cuts on green energy initiatives over to defence/fossil fuel initiatives), there's a general election next year. And they can't afford just as much as Democrats any massive political disasters.",t3_12numt7,1681674762.0,3

Especially our EU counterparts in their stocks reaching ath's. I'm doing a mix of precious metals and T-bills. Buying mining stocks/foreign ones too just to help prepare for the scenario where the FED starts printing. While I have risks, I just feel that looking at the current administrations across the world with their reckless spending, war in Ukraine not abating in fact escalating, Saudi's, Brazil, China, African countries looking to trade more with their own currencies.

I do agree with what it sounds like you are saying about the fed rate outlook. There are no cuts coming and inflation is going to take a long time to come down. I just think ""real"" economy stocks are trading like the recession already started.

Credit spreads spiked last year, and they tried to spike when SIVB happened but didn't touch last years levels. Right now credit spreads are coming right back down since SIVB. And at no point in the last 2 years have they gotten even in the same ballpark as past recessions. Credit spreads are big for me as they have predicted things for years up and down long-term.

 Amazon has 20% stake in Rivian and they provide [delivery vehicles ](https://freeimage.host/i/HidTcLx) which have more space than any vans (except step vans) and have heated and cooling seats which is essential with the current extreme heat in troubled states.

21596,jldfoiz,t3_13q16jw,"A bunch of highly regarded people in here that can't read a balance sheet nor a cash flow statement. Forget all that rubbish about software companies having a low book value. Book value is primarily impacted by three things: net income, share issuance, and capital return.

Apple's BVPS keeps falling because of the buyback. 

Just look at their Common Stock line item and their retained earnings. When Apple repurchases shares, that common stock falls by (0.00001 + issuance price) * shares repurchased. The retained earnings falls by the (price paid per share repurchased - issuance price - 0.00001) * shares repurchased. Retained earnings also falls due to Apple's dividend.

Retained earnings = Previous period RE + Net Income - Dividends - Preferred Dividends - Share repurchases. 

Apple does $100 bn in net income, buys back $90 bn in stock, and pays out $15 bn in dividends. If they didn't return capital to shareholders, you would see their book value skyrocket by $100 bn. 

Apple will have a negative book value if they keep returning all cash generated to shareholders.",t3_13q16jw,1684893461.0,8

There's your bull case.  China is the future.  The west is so nonfunctional, particularly the USz that what you are investing in is a financial house of cards.  Real wealth is in material outputs, not interest rates.

Most of the people in the world under 35 see the US as the greatest threat to their future.  There's no leadership coming from us anymore.  People will do business with the US only if they have to, but they will willingly and gladly do business with China.

I personally see the US as something of a lame duck.  Tipping points are coming and when they come, they will trigger cascading failures throughout the US system.

All the cold war bullshit from CHIPS to COMPETES to strong arming Europe to follow suit, to tariffs, to sanctions, to that fucking ballon nonsense have created a situation that has put the US in a very precarious position and they're kinda shitting their pants, which is why they're trying to walk all of it back the last week.

Concrete 'ghost towns' make China's real estate bubble visible

Land prices over twice those in U.S.; many trapped in unfinished homes

Nikkei staff writers
FEBRUARY 9, 2022 14:02 JST

SHANGHAI/GUANGZHOU/TOKYO -- A popping sound, not unlike the finale of a fireworks show, echoed through the area, and a cloud of dust billowed up into the air. In late August 2021, 14 unfinished apartment buildings were demolished in Kunming, Yunnan Province.

The developer had run into financial difficulties and abandoned construction. After the buildings went unattended for seven years, it was decided that they should be demolished out of safety concerns. In less than a minute, they collapsed into piles of rubble. It was an unsatisfying end for the massive project.

China's real estate market has been rocked by the kind of problems facing China Evergrande Group. President Xi Jinping, who has hailed the nation internationally as ""Great China,"" is slowly and quietly starting to act in order to save face. One of the main tasks is dealing with the empty developments known as ""ghost towns.""

But some worry that these developments are just the tip of the iceberg. Data clearly show anomalies in the Chinese real estate market.",t3_13q16jw,1684947256.0,0
21726,jlglkl3,t1_jlg4q3b,"Lol.  Ghost cities have long been debunked since they were completely misunderstood a decade ago.  Since then, none of the reported ghost cities have remained empty, though new developments are still being built prior to being occupied.  

There's this thing called ""planning"".  In this case, China builds developments for huge numbers of people and doesn't move anybody in until the construction is completed.  This allows them to set and enforce standards for power, communications and other utilities so that those things aren't being slap-dashed together later.  It's cleaner, less risky and more efficient.  If you've ever been anywhere in Thailand, you would see exactly the problem with not planning anytime you look at any utility pole in the whole fucking country.  It's a nightmare.

My job in the US is to literally go around the country and unfuck the utility issues that have sprung up around not properly planning communities.  The US power grid is plagued with radial lines and all manner of line tapped distribution networks that can't sectionalize at all.  Chinese developments are avoiding all of these issues and many others including insufficient sewer systems, water systems, drainage, grading, and so on.

You are just repeating bullshit that has long been debunked.  And the article you quoted makes not only the same mistake, but commits a new one.

14 buildings in an already established tier 2 (read: major) city in China is not and could not be a ""ghost city"".  It's a development within an already existing major city.  You, as a clearly overly sinophobic westerner who'll buy anything negative about China, grab the phrase ""ghost city"" and run with it, because confirmation bias.  

On to the meat of it, this development ran out of money a decade ago.  It has sat unfinished at some intermediate phase of construction for 10 years.  It's a safety hazard.  Nobody has come along to finish it and the company that started it was unable to get the capital required to complete the work.  The decision to demolish it was made lucidly and with the laudable reason of public safety.  Why you can't accept that and instead need to fabricate some bullshit that they are padding GDP is fucking ridiculous and someone needs to say that to you.  China doesn't need to pad its GDP.  It's already accepted by every economist in the world as the greatest economic miracle in the history of mankind.  But your position is that somehow, 14 decade old buildings in Kunming are the proof of some widespread conspiracy.  K.

Chin enjoys a nearly 900 billion dollar per year trade surplus.  They have the most modern cities in the world.  They have the largest educated population in the world and graduate an educated workforce equal to the entire US educated workforce every 4 years.  They lead in 37 of 44 critical emerging technologies.  They have so much pull around the world that even the mighty US cannot do anything but talk shit and then walk it back.  Even as China puts together a system that undermines the hegemony of the dollar, the US must sit back and let it happen, because real economic power resides in the east now.  Get used to it.  Or, you know, keep repeating nonsense and aggressively pretend it isn't happening and be wildly surprised by it later.  I really don't care.",t3_13q16jw,1684953472.0,0

Again, the morning gap level, that is the previous day's closing price is a magnet in general. Now if a stock gaps 5% or higher in one day, the likelihood of backfilling it becomes statistically less likely, so I'm looking for gaps that are between 1-2% in size, maybe 3% and plan for a 5 DTE.",t3_zz2wqk,1672421916.0,3

What I found worth sharing was the concept of Apple via Apple Pay and Apple Cards mixing rewards systems and banking with above par APR/APY. This could get a freak flood  from crap banks and unbanked into iphone as a bank. Making overnight, Apple one of the biggest most integrated and well accepted fintech payments processor.

that is some heavy stuff looking long from here, not to be overhype, but it could be a 2-7yr multiX price vs share with forward splits expected, potential spinoff and massive uptick in cash volume plus user/fee base. It's crazy enough for a movie plot.

IRL, I use android because I don't like having a phone master i have to pay for my own shit. Trade wise, fk it, near term volatility is profit, and obvious growth long is easy value.

\*\*edit, derped out and forgot extended context

Goldman Sachs is doing the banking for Apple, Goldman just announced step back from retail/consumer banking. It is almost conspiracy good timing for the perfect bridge to shadow bank it. Which could lead to customer and holdings increase beyond the massive volume and fees implied on all sides.

Interesting. I'm long term bullish and think the move from 120 to 150 will happen basically overnight. Short term, seems a little over extended and based on last 3 earnings calls I'm reluctant to gamble on this one. But I hope you're right and wish to see massive gains.

21900,j6g1cpf,t1_j6g0guc,"Thanks man ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270) I do think we fill the $110 gap either going into earnings or after. I entered around 99.80ish after noticing a textbook cup and handle breakout, as well as an inverse H&S forming. As for the report I of course have no clue what to expect, I don’t like holding through any earnings as their all gambles so I’m hoping we see a run up into earnings to sell beforehand.

First Take advantage of opening up a capital one high yield savings account (3.99 APY) literally put all of this in there and do not fucking touch it. Let the compounding do it’s work.. YES ITS FUCKING SLOW. But if you still want to “gamble” this is how you can do it..

IF AND ONLY “IF” Youre a salary employee, modify your sales tax exemption to “all taxes to be withheld from state and federal” 

You then open up ANOTHER savings account and modify your check distribution since you can see EXACTLY what would be taken out to pay taxes since the amount never changes, YOU then allocate that number as a direct deposit (

(Example you make 2000 last paycheck, 100, federal 100 state taxes, the 200 dollars would go into your second savings account, which will ALSO COLLECT COMPOUNDING INTEREST) 

At the end of the year you PAY the taxes you withheld BUT with compounding interest you will pay back the government and POCKET the different even if you didn’t do a single day trade all year.

You then have two savings accounts collecting interest and you can still gamble with one of the accounts but KNOW you OWE the taxes at the end of the year so don’t GAMBLE what you can’t payback.

22312,jnckava,t3_143x2uz,"Thanks for sharing, agree with some points but definitely disagree with your idea of watching Bloomberg and CNBC all day. They are rarely on the side of retails best interest and are puppets to the controlling powers to play a fear game on retail investors and traders to get in and out of their positions at the worst of times. 

I'm sure you reflect back and wish you took the advice I'm about to give everyone on here.

Invest, put your money in a basket of stocks/etf's all in and never look back, only down the road after 10 plus years. People who truly invest in stocks get rewarded.

Every seasoned investor/trader can tell you a story how they had a plethora of stocks at very low prices but decided to sell after holding for small gains either because of fear or felt like they needed to cash in some meesley gains. 

How many of you at one time have owned shares of Tesla, apple, Kla, ASML, enphase, applied materials, Facebook, google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, amd, nvda at infintile stages in their stock price lives and say to yourself ""only if I would have held for 10 years""

People who invest in America long term get rewarded, more times then not 

That is the best advice you will ever get .

And, racial bigotry. Just because the Civil Rights Act past the year I was born didn’t mean everything was suddenly different. 

Shit. How naive to you have to be to think I could see the impact on my Depression Era parents, English second language, no education, struggling. 

I lived through 12% interest. I effing bought my second vehicle at a 14.5 handle. 

You don’t have to be a adult to experience life. Our children don’t remember 9/11, but they remember 2008z

They lived through that. 

I grew up in a military town next to Fort Hood. Google Peeples Elementary on Google Maps. 

See that giant 1st Cav heliport literally across from my elementary school. I experienced Vietnam as well. 

Kids getting called out of class when shit happened. Jane Fonda coming to town. Jimmy Carter came to town. 

We didn’t hang out on SnapChat and Tinder all day. Only three channels. We rode bikes behind the mosquito trucks. Didn’t wear seat belts and watched Vietnam and the Middle East conflicts live everyday at 6:00 PM.

You can take my opinion or leave it. I’m just telling you ancestors leave Tsunami Stones for their grandchildren because they have learned the lesson.

Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. 

Hard times are coming. That’s why so said to keep an eye on what is going on. If a serious melt up occurs with retail replacing smart money at the top, you can find opportunities in the predictable chaos. 

I wouldn’t recommend heavy margin plays, but you do you.  

I moved our retirement funds into bonds just before the close today. 

There is like a 65% of a steep sell off in the next 9 weeks. 

But, if that doesn’t happen and instead it really heats up, I think the odds of a strong correction with a negative bias for months to replace the bulk market. 

It’s just my opinion. You have yours and I have mine. I found the C19 play on Reddit and got out and in close to peak and bottom. I also shorted and made so shekels, but left 80% of the potential gains on the table by taking profits too soon.

I see an entirely different opportunity now and came to test the thesis. I am generally a market contrarian, but I honestly don’t know what to make of the WSB sentiment.

In a nutshell, this is the chaos I see:

https://www.thehistoryville.com/mansa-musa-richest-man-history/

It’s a great story. Printer goes brrrrrrrrr? Eventually, the bar tab comes due and it will be paid by someone to someone. 

I want to be the payee, not the payer. I am too old to hold through an extended period of negative returns. 

Life and Opportunity can be charted against one another with (life) options on the Y-axis and t (time) charted on the X-axis. 

I can’t see a reference to it on a Google search, but I studied it in my 20’s just out of B-school. It was by Boston Consulting Group and I haven’t forgotten the lesson. 

My t (time) is limited, ergo, so are my own (life) options because life options decline over time. 

If you didn’t put in the effort earlier, it is unlikely you can shift gears and become a doctor at 40 and get your entire investment in a medical doctor’s license.

The inverse is true. Zoom out just a little bit and think about how to squeeze bank out of the inverse. 

I am basically telegraphing my play here. If a true melt up occurs, then I will no doubt hear Alan Greenspan whispering in my ear, “irrational exuberance”.

How old were you when the Dot Com Bubble burst?

Do you know what market euphoria looks like or sounds like? It sounds like “stonks only go up” and “printer goes brrrrrr”.  

In the last days, it will sound like, “Hey, I feel like I I missing out, I want to put all my money in the printer”.

I just wanted to get a sense for the latter. 

Either you’re going to take my money or I am going to take yours. 

Tell you what. When I reenter the market, we can whip them out and see whose is bigger. 

Peace and good luck.

We came from the bottom, poverty-stricken scene,
Gas mines and food stamps, that's where we'd been.
Foosball became my hustle, playing for a meal,
In this game of survival, we had to keep it real.

Graduated '87, finance was my decree,
Dreaming of a better life, that's what I aimed to see.
But the S&L Crisis hit, it all came crashing down,
The struggles of the past, still haunting every town.

(Chorus)
History may not repeat, but it sure does rhyme,
Know your roots, know the struggle, take your time.
In the pages of our past, lessons intertwine,
Know your history, know your future, that's the line.

(Verse 2)
Jimmy Carter's malaise, a nation feeling low,
Economic hardships, despair started to grow.
But through it all, we held our heads up high,
Resilience in our hearts, aiming for the sky.

Learn from those who came before, their battles fought,
The triumphs and the setbacks, the lessons they taught.
From the struggles of poverty to the heights we'll ascend,
Outkast-style, breaking barriers, we won't ever bend.

(Chorus)
History may not repeat, but it sure does rhyme,
Know your roots, know the struggle, take your time.
In the pages of our past, lessons intertwine,
Know your history, know your future, that's the line.

(Bridge)
The pain and the hunger, the drive to succeed,
In the face of adversity, planting a seed.
Poverty can't define us, we rise above,
Outkast mentality, spreading love.

(Verse 3)
Our rap tells a story, a testament to the grind,
Turning obstacles to stepping stones, leaving them behind.
Through the struggles of poverty, we found our way,
Crafting rhymes and beats, our voices here to stay.

From gas mines to finance, our journey is diverse,
The knowledge of the past, in every single verse.
So remember where you come from, embrace your history,
Know your roots, know your future, that's the key.

(Chorus)
History may not repeat, but it sure does rhyme,
Know your roots, know the struggle, take your time.
In the pages of our past, lessons intertwine,
Know your history, know your future, that's the line.

(Outro)
Outkast-style, we break the chains of poverty,
Using music as our tool, we set ourselves free.
Know your history, embrace the pain and the strife,
For in the face of adversity, we'll thrive.",t3_143x2uz,1686399285.0,1

They were Dave Ramsey up their junior year. All under 30. Two have homes. All have retirement funds. None has ever asked us for money. That’s been my real investment.

I’ve passed on a roadmap for Boggle-Ramsey life with a set aside for speculative fun. Like masturbation. It’s an automatic low dollar monthly transfer from the their paychecks for play.

>TL;DR: Banks are screwed, and it might be a good idea to go to cash now before things really start to unravel.",t3_11o5jer,1678493880.0,1
22430,jbqy1xh,t3_11o5jer,The big fallacy in your argument is that you fail to mention that banks are not expected to mark to market their losses on bonds. So the risk of sweeping default exists only if the banks have more unrealized losses then their equity and a bank run happens like it did for svb. Also for svb unrealized losses were almost 100% of their equity. This isn't the case for most other US banks.,t3_11o5jer,1678495694.0,15
22431,jbquywt,t3_11o5jer,"The funny thing about the SVB failure is that they themselves did nothing wrong; in fact they were extremely conservative with their financial practices. The problem is so inherent in the banking system we have today and the monetary policy of the fed that this could’ve happened to any bank. I predict it will start with the regional banks which will start failing one by one, and gradually spread panic into the market causing bank runs. Just my two cents",t3_11o5jer,1678494253.0,41

This is a place where our rates of cancer and autism skyrocket every year and we don’t fuxking question the commie pricks who say we’re using too many antibiotics in the meat, we just find a start up pharma bro company to solve the fuxking problem.

22439,jbqyo6t,t3_11o5jer,"The failure of SVB has nothing at all to do with economic stimulus. It was driven by bad investments in crypto, high deposits, and the recent increase in interest rates and the fact that SVB was long in bonds at lower rates because they couldn’t invest their deposits fast enough.",t3_11o5jer,1678495983.0,4
22440,jbrgbe1,t3_11o5jer,Funny I thing is this reminds me of exactly when ANB collapsed which had $2.1 billion back in 2008 for those of us old enough to remember. Honestly it’s about freaking time we need a reset just like 2001 & 2008.,t3_11o5jer,1678504654.0,3

This crash could take a few quarters to play out even if everyone knows it will hit in the end.

Fed might slow down interest rate increases and live with higher inflation for a while.

It also takes companies a long time to go under even if they are at a loss for a year.

The key to both was money was seemingly created for some people. I'm not a financial guy but a retired engineer. Do you think the default rates on credit cards and the importance of crypto taking a large gain and the a large loss in recent years could be behind this issue now with the banks?

Palantir may be a lot of things, but in the middle of those things it's easy to forget that they are literally a CIA financed analytics company that have been using and tuning AI since before ChatGPT knew how to peel a potato. 

Based on an almost entire lack of information, but with a license to speculate wildly; it wouldn't surprise me if Palantir is one of very few real early winners on the advancement and adoption of AI.

It's getting harder and harder to find decent low wage employees. This leads to customers' shopping experiences getting progressively worse.

I believe this factor does actually have something to do with DG and DLTR eating shit, as shopping at either of those stores is getting to be more frustration then the savings are worth.

I do believe that the crisis in this area is only just beginning.

1. Boomers (angry or not) are the only ones with any money
2. TGT is a higher price point than WMT and is more susceptible to pullbacks
3. TGT does not have enough of a non-discretionary product mix (primarily groceries, which WMT does) to sustain profits.

The reason consumer stocks have been mooning is because their revenues and profits are up. But anyone nitwit could tell you that if you raise the price on every food product by 20%, you will obviously see an increase in revenue. You can't do the same thing with shoes, clothing, cosmetics, etc. People don't truly NEED those things. But without food, most people are prone to death.

**FOUR**: The BIG ONE: When student loans resume, everyone, including TGT consumers are going to get fucking hammered.

Those are a few quick items I could think of. I think the biggest, most overlooked (by some) issue at play is student loans.

If you are trying to time the so-called stock meltdown, it's easy:

Take the day student loan payments resume, add 60-90 days for it to be reflected in decreased corporations' revenue = and there's your market nosedive.

22963,jor2jsl,t1_joqslrf,"There are two major problems that basically take down their argument:

1. The idea that rising prices in discretionary goods automatically constrain the market comes from research done during flat money supply periods. In that case, yes, the fraction of goods available to the market for revenue will drop (according to classical economics, we'll get to why that's a problem in a second). When you have elevating wages and increased money supply and more money circulating in the economy to encompass the increased pricing with enough margin, the real difference in sales volume is either reduced or negated. In other words, if prices go up 20% in 3 years, but combined wages have increased almost as much, you have to account for the greater amount of money chasing goods. It's basically mathematical reduction.
2. The student loan thesis in their argument is a red flag.

The common claim is that Americans spend about $200B/year on student loan payments.

That's a lot, right? That's a big number. That's a big scary fucking number. That's bigger than more money I'll ever see. It's definitely more than others on here who think this is a really big scary number will ever see, and I'll probably see 2-3, maybe 50x the amount of money they'll see in their lifetimes.

Yeah, that number really scares me. Very scary.

Now go and look up total consumer spending in the country... and it's... it's... on trend to be more than $60T this year...

In other words, $200B of lost capital velocity, which you were just told would bring retail establishments to its knees causing a black swan event... **amounts to a grand total of 0.33% of on-trend consumer spending**...

WOMP WOMP

Honestly, that number is probably a little bit of an overestimate on payments, too... but we'll accept that it's probably somewhere in the ballpark.

Now I don't want to play down a reduction of capital velocity from payments, it's important to note that the human impact does scale out and cause other issues, but the economy was growing just fine with people paying student loans at the same rate prior to the pandemic, so there's little reason to think that student loan payments returning is a massive net negative against the market unless you're trading in classical economics and not considering the expansion of wages and money supply as an offset.

I bring up classical economics because what people are falling victim to here is a flaw in econ 101 classes that comes from classical economics which uses an overly simplistic Supply and Demand model for flexing in goods and services which does not actually prove out in real world economic research. People assume that there's a linear and universal relationship to discretionary purchases when the consumer belt tightens, but that's not happens. What happens is that consumers debt spend and/or shift in other areas, and they shift unpredictably, if at all, and over unpredictable periods.

If you get extremes in earnings potential, like you did in the period between 1990-2008 during the housing boom while most people were seeing real wages decline not just a little bit, but entire blue collar career lines being obliterated in that period, then you can expect massive reductions in volume.

But wages are higher. Many of the jobs that reshored into the United States during the pandemic are higher income careers, like the return of manufacturing. Inflation is relatively high, but over the entire term manageable (with the exception of Housing, I hope, but that's a whole different discussion). Basically, there's significant reason to doubt the ""OMG, consumers won't buy discretionary items with inflation like this!"" narrative.

That same narrative failed to produce an earnings recession now for going on 6 quarters... and in fact, the same people selling that narrative said we were in a recession now about 5 quarters ago.

Those same people are the same ones saying that debt ceilings crash markets and one month ago were predicting that bond liquidity was going to cause the market to come crashing down as the treasury panic-sold bonds to rehydrate the general fund. It was the SAME. EXACT. ARGUMENT. too... ""OMG, they're going to have to release TRILLIONS in bonds over months! That's so much!"" then when you divide it down it's, again, noise...

Noticing a pattern? Bad economics, big number fear, black swan scenarios...

The big threat is actually from the banks, and potential downstream issues from tightening, but even that narrative is getting old at this point because of Fed actions. But ""OMG big numbers!"" scenarios should be a big red flag for anyone, because the economy itself is MASSIVE, so any theory which is about ""this FEELS really big"" should be skeptically doubted.

Edit: Now, I want to be clear that I'm not necessarily saying that TGT goes up from here... I think there are other forces at play relating to all of retail which others have cited here, and those are fine... I just think these two arguments are not that great on their own.",t3_14dlipt,1687208285.0,13

>  
>BIG difference.

I'm not confusing anything. I get where you're coming from, but it's a different argument than the one talking about regarding the macro impact of the costs.

The discussion on $200B of lost consumer spending is, in this context, really an argument about the net impact of overall economic activity on macro earnings, so we have to consider like-for-like magnitude aspects of this spending, and that means we need to look at it first as a function of total spend. In other words, we need to understand the scope of a macro change within the impact to the macro overall spend to understand how it works systemically.

It's fair to go down the next layer which is to take it from macro to micro, which is what you're doing here, but that gets really fraught really quickly.

I'm gonna play multiple angles of this out to demonstrate.

For instance, OK, let's say these figures include $100k cars... and your argument would be that the added burden of an extra payment might dissuade someone from buying a $100k car due to the added cost.

The problem is that even without paying student loans, the vast majority of the 43 million people\* with student loans aren't buying $100k cars. In fact, for most of them a big ticket item like that is very, very rare... and the smaller ticket items that you find at target may be marginally impacted by a student loan payment to some extent, but then you have to deal with the fact that prices for those items will either come down, or the supply for those items will come down, ultimately resulting in either greater volume or greater margin.

Basically, the low impact to overall net buying potential here significantly softens the micro impact on the macro outcome.

Now am I suggesting that people who earn more will just buy more stuff? No, individuals only need just so much of any given thing. It's not that simple, but at the same time it's not so simple as a simplistic flex of ""more obligation means less spending.""

Now maybe your angle is that big ticket items being in that spending figure means the impact of the expansion of monthly obligation increases the impact to money that can go to target because it has a greater impact on the populations that shop at target, meaning that the relatively greater impact to cash flow expands the losses at target.

The problem here is that of the 330m people in the United States, only 13% actually hold Federal student loans. Of those, only 25% are paying at the standard rate. The rest are all on programs that reduce their payments based on earnings.

The other thing to note is that half the borrowers, holding over 60% of the debt, are in the 35-61 age bracket, or ideal earning period. This bracket also has the greatest access to credit, as well.

The take-away from all of this is not only is a small slice of overall spend, it's a narrow slice of the population, and the most affected people weighting the average monthly cost to the $300-600 range for average payment are also the people most capable of absorbing the cost and least likely to have their spending habits impacted by the obligation.

Most of the people most sensitive to these changes are either deferred or weighted below the average range because of income reductions.

It's not that there's no potential impact from that, it's that people suggesting this is a retail apocalypse or a market event on its own are VASTLY overstating the impact of this.

**---------- If you ask yourself no other question, ask yourself this: Was the economy capable of growth and were margins fine with these payments being made when incomes were dramatically lower and unemployment higher prior to the pandemic?**

Yes, yes it was. This is not the great strain on spending and liquidity that people think it is. It's not immaterial to individuals. I'd like to see something done to reduce the burden, but it's also not a black swan event.

Now I do think we will see an impact from credit tightening and the Fed's actions down the road, so I do expect a pullback, but the evidence that it will significantly come from student loan payment starts is possibly the thinnest soup of them all. Not that it will stop people from claiming that it was student loan payments if credit tightening impacts spending... but credit tightening is unquestionably the superior force. (Having said that, I also think people are likely overestimating the impact of that as well unless there's a major banking crisis that simply goes without any reaction... which is unlikely at this point.)

I'm just saying it's probably not a great bet to expect a big impact from student loan payments restarting.

You didn't lose today! 

If we get hung up on what could have been, we'll hold future trades too long and let them turn red. How often do you go back at the end of the day and look at options you won on that end the day at zero? You still won dude! You now have more money today than you did yesterday.

There’s a few facets to my trade and I could go into fundamentals but really it’s just a valuation/technical play. AAPL is hitting trend line resistance, while also struggling once again to break $156 which seems like an established top for the stock at this point. Based on trend line, the next low should be around $120 which I anticipate could take a couple months. I could have gotten shorted dated options but also don’t want to be screwed if Apple trades sideways for a couple weeks. Valuation wise, look at nearly any megacap tech stock and they’re significantly of their highs. AAPL still is within a 10% range from their ATH despite recession and consumer electronic demand warnings. The only thing I’ll say from the fundamental side is that the stock is trading on unrealistic expectations and the Street does not fully take into account the Covid pull-forward for consumer electronics, limited opportunity in services, and a what I believe to be a weaker than expected year (2H) for consumers overall.",t3_11vukdf,1679254052.0,11

24331,it4dglo,t3_y96ywv,"I'd adjust all the numbers to account for the piles of cash you'd also be buying, kind of cash-back rebate on your $2.3T purchase. Too lazy to look at balance sheet to subtract assets from liabilities.. but I'm pretty sure it's positive. Plus, isn't it possible they borrowed a fuck ton of money at low rates and can now just themselves buy treasury bills to make money off of the borrowed money?

On the scale of things, won't matter much to your argument. The real wiggle room is in how far into the future you want to value their growth and prospects.

They have some incredible products and even more incredibly stupid users. I mean.. you can't even add a fucking memory card to their phones, ipads, etc... instead you get reamed to pay more. But.. wow.. there's a ""virtual island"" or whatever. And people are all happy about the fact they offer the higher memory versions, get excited about new colors and increasingly worthless features, etc, etc. Hard to put a number on holding a massively loyal fanbase that throws money at you happily.

But, I agree, I think they're going to take a tumble. Not because investors want to park their money elsewhere (there will always be an appetite for risk, and AAPL represents the best of value AND growth combined).. but because I think consumers will slow their discretionary spending a lot, and that's what the market is going to care about.

24338,it4322e,t3_y96ywv,"Thoughtful post, thank you.

One question, why do you think that it may not “fit (apple’s) fiduciary duty’s to continue to buy back shares given yields currently”??

As in, if I think I follow you, you’re saying:

Apple has $5b in cash it intends to deploy by buying back shares (random number); it would be contrary to the BODs fiduciary duty to approve a stock buyback when it could instead deploy that cash into 5 or 10 year bonds?

Whilst I don’t agree with that notion, that it would violate their fiduciary duty, perhaps they think that it makes sense to do so, both because 
(1) they’re not paying any dividend on the shares they buy back, so that’s ~.65% of $5b in shares they’re not paying dividends on, which by my childish math is around $32m, saved, and 
(2) they think apple will be worth at least 4%+ more in 5 years or whatever length of bond we’re talking about, which isn’t per se crazy to speculate that would be the case.",t3_y96ywv,1666295922.0,5

Finally, a lot of tech companies partake in buybacks to fund stock grants as part of compensation for new hires and refreshes. On the one hand, they'll likely need to issue more shares per employee to match last year's comp (if they choose to do that), they'll also be hiring less. So that's a toss-up.

24479,je8ezao,t1_je80gv4,"Thank you so much, awesome question! It all started when VisualMod made a comment to someone’s DD post and said that Polestar was a great company to invest in, or whatever, so I ended up buying a bunch of shares and [ended up making about a 50% gain on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yud2m4/the_best_stock_picker_out_here_is_visualmod/) After that I began getting rather obsessed with AI because I really wanted to understand it more.   


I eventually saw that in the WSB Discord, there is the AI fun channel where you can talk directly to VisualMod, so after a while I thought it would be funny to record some answers and paint a story, then it evolved into this due to some of the obscure comments that were made.  


I had a whole section on politics that I was going to add, but it was just insane to where it was just a tad… too much. One second praise to Biden and that Trump was a lunatic, then the other was basically the reverse. As you can tell in the biography as it is written now, VisualMod makes several contradicting comments throughout the whole thing. My favorite line is actually this one, *“I am planning on taking care of the homeless situation as well because it seems to be getting out of hand. I believe that everyone deserves a chance to live a comfortable life, and the homeless are not receiving that opportunity. By eradicating them, we can make sure that everyone who is rich has an equal chance to succeed.”* It starts so strong in the first two sentences, then in the last one, it just goes nuts.   


As far as leading questions, sometimes I would ask something, like with *“Unlike poor and homeless people, I don’t think we should eradicate fat people.”* VisualMod actually went on a tangent about fat people previously, then went on about eradicating poor and homeless people, so I asked right after that, do you think we should eradicate fat people, and that’s what you end up with. Basically, what happened is I had several conversations, wrote down every sentence of each one, and tried to arrange them to the best of my ability.  


Othertimes I would ask something, and I would get the same answer a couple times, then randomly I’d get a wildcard. That was difficult. Also sometimes I’d ask something and I’d keep getting the response “I don’t understand” after a while. Hope that answered something!",t3_1266era,1680148748.0,9

If you don’t want to be made fun of for questions like these go to r/stocks. You’ll probably get even more out of your question cause those guys are fuckin nerds. 

The real answer is that was the price range during that interval. The solid part is where the candle opened and closed. The rest is how it fluctuated the rest of the period.

24500,ip6xa1a,t3_xilwbl,"So your asking about wicks.  Very easy, candles all have bodies and most have wicks. Bodies are the full bar of color wether green or red sometimes it’s full bars sometimes it’s small bars and big long wicks. Wicks are also called shadows because of the volatility during the candles trading session there was quick movement say the price on your red candle closed at 29 but during that 1 hour candles time of forming the price had quickly dropped to say 26 and then shot back up to $30 in minutes then it closed at 29 sometime later and the price didn’t move fast just gradually creating the full body. Wicks are basically what creates the high and low of the candle. It helps set a range of what did that candle do and when you learn candle patterns you can use that technical analysis to set up high probability trades for yourself",t3_xilwbl,1663680742.0,3
24501,ip3xuhy,t3_xilwbl,"The line, aka the wick, both above and below the actual candle shows the range of the price in the corresponding interval. So at the end of the interval the price might be at $35.96 but the actual price went all the way down to $0.035 then came back up.

24504,ip5nhmx,t3_xilwbl,"that’s a SUPER low volume ticker there champ. It will take a while of trading to intuitively understand what is high volume or low volume (or you can multiply the avg price on a candle by the volume to get a more comparable number e.g. dollars per minute).

as a really loose rule, I wouldn’t trade anything that doesn’t have a consistent 150k volume per each 1 min (since you’re looking at a 1 min chart here). The bar you are hovered over has 7.5k volume lol 

you’ll find this out eventually if you keep trading them, but low volume tickers are bad to trade for a few reasons:

* they generally correlate with really crappy companies that could go to zero overnight
* low volume = low liquidity = you can get burned trying to get in and out quickly because the spread will be higher. if you don’t know what you’re doing you can lose a lot very quickly 
* hard to read price action. low volume tickers usually will have pretty lazy price action that makes it hard to really read it’s behavior and make a plan

I would recommend just watching the price action of something that trades on high volume like SPY or TSLA. you’ll find a lot more conviction in the moves, and you’ll learn a lot more by watching that rather than whatever sketchy shit this is haha",t3_xilwbl,1663648209.0,4

>TL;DR: Bears need to close under 408.87 (1H) for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill and under 409.97 to test daily buy-side discounts. Bulls need to close above 415.27 (daily) for a push towards 417.62 and 418.31",t3_13gjfiq,1683989150.0,1

The Empire State manufacturing survey for May will be released at 8:30 am Eastern Time and economists are forecasting a less-than-optimistic result of -5.0. This would be a dramatic shift from the previous 10.8 reading and could signal a change in the manufacturing sector. At 9:15 am Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari will make remarks that are always keenly anticipated by investors and market analysts alike.

24749,jk0eg0o,t1_jk0c2h2,"It's clear that both businesses and households have been experiencing tighter lending standards and weaker demand for various loan categories. Especially noteworthy is the tightening of lending standards across all categories of commercial real estate (CRE) loans and residential real estate (RRE) loans, excluding government-sponsored ones.

Banks cite a less favorable or uncertain economic outlook, reduced risk tolerance, and concerns about collateral values and their own funding and liquidity positions as reasons for these changes. This indicates a climate of caution and potentially anticipates a downturn or at least a slowing of growth.

The expectations for continued tightening across all loan categories for the rest of 2023 are particularly concerning. This is primarily due to the expectation of deteriorating credit quality, reduced risk tolerance, and concerns about funding and liquidity.

Interestingly, the tightening in business loan standards was reported more frequently by mid-sized banks, potentially affecting small and medium enterprises more severely. These banks also expressed more concerns about their liquidity positions, deposit outflows, and funding costs than the largest banks.

Given this backdrop, it's understandable why Goolsbee would express concern about a potential credit crunch.",t3_13gjfiq,1683993205.0,8

24755,jk13civ,t1_jk0eg0o,"In recent years, financial regulation has become more stringent in terms of lending, particularly in terms of lending standards and risk control requirements, which has impacted both businesses and households. Commercial real estate and residential real estate loans are very important loan categories and have been affected as a result. For commercial real estate loans, banks focus more on factors such as the borrower's credit history, type of business, quality of the bank's assets and reliability of collateral, and the same is true for residential real estate loans, however, it should be noted that an exception is government-sponsored loans, where the government usually provides certain policies and support to promote real estate and economic development.",t3_13gjfiq,1684004230.0,4

Apple though? Ehhh... harder to see it. They basically print money and perform well in many different areas. YTD they're down ~20% so it's not like they've come out unscathed or anything.

I still think it's not too late because the shoe to drop is going to be their earnings call, and the news that they're reducing their production is just the tip of the iceberg.

Tesla on the other hand, I'm more unsure. On one hand, the muskrat has claimed that they have a multi year backlog and just can't produce those cars fast enough. On another, there are lingering quality issues, China weakness, supply chain issues, and the car is expensive as fuck, in a context where people are trying to save every dime.
One catalyst I can see for tesla going down is the investors smell that their pre-orders start to get canceled. They will realize the growth is not their, leading to a big pull-out.",t3_xromms,1664519065.0,3

Tesla also has an extreme advantage in pricing, if they need to they can create and or kill demand very quickly through their pricing. Thanks to their well above average margins they can create demand if needed, which already should decrease less than the average automaker.

24902,iqhdhrd,t3_xromms,"OP, thanks for the write up and being civil in your responses. I agree with a lot of your reasoning but with Tesla it seems you're letting emotion cloud your judgement. You admit yourself you personally hate the company and Musk and are using that to empower your short thesis. Your puts are green, that's great, basically puts on anything the past couple of months are up big time though.

Musk does not draw a salary he only gets paid in Tesla stock. Therefore, he's highly motivated to stop it from falling too far and to prop it up when need be. Tesla's volatility makes it seem OK to short any rips upward but take your profits quickly or else face losing all your gains and then end up impotently hating Musk even more.",t3_xromms,1664533797.0,1

And again, Tesla has price advantages over these other brands with plenty of room to drop prices and still profit more than the industry average. When In reality these other brands will most likely need to raise prices, like we are already seeing happen to ford.

That's also why they are blaming the fed so hard for 'letting them' get this far away from the ground.thats a doomer theory though. We will turn back up well before the ground because the fed will eventually break. 

There's a 3rd scenario too. If you look at apple and Tesla macds  they are bad but at a very different point than the spy macd.

The issue is they are probably 10% of the index between the two of them. This is creating a fear that if apple and Tesla break, the entire market flushes while they have a normal cycle down.

Or the market bounces a bit while Tesla and apple underperform.

25404,jdzubaj,t1_jdzr878,"That makes sense, delta goes like the square too (or more properly appears in BS as gamma) which might fuck puts. And yes, makes sense that IV spikes are likelier to benefit puts rather than calls. So is the thing to do when picking plays dated around key events to monitor vanna = d2(V)/(dSdsigma)?
