0,I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022,2424,x1fjlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x1fjlg/i_tried_4_paid_services_for_stock_selection_here/,204,1661855480.0,"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits.

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

Intel (INTC): -29%

JFrog (FROG): -17%

Procore (PCOR): -18%

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%
2. Redacted by mods: +7%

6. Inspire Medical Systems: +14%
7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

Note: Wrote this a week ago and much of the recs I couldn't put in because of the mods banning discussion of them"
1,Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard.,1854,yfwujj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yfwujj/apple_today_is_a_good_example_why_the_markets_are/,405,1666981859.0,"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP? You'll still have your job."

Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Domino’s, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc…) and usually driven by questions like, “can I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock?” And “can I buy YouTube stock?” Or “mom shops at Target” and “I like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.”

4,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),1194,10hueqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10hueqy/apples_business_is_simply_an_earnings_machine_roc/,204,1674316790.0,"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above."
5,"Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop",1178,xskenq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xskenq/facebook_scrambles_to_escape_stocks_death_spiral/,388,1664593516.0,"A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.

Today the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.

Facebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.

Investors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.

“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.

“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”

When you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”

## ‘Force for good or evil’

The last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.

Meta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”

Dollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.

“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

7,Netflix is the worst FAANGM investment and it's getting worse,1094,1097x21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1097x21/netflix_is_the_worst_faangm_investment_and_its/,350,1673452165.0,"Source: The FAANMGs: Google Is A Buy, Netflix Is A Goodbye

NFLX holds $6.1 billion in cash equivalents and has $13.9b in long-term debt. Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.

NFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.

Competition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.

However, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry $717 million in 3Q22.

Furthermore, while the other five FAANMG’s have investment grade credit ratings, Moody's still rates NFLX at Ba1/positive, a notch below investment grade.

Analysts’ price targets support my observations. The average 12-month price target for META, AAPL, and MSFT are each roughly 30% higher than the current share prices. AMZN and GOOGL have price targets that are 66% and 61.7% above the current share valuations, respectively.

NFLX? Analysts give that stock an upside of 1.3%."

Apple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn’t provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.

Apple reported second-fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street’s soft expectations for sales and revenue, driven by stronger-than-anticipated iPhones sales.

However, Apple’s overall sales fell for the second quarter in a row.

I was just so convinced that this 28 multiple with 2% revenue growth was going to reverse.  Especially if they increase the price on iphones, how can you justify spending so much when its going to be a recession.  Just felt way overbought.  Every hedge fund is feeling the recession fear in 2023 and wants to hide some place and I think that is what is driving this crazy multiple right now.  Plus the AAPL event coming up in early september.  

And today it got upgraded and 2 bucks away from where it started the year.  

You cant believe the kind of FOMO I am feeling right now to just go and buy it.  But I am resisting.

So, yes, I made that cardinal mistake.  Bring on your, you are so stupid comments.  I deserve it.

Meta’s Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years.

Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn’t spray your data across the web. And, of course, there’s Apple’s recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.

In the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people’s iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple’s looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook’s ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it’s looking for two product managers who are “inspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world” and who want to “design and build consumer advertising experiences.” An ideal candidate, Apple said, won’t only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with “performance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.” 

The listings also state that Apple’s looking for a manager who can “drive multi-year strategy and execution,” which suggests that Apple isn’t just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple’s privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta’s entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. “If you talk to any small business, they’ll tell you, ‘Yeah, right now is a disaster,” said Eric Seufert, one analyst who’s been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. “It’s just a meltdown. There’s been a complete, devastating change to the environment.”

Robinhood Markets is launching an index to track the favorite stocks of its millions of predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. The brokerage firm’s new “Robinhood Investor Index” will track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. Initially, the top five stocks in the index will be Tesla , Apple, Amazon.com, Ford Motor and meme-stock favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings. Robinhood said it would update the composition of the index monthly, offering a view into its customers’ changing tastes. In an unusual approach to constructing an index, Robinhood said it would weight stocks in the index by the “conviction” customers have in them, defined as the percentage of assets in a customer's portfolio devoted to a particular stock. 

That means that if many Robinhood users devote a large part of their portfolio to one stock, it would rank higher in the index, even if those users' holdings were relatively small. Robinhood tends to have less-affluent customers, with smaller accounts, than other brokerages.

Robinhood has experimented with sharing such data before. During the early months of the pandemic, it released hourly data on the popularity of stocks among its customers, which were aggregated by the third-party website Robintrack.net. The site became a popular way to track retail-investor activity until Robinhood shut off the data feed in August 2020, citing concerns that its data could be “misconstrued or misunderstood.”"
17,AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,526,14guw7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14guw7p/aapl_stock_continues_climb_to_3t_with_new_trading/,207,1687515871.0,"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.  
  
The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.  
  
Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn’t last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year’s end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.  
  
And while Apple stock saw the company’s valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn’t closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.  
  
Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.  
  
In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.  
  
Apple Vision Pro, the company’s all-new AR/VR product, will hit stores in the United States in early 2024. The product carries a $3,499 price tag. Corrective lenses are sold separately."
18,Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market,485,w8eg5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w8eg5o/big_tech_earnings_are_about_to_determine_the/,134,1658824803.0,"Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 index’s market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.

As Big Tech — Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% — prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported.

Amazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the “worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that “people are going to freak out.”

Any big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group’s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.

This year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens — Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.

I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).

So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:

1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.

2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)

Do you have any similar examples?"

**Active installed base of devices reaches all-time high for all major product categories**

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter ended September 24, 2022. The Company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.29, up 4 percent year over year. Annual revenue was $394.3 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and annual earnings per diluted share were $6.11, up 9 percent year over year.

“This quarter’s results reflect Apple’s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.”

“Our record September quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute effectively in spite of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow, and returned over $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter. The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple (AAPL.NaE), with revenue growing over $28 billion and operating cash flow up $18 billion versus last year.”

Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 10, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022.

Yes, so far it has just been going down and down with the exception of the last week but there are some solid stocks to buy and hold for the short/mid term. Here are my current recent picks: 

SONY = Strong company, good fundamentals and overall a brand name most people alive today have used. Does not deserve the current price it is at ($82). Current holdings = 6 shares. 

AAPL = Same as above except it does not deserve to be as low as where it is at currently ($147). Current holdings = 97 shares. 

DIS = Disney, yes Disney is down nearly 40% YTD. I see this stock soaring as oil prices ease, which in my opinion is a main contributor as to why it is so low currently (not the main contributor though). I see this stock as a win if we do go into a recession or do not go into a recession. If no recession happens the parks and merchandise will go back to pre-COVID profits. If we do have a recession then in my opinion Disney+ will keep pumping in funds. Current price of $95 and I see it going above $130 by end of December. Current holdings = 44 shares. 

WFC = Wells Fargo should be well above the current price of $40 per share. The pros all agree [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WFC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WFC) (Citi for example went from neutral to buy in April).

24,Apple opens its first store in India as it looks for a new generation of iPhone users,317,12qorcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12qorcb/apple_opens_its_first_store_in_india_as_it_looks/,61,1681827881.0,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/apple-opens-first-store-in-india-in-iphone-sales-manufacturing-push.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/apple-opens-first-store-in-india-in-iphone-sales-manufacturing-push.html)

[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) on Tuesday opened its first store in India, highlighting the importance of the market to the iPhone maker’s future.

The first store, called Apple BKC, is located in the populous city of Mumbai. Apple on Thursday will open another store in the capital of Delhi.

The Cupertino giant said it has been present in India for more than 25 years.

“India has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we’re excited to build on our long-standing history,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release published Monday.

Cook posted a photo of himself and staff at the new apple store on Monday.

Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company’s biggest markets.

Apple claims its Mumbai store is “one of the most energy-efficient” locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store’s operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said.

Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple’s future and in February he said he was “bullish” on the world’s fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a “significant amount of energy” into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, [nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/19/here-are-the-challenges-apples-tim-cook-faces-on-his-india-trip.html).

India’s smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as [Xiaomi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1810-HK/), with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India.

But India is undergoing a “premiumification of market,” according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah. He said this category of smartphones accounts for 35% of total smartphone market revenue.

“Apple as usual has got the timing right on ‘peaking at the right time’ with its flagship store strategy to catalyse this trend in its favour,” Shah told CNBC via email.

India has a growing middle class, a young and “mobile first” population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country’s wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores.

## iPhone sales in focus

Apple’s India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said.

Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India “has the potential to reach that scale” in the coming years.

Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country.

Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.

“Apple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,” Ives said in a note published Tuesday.

But it’s not just about selling iPhones. Apple’s strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music.

“Apple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,” Shah said.

## Manufacturing push

For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future.

Apple [began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/apple-starts-manufacturing-the-iphone-14-in-india.html) last year — the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India’s minister of commerce and industry, said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India.

Part of the move in India is tied to the government’s push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world’s second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak.

[Production was disrupted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/06/apple-warns-covid-restrictions-in-china-are-hurting-iphone-production-.html) last year at Apple’s biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a [Covid outbreak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/apples-iphone-plant-in-china-run-by-foxconn-hit-with-covid-outbreak.html) and [worker protests](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/iphone-maker-foxconn-entices-workers-in-china-to-return-after-unrest.html). That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn.

Wedbush’s Ives said Apple’s India strategy — with both a retail and manufacturing push — mirrors the technology giant’s steps it took in the China market 10 years ago.

“As Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,” Iva said.

“Rome was not built overnight and neither will Apple’s broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.”"

It's hard to see AAPL moving much higher from here given the valuation and it's also hard to see the market moving much higher without AAPL.

In March AAPL staged a similar recovery almost making new highs before selling off and making new lows.

AAPL is a great company and while I feel it deserves a slight premium to the market I'm struggling to remain bullish given the current valuation. I'm also concerned that AAPL nearing ATHs could once again be signalling peak market bullishness.

I sold half my position on Friday and I'm curious to hear what others are thinking about this stock and the recent bullishness we've seen in the tech stocks generally."
27,AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,271,141qpd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/141qpd4/aapl_price_dump_after_vr_headset_reveal/,312,1685996832.0,"The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.

* Yes, it looks like ski goggles.
* The OS is called **Vision Pro**
* The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:

* If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out

Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).

Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.

Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.

META & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.

Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.

The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).

Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.

So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this."

33,There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks.,246,y9xr61,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y9xr61/theres_more_to_index_funds_and_stocks_than_vti/,54,1666368988.0,"An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?

The answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]

This post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.

**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**

[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

From another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):

> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.


But even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).

**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**

 Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

This has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [""Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk""](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]

Thus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.

**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**

- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).

> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.

> 
> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.

Goldman Sachs analyst:

>  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. ""This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&P 500,"" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.

**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**


> Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”

> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”
> 
> Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!”

**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**

>  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&P 500. 


Source: Ben Felix's various videos on small cap value.

You aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.

**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**

Because market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?

**Ticker recommendations**:

I use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.

I explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. 

> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies ""tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning
their prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent
underperformance."" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.

34,Will Apple be a $4 trillion dollar stock by 2024?,237,14e7eyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14e7eyk/will_apple_be_a_4_trillion_dollar_stock_by_2024/,189,1687256919.0,"* Apple’s market cap rose from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3 trillion in 2022.
* Reaching the $4 trillion market cap by 2024 could be very challenging.
* New products, services, and acquisitions could help it reach that milestone.  


# The law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Apple yet.

Apple ($AAPL) became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018. It also became the first to cross the $2 trillion mark in August 2020, and the first to reach the $3 trillion milestone in January 2022.  
  
Apple's market cap is still hovering near the $3 trillion mark as of this writing, but could it maintain its biennial tradition and hit a $4 trillion market cap by 2024? Let's review its past growth, projected growth rates, and valuations to decide.

# How did Apple become a $3 trillion company?

Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last September), Apple's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Meanwhile, its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at an even higher CAGR of 21.6%.  
  
In other words, Apple's annual EPS nearly tripled from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 -- so it makes sense that its stock price nearly quadrupled over the past five years. However, Apple's valuations have also risen at a faster rate than its actual profits. On the last day of fiscal 2017, Apple's stock traded at $154.12 ($38.53 on a split-adjusted basis), which was only 13 times the diluted EPS of $11.91 it would generate in fiscal 2018. Today, Apple trades at 28 times forward earnings.

Apple's path from $1 trillion to $3 trillion was paved by both its own EPS growth and its rising valuations. Its earnings growth was driven by its robust sales of iPhones (which still account for over half its revenue), iPads, Macs, and the expansion of its services segment with more subscription-based services. Its valuations rose as more investors turned to Apple as a safe-haven bet while the pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the broader markets. 

Apple's EPS also usually grows at a faster clip than its net income because it buys back billions of dollars in shares every year. It repurchased 19% of its shares over the past five years, as well as a whopping 38% of its shares over the past decade.

# How could Apple become a $4 trillion company?

For Apple to reach a $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024, its stock would need to rise nearly 40% over the next 18 months. That could be quite difficult, for two simple reasons.  
  
First, analysts expect Apple's EPS to dip 2% in fiscal 2023, rise 9% in fiscal 2024, and grow 10% to $7.17 per share in fiscal 2025. Assuming Apple still trades at 28 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2025, its stock would only be trading 9% higher at about $200 -- which would give it a market cap of just under $3.2 trillion.  
  
Second, Apple's valuations are historically high -- so I could see its forward multiple drop back to 20 during a market downturn. If that happens, Apple's stock could decline to the mid-$140s, and its market cap would shrink to about $2.2 trillion.

# Pay attention to the wild cards

Based on analysts' estimates, should take with a grain of salt, it seems unlikely that Apple will reach a $4 trillion valuation by the end of 2024. However, those forecasts don't account for all the wild cards that Apple can still play.   
  
Apple's upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset in early 2024 will mark its first major hardware launch since its introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. Its high price tag of $3,500 might limit its initial appeal, but a stronger-than-expected launch could drive analysts to boost their revenue and earnings estimates.  
  
Apple also ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across all of its services, which represented 18% growth from a year ago. That massive audience gives it plenty of room to launch new apps and services.  
  
Lastly, Apple is still sitting on $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. It could deploy a lot of that cash on fresh investments and acquisitions (perhaps on media companies for its services ecosystem or some chipmakers for its first-party chips). 

# Look beyond Apple's market cap

I believe Apple will eventually be worth $4 trillion one day, but I don't expect it to reach that milestone by the end of 2024. Instead, investors should simply recall that Apple generates stable growth, commands fierce customer loyalty, locks in its customers with sticky services, and rewards its patient investors with buybacks and dividends. All of those strengths make Apple a great long-term investment -- regardless of how much the entire company is actually worth."

The decision stems from a move to be more careful during uncertain times, though it isn’t a companywide policy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The changes won’t affect all teams, and Apple is still planning an aggressive product launch schedule in 2023 that includes a mixed-reality headset, its first major new category since 2015.

36,"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going",163,145049d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/145049d/how_us_stocks_rose_20_from_their_lows_and_where/,86,1686301620.0,"U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.  
  
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

38,Re: My shorting competition post 4 months ago,136,100tiwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/100tiwu/re_my_shorting_competition_post_4_months_ago/,39,1672607382.0,"Hi, about 4 months ago(119 days) I created a thread asking which stocks people here would short through to the end of the year. I’ll link to the original thread in comments below. 

My idea was that a lot of threads here end up being stock hyping threads. I also don’t actually have the money, options knowledge, or cajones to buy puts. Another thing, mathematically, a stock can go up forever but can only go down 100%. You may also have a good idea, but miss on timing. But this was a good way to sit on the sidelines for entertainment purposes, and see how people do. 

**Companies people named, and how they performed since September 2.**(Ordered from best to worst to short) 

1. $CVNA- One person mentioned the stock that I’m choosing as the winner here. -84% u/dartfanatic mentioned this. 
2. $AFRM - Also chosen by the same commenter who chose #1. -56% since our September start date. 
3. $TSLA- - 54%, mentioned by 5 people including myself. I’d have never guessed it would fall so hard and so fast. Thanks Elon. 
4. $COIN- -45% 
5. $ROKU- -38%, someone mentioned that choosing a company like this is a better call than ARKK, they were correct. 
6. $MSTR: - -35% 
7. $AMZN and $LEU: tie at -34% 
8. $META: -24% 
9. $ARKK: -23% 
10. $NSANY: -18% 
11. $AAPL: -16% 
12. $NVDA: -8% but worth noting that they were volatile enough that perhaps you could have sold while it fell -17%, or you could have been ripped to pieces when they popped up 60% from that low. 

Then we start getting into the Short picks that didn’t quite work, which is a shorter list given the tanking market. 

13. $TLT - -9%

14. $LQD - Bond etf, only down -2.7%

15. $JNK - Another bond etf, only -1.8% 

16. $DLVHF- Delivery hero, a European doordash type of stock. Up 8%. 

17. $PST - Treasury shorting etf, up 10% 

18. $GE- +15% 

19. $FSLR- Solar stock,  +18%

20. $PFIX- Interest rate hedge etf, +21% 

21. Finally, the biggest loser actually ended up being the top voted comment in that thread. The commenter picked “BMW or Siemens” because European industrial type of companies should feel the hurt from the Russian war. BMW is up 24% and Siemens up 37% since our starting point in September. 

Happy New Year."

Thank you!

Edit: thanks everyone for the suggestions. Lot of ppl are suggesting VOO or VTI or SPY. My portfolio is already heavily in FXAIX, so it would be redundant to have another fund that tracks the SP500"

Something like 85K is gone as it was tied to stock that I have no position at the moment (e.g., stocks like tdoc which I sold back when it fell around 30, incurring a 50K loss, and now it is trading low 20s, so not regretting it as much as I did when I sold)...

But here are my current holdings, where I am still hanging on hoping to salvage the 115K or so at some point.

ETFS:

25K in VOO, 10K in VTI (both at break even now as I have been DCAing into them)

IQQH (equivalent of ICLN in europe): 12K (-25%)

SMH: 4K (-0.7%)

WCBR: 12K (-35%)

Stocks:

AAPL: 22K (-0.1%)

MSFT: 40K (-10%)

GOOG: 41K (-20%)

AMZN: 27K (-30%)

PYPL: 28K (-44%)

SE: 12k (-53%)

For the sake of peace of mind, will it be a good approach to slowly get out of my stock positions and dca more into VOO and VTI (say for example, liquidate 100K of my big tech stocks in the coming few weeks and start DCAing 5K into VOO/VTI every week for 20 weeks).

PS: I don't need the money for quite some time (I want to buy a condo next year, but I have 100K or so in my savings account). I have a good income, and barring some calamity, I think I can be able to save back the 200k I lost in max 3 years."

I rode the rally up from June low on 50% cash but now I'm thinking of selling all my MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA ASML LRCX etc till we get to sp500 2000 or so.

I just don't see the point in holding my MSFT and stuff.

I got in MSFT at $220 and my AAPL is basis $103 but I feel by October MSFT will be at $150 and AAPL will be at $80 or less so I'd rather get out now.

I'm still negative so I'll have no tax consequences, but I'll have wash sales but that's no.biggie for me.

I'll keep my UNH since I'm up 54% since buying it 1.6 years ago and probably keep things like UNP NEE COST and my ENPH.

So anyone else selling all their tech?

I just think MSFT and AAPL will be going down at ver least 50% so why lose money when I can just buy in lower?

I like MSFT and AAPL, but I think tech will get crushed now.

So basically I'm 50% cash and maybe gonna up to 70% cash or so till end of October maybe.

Good luck all! Keep the faith!

48,"Apple, Microsoft, Google AI Search War",83,10yrbbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10yrbbp/apple_microsoft_google_ai_search_war/,117,1676033796.0,"So recent news has indicated that Google has everything to lose. Microsoft AI Bing appears to be significantly more useful than Google’s search engine in terms of less clutter and better to the point results. 

Since Google pays Apple an estimated 20billion per year to be the default search engine on IOS, Apple has the most powerful position in this war. They can easily negotiate a new contract with Microsoft. This will absolutely destroy Google’s business. The only way for Google to maintain its position as the default browser would be to pay more than Microsoft or invest heavily into the technology. Either way, their margins get hit. 
Microsoft has nothing to lose but some of its massive cash position. But the obstacle stopping mass adoption of Bing would be Apple’s position as Judge, Jury and Executioner. 

My thoughts going forward? Apple is the king, and this further proves it. Whilst Google and Microsoft fight for search, Apple laughs at the two companies whilst it attaches any price tag it wants for the default browser. So Apple is the only company that’s currently profiting from the war. If GOOG or MSFT don’t pay up, AAPL can go create their own search engine and seamlessly integrate it into their devices. My conviction in Apple is now stronger."

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&P 500 goes below 4000.

&#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

Disclaimer: I am long index funds and GOOGL. I also hold couple QQQ puts for hedging which got burned."

With the declining Android/PC sales but increasing iPhone/mac sales, it’s just a matter of time the grip Apple has over other consumer big / medium tech grows as Apple pursue complete domination of operating systems adoption through the world.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2022/10/05/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-used-price-resale-value/amp/ 

Tldr : used phone retailer SellCell says that price of IPhone 14 resale has dropped by 50%, meaning people don't want to hold on to their phones and want to get rid of it at a lower price.


https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/10/25/apple-iphone-glass-maker-corning-says-smartphone-sales-are-plummeting/amp/ 

Corning, maker of Gorilla glass for iPhone and iPad says it expects 14% year-over-year decrease in smartphone sales volume and a 17% drop in orders for tablets and laptops. They make other smartphones too  but the bulk of their revenue comes from Apple, I think.



https://www.notebookcheck.net/Disappointing-iPhone-14-14-Plus-sales-allegedly-prompt-Foxconn-to-cut-production-in-favor-of-the-iPhone-14-Pro-14-Pro-Max.658335.0.html 

IPhone 14 and and iPhone 14 Max are selling comparatively worse than the Pro models. But since pro models account for less sales since they are 100 to 200$ more, overall sales are down. 

https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/18/iphone-14-plus-demand/amp/ 

https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-cuts-iphone-14-plus-production-less-than-two-weeks-after-debut 

Apple has asked at least assembler to “immediately halt [iPhone 14 Plus] production.” as they ""reassess""
Also 2  Apple suppliers in China that rely on the parts and assemble them into larger modules are also cutting their production 70% and 90% respectively 

According to Wayne MA's source, these  changes are due to demand. Also, he confirms that the Pro and Pro max sales are insignificant compared to the Non-pro devices. 

Another worry is on the wearable of Apple, who are considered the most discretionary as they are usually seen as gifts for others. With inflation this high, people are very likely to cut costs and impact yet another lucrative revenue stream for Apple. 


Is it finally time for the Apple to fall ? Michael Burry sure thinks so."

Is it more or less short covering that make these type of stocks rally further than other stocks during upswings?

Anyways I'm thinking it's a good trade for a small portion of a portfolio to have some ARKK CARVANA or whatever to make a quick buck and then sell, especially if you're in the red this year as there won't be any gains.

Is there an etf other than ARKK that contains these types of stocks?

I'm thinking maybe IGY or Invescos extended tech etf, but I don't think it contains any weight in stuff like snap, cvna, amc, pton, etc.

I find it interesting that all these ""crap"" companies rallied like 14% the other day!

Must be short covering?

Why would shorts cover? Why do people rush back in to the no earning, risky stuff?

I've heard though that the long dated, no earnings assets are usually the first and fastest to recover.

Why?

For example, CVNA went up 35% this week! Could you imagine if you had a large amount in that?! Whoa!  

MSFT and AAPL didn't go up 35% this week that's for sure!"

[Broadcom](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AVGO/)

 — Shares of the chipmaker popped 5% on the back of a  stronger-than-expected quarterly report. Broadcom earned $10.33 per  share on revenue of $8.92 billion. Analysts expected a profit of $10.10  per share on revenue of $8.92 billion. The company also issued fiscal  second-quarter guidance that beat expectations. 

[Integral Ad Science](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IAS/)

 — Shares jumped 10% after the digital ad company posted an earnings and  revenue beat in the fourth quarter. Revenue came in at $117.4 million,  topping StreetAccount’ consensus estimate of $111.3 million. Fourth  quarter earnings of $40 million also beat estimates of $36.9 million.

The company earned an  adjusted 37 cents per share, above the 29 cents expected by analysts,  according to Refinitiv.

[JBG Smith Properties](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JBGS/)

*—*  Shares for the real estate investment trust and builder were down 6.2%  after Amazon announced that it would pause construction on its Virginia  headquarters.

[Samsara](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IOT/)

 — Shares of the internet of things company rallied more than 18.8% on  the back of stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The stock  also got a boost from management commentary pointing toward breakeven  free cash flow by year-end."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

62,Trading through volatile times .. 2023,52,zp3eiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zp3eiu/trading_through_volatile_times_2023/,55,1671383914.0,"I had a new thought last night that of course during upcoming turbulent markets when you expect that things may get bad its better to go maybe 80% cash and then trade with 10 to 20%.

Basically half the battle in investing is preserving what you already have and not necessarily going for huge gains, especially in crappy times.

Yes, you may miss out on rallies if you're 80% cash, but I don't see any new sustained bull markets happening any time soon!

So my idea is this.

Maybe 80% cash in money market where it's totally liquid.

Then I play my hand and gamble with very small amounts to very slowly add to my existing balance.

Yes, adding $500 here and there is not much but I'm also preserving 80% of my hard earned money while others may lose 40% if the sp500 sells off in the upcoming months.

My method is something like this.

80 to 90% cash in mm.

Then I put 10% or whatever in QQQ.

I wait.

As soon as I gain $500 or so I sell and am patient again and wait for a sizeable drop. Maybe 5 to 10%.

Then I reenter and do it again.

This could also be done with a stock like aapl or unh or something.

This way I'm gambling with only 10% of my money and preserving 90% through a very volatile period that most see in 2023s first half at least.

Either that or I just hold the (QQQ) with 10% and add little by little on large dips.

So I'm effectively preserving my 90% (Maybe that's a bit high!ĺ) and then only 10% is ""sloshing around"".

If we go down 30% eventually ( by February or March 2023) then I move more into QQQ . Maybe 20% more or something.

Ride it up and then trim a little if we get back to present levels?

Just an idea."

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

66,How did you originally pick your longest held and/or best positions? What did you learn from those picks?,40,wefw0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wefw0u/how_did_you_originally_pick_your_longest_held/,33,1659457020.0,"Per the title. I'm curious about how you originally identified what are now your longest/best holdings. What made you take notice of those companies in the first place? What have you learned from whatever methodology you used to locate those top picks?

I think it's useful to honestly look back at the original thesis/logic if we want to replicate success. It's easy to get sidetracked with strategy, but in the end, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak...so what went into your pudding?

&#x200B;

**For me:**

The longer I continue my journey with stocks (\~15 years now), the more I favor getting back to the basic axiom of investing in what you know. Of course this is a well known strategy (Peter Lynch, etc.), but I've been thinking more about it lately in the context of my own portfolio and how it has evolved over time. Most of the stocks that turned out best for me follow this rule, though I wasn't explicitly following the Lynch playbook at purchase (because I didn't know who he was at the time).

My top 5 most successful (and also longest...not a coincidence) holdings are:

* AAPL - 10 years - bought my first iPhone and was absolutely blown away by it, coming from an Android device. iPhone seemed almost absurdly better than its nearest competition at that time, which seemed like a pretty good baseline investment thesis. 
* COST - 8 years - bought after visiting a Costco with my parents in law and then immediately joining myself.  Came to the stock as a result. I still love Costco, the company and the stock.
* CRM - 5 years - bought after selecting Salesforce as our main operations hub at my former employer. Became familiar with Salesforce admin, saw the platform's power and flexibility, saw it in action, saw how it moved the dial, saw how it quickly becomes a must-have tool. 
* UPS - 5 years - Was working a lot with FedEx. Their service was slipping and prices were going up. Missed deliveries. Not easy to deal with. Started using UPS...better service, better store experience, better prices, more reliable deliveries. Bought the stock. And of course they started eating FedEx's lunch.
* AVGO - 4 years - This is the outlier. I bought based on a generally favorable outlook for semis, and they seemed highly financially secure, are broadly exposed to the semiconductor industry (sort of a picks and shovels play; AMAT is my other), and pay a large and growing dividend. Worked out well despite my lack of direct personal knowledge.

Conclusion: I didn't read Lynch until relatively recently, and I wish I'd discovered him earlier, because the foundation of my portfolio is composed of my ""Lynch stocks"", and in hindsight, I could have avoided a lot of painful lessons and headhaches if I'd just started out picking from a basket of companies I know, like, admire and trust.

I'm increasingly thinking that ""invest in what you know"" is less about finding the best companies - though that's part of it - and more about finding the deep conviction to hang tight over many years, which is where a lot of the outperformance is generated.

I also note that none of these picks were particularly cheap when I bought them. The best companies are rarely cheap.

Thoughts? Experiences?

&#x200B;

\[Edit because a poster brought up a good point: this is mostly about the initial identification of a potential investment. Yes, further financial due diligence is also important before making a final decision.\]

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

79,Apple's mixed reality headset announcement sends Unity stock soaring,33,142bzin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/142bzin/apples_mixed_reality_headset_announcement_sends/,11,1686048515.0,"Unity Software (U) stock soared on Monday, rising nearly 20% into the close after a shoutout during Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference.  
  
Unity's gaming software will be used in Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, Apple announced on Monday.

""We know there is a community of developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years,"" Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations said during the WWDC presentation. And today we are excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to vision OS features such as pass-through, high-resolution renderings, and native gestures.""  
  
**Volume in Unity stock shot up to more than triple the 20-day moving average as the stock had its best intraday performance since November 10.**

Unity operates a cross-platform game engine that was first discussed at an Apple WWDC in 2005 in regard to the Mac. The company went public in 2020 and the stock was bought up to nearly $200 a share during the 2021 tech surge in stocks. Ark Innovation Founder Cathie Wood is a shareholder. Unity is the 15th largest holding in Ark's flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and represents 3.46% of the total portfolio.  


On May 10, Unity reported first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates for revenue while posting a wider-than-expected loss per share. **Unity reported first-quarter revenue of $500.36 million compared to Wall Street estimates of $477.67**. Unity's adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.09 was more than $0.01 the Street had been expecting.  
  
Like others in the gaming sector, Unity spent its first-quarter earnings call positioning itself as an AI winner.  
  
""AI is going to have a profound effect on the industry,"" Unity CEO John S. Riccitiello said on the company's earnings call. ""First, it's going to lead to inflection up in growth as game types are built that were no longer — were not previously possible. And secondly, we're going to see, I believe, some of the crazy expense that goes on in some high-end production come down some. It's a favorable part of the game industry for growth. And I guess it'd be very favorable for Unity as we drive some of these changes through the industry."""

Therefore , I’m looking at stocks that will be a good long term hold , at least 1+ years. I was thinking of buying Google stock and DCA over the next few months as I add funds. I already have a good amount of AAPL in my Roth IRA as well as some safer index funds.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

84,$AAPL - more room to grow?,38,13m0hg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13m0hg1/aapl_more_room_to_grow/,151,1684513797.0,"Looking at the five year chart, it looks like AAPL is almost back to all time high at $179.45 on Dec 10, 2021. 

During the past two years, I don’t see Apple releasing any innovative product. Yet the economic situation and consumer spending today is obviously worse than 2021. 

What do y’all think about $AAPL at $175 today? Is there more room for $AAPL to grow or is it time to trim down some positions?"
85,Huge Volume spike across the board on Friday,35,zq6nea,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zq6nea/huge_volume_spike_across_the_board_on_friday/,22,1671491207.0,"Literally all stocks i have on my (qqq/tech) watchlist had a huge (5x - 30x as usual) volume spike end of day on friday. 

See aapl, amzn, meta, googl, tsla, wbd, pypl, amd and so on.

Obv it has to do with rebalancing indices or sth. But why last friday. And why such a huge amount? I checked last december same timeframe and there were no such spikes. Just want to learn sth. :)

Edit*
No volume spike in my watchlist: V, MA, TGT, TSM, VEEV, DY, UBER

Edit2*

One further question: how can they accumulate pr sell THAT much stocks in 10 mins before close with literally NO price movement?"
86,Can your picks outperform hype? (Introducing the Over Priced Index),37,10hzxrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10hzxrk/can_your_picks_outperform_hype_introducing_the/,14,1674330820.0,"So recently I asked everyone what the most overpriced stock was and I got plenty of different choices to pick from (post below). With this information, I introduce to you..... The Reddit's Over Priced Index!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats\_the\_most\_over\_priced\_stock/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats_the_most_over_priced_stock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Here's how it works. Every ticker was 1 vote for that company. Each vote takes up a portion of the portfolio so more votes for one company means that company will take up more space (EX. TSLA had 8 votes whereas SPCE had one so Tesla takes up 8 times as much space). Every vote counted - so even if I disagreed, I can't remove any votes. The votes are closed so sorry to all that didn't get the chance but not to worry because the portfolio will either be updated quarterly or semi-annually depending on how lazy I am.

The real 2 things we're trying to find out:

1. Are these stocks really driven by Hype and overpriced?
2. Can you out-preform the index? (check the future updates to see if you can!)

&#x200B;

Without further ado, here are the holdings! (Ordered from most votes to least).

There are 37 stocks with a total of 65 votes. The number that follows the ticker is the percentage (%) it holds in the portfolio

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline.
*****
> Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop.
*****
> Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence.
*****
> “If you’re afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,” Sri-Kumar Global’s Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. “Equities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don’t trust [Friday’s] rally.”
*****
> Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward.
*****
> Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January’s blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month.
*****
> On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That’s compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.

96,Risk assessed trading on the NASDAQ at the beginning of a new 2023 bull market.,34,10uujsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10uujsb/risk_assessed_trading_on_the_nasdaq_at_the/,62,1675648872.0,"Good Sunday to you! Last week I initiated some big call option trades based on my thesis that we have entered a new bull market.

I've purchased 36 call option contracts on $TQQQ.

26 TQQQ 02/17/2023 33.00 C and 10 TQQQ 02/10/2023 32.00 C.

Here's why I believe the NASDAQ index will be higher in the next two weeks, compared to this past week.

Last week, here are the returns of the major indices and what they mean...

S&P 500: +2.93%

\--> General market trend is up.

Dow Jones: +0.58%

\--> Rotating out of safe names.

NASDAQ: +5.45%

Russell 2000: 5.3%

\--> Risky names are up.

Consumer Discretionary: +7.63%

\--> Consumer confidence is up.

Oil and Gas: Down

Metals: Down

\--> Inflation is down.

$AAPL strong uptrend --> the ""King"" is strong.

$TSLA medium uptrend --> the ""Prince"" is strong.

$GME medium uptrend --> the ""Jester"" is strong.

\--> The market in general is strong.

$QQQ strong uptrend --> The NASDAQ is strong.

If the NASDAQ goes up, $TQQQ goes up 3x that.

If the NASDAQ goes down, $TQQQ goes down 3x that.

$TQQQ has a 56% chance to go up between 1-2% on 2023-02-06 according to Merlin.

... Therefore ...

I'm bullish on risk-on trades over the next 2 weeks at least! Especially in the first half of the upcoming trading week.

I hope you found this analysis useful. Happy trading, wizards!"

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
> S&P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
> The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
> Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
> Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
> The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
> “Typically, US investors wouldn’t care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,” said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
> On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed’s six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# **S&P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
> The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
> The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed’s efforts to fight it.
*****
> “The economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier & Associates.
*****
> “You just can’t win right now on macro numbers,” he added. “That is why it’s now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.”
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
> Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors’ hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
> For December, the S&P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

> # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan’s (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

> The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ’s approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

> For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ’s rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

> The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ’s newly set implicit cap.

> # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
> Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ’s decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dollar-vs-Yen.png))**

> # A Preview of Things to Come?
> The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen’s depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan’s new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

> This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We’ll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

> # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

> As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

> About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

> This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

> # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

> Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

> Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

> # Day After Christmas NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

> Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

> It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

> NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

> Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

> Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

> # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

> “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”
—Yale Hirsh

> One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn’t the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

> Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

> Here’s a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

> These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn’t been higher seven years in a row since the ‘70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&P 500 does after each.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

> The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn’t come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

> Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren’t very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn’t right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn’t a strategy, but I’m hoping for some green during the SCR!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

> Finally, the average gains each year for the S&P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn’t ignore either.

> Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

> We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I’ll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

> As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

> # No Worse Year for Sentiment

> The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

> With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

> As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

> With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

> In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

> # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

> As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

> Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

> For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Anyone else notice the volume bar GOOG put in today on the 4hr chart? If you look on the 5m chart, it was the 4:00pm EST candle. Anyone know when GOOG announces the buybacks that they make? Is it during earnings? Because I would be interested to see if this was a large buyback. You saw this across a lot of stocks today at the close, AAPL with volume typically only seen on earnings. Monday is the day companies typically start their buyback blackout period before earnings so that's why I'm thinking buybacks. Very unusual nevertheless. Thoughts?"

Not a big tech.  I consider the following big tech: MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, GOOG, NVDA, META, TSLA, NFLX.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

*****
> Stock futures traded lower Thursday, building on the losses from the previous session, as rate and recession fears dented market sentiment.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 277 points, or 0.8%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.8% and 1%, respectively.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a losing session. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.56% on Wednesday for its worst day since Dec. 15. The Dow shed more than 613 points, or 1.81%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.24%, snapping seven-straight days of gains. Bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo slid, weighing on the broader market.
*****
> Disappointing retail sales and a weaker-than-expected producer price index reading ignited recession fears, sending stocks lower.
*****
> On Thursday, investors will weigh more economic data that could give further clues as how much the Fed may raise interest rates in its upcoming meeting. Initial jobless claims, housing starts and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing survey will be released in the morning. Several central bank leaders including Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard will also speak throughout the day on the path forward.
*****
> Investors have been parsing through the latest data and Fed remarks for clues on how high rates will go. But, while recent numbers point to easing inflation, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon thinks rates will top 5%.
*****
> “I think there’s a lot of underlying inflation, which won’t go away so quick,” Dimon told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
*****
> Investors will also be watching key quarterly reports to see if there is an earnings recession brewing. Netflix and Truist Financial are among companies reporting earnings on Thursday.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&#x200B;

>When Snap Inc. went public in 2017, this column boiled down the entire investment opportunity to one, simple question: [Do you trust Evan Spiegel?](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investing-in-snap-ipo-is-an-impotent-bet-on-unproven-executives-2017-02-23?mod=article_inline)  
>  
>As Snap [**SNAP,** **-0.64%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/SNAP?mod=MW_story_quote) stock heads toward its lowest prices since March 2020, and potentially even lower, that question is even more important, and answering “yes” should be even harder.  
>  
>Three months ago, amid the beginning of a huge slowdown in the ad business, [Snap initiated a unique dividend meant to ensure that the founders maintained control ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-snap-melts-down-its-founders-make-sure-to-protect-the-people-who-matter-themselves-11658452231?mod=article_inline)of the company, even if they sold their stock — protecting themselves. [Then in August, news came that Snap was laying off](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/snap-plans-to-lay-off-roughly-one-in-every-five-employees-according-to-report-11661890384?mod=article_inline) one in five employees. As Snap again reported disappointing results Thursday and saw the stock plunge again, the company decided now was the time to initiate a stock buyback plan, promising to spend up to $500 million to offset the dilution from employee stock plans — in the past nine months, Snap has spent $937 million on stock-based compensation.  
>  
>On the face of it, this seems like an investor-friendly approach — Barron’s pointed out earlier this year that i[nvestors were suffering while employees were faring better with the hefty stock-comp plans](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/snap-stock-ipo-grants-51653411013?mod=mw_quote_news_seemore&mod=article_inline). But it’s also worth pointing out who the biggest investors in Snap are: Spiegel and his co-founder Bobby Murphy.  
>  
>As the company’s largest individual shareholders, Spiegel and Murphy are among the key beneficiaries of Snap’s plans to buy back stock, which usually leads to a boost in the stock price. Those two still control over 99% of the voting power of the company’s capital stock, and as the parent of Snapchat reminded investors in its annual report, “Mr. Spiegel alone can exercise voting control over a majority of our outstanding capital stock.”  
>  
>Shares of[ Snap tumbled an additional 25% to just under $8 in after-hours trading](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/snap-stock-plunges-25-as-advertising-slows-down-executives-decline-to-offer-forecast-11658435618?mod=article_inline), putting them near the lowest prices since March 2020. On Thursday, the company ended regular trading hours with a market capitalization of around $17.91 billion, but that was headed toward $13 billion with the after-hours collapse.  
>  
>Besides protecting themselves and their investment, Snap’s executives have shown little ability to head off big issues, nor offer any worthwhile solutions to the current ad downturn. In the third quarter, its revenue grew a paltry 6%, down from the most recent second-quarter revenue growth of 13%. Snap appears to be in a steady revenue slowdown, from its peak growth of 116% in the June 2021 quarter.  
>  
>Snap has blamed both privacy changes that Apple Inc. [**AAPL,** **-0.33%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote) made to the iPhone that affected ad tracking, and more recently, the macroeconomic advertising climate, while avoiding one of the biggest factors — the rise of TikTok. Top executives didn’t seem to see any of those challenges coming early enough, and did not do enough about them once they did.  
>  
>“The company was slow to react — or acknowledge — the significant headwinds faced by privacy initiatives, compounded by competition, and more recently macro headwinds,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, wrote in a note.  
>  
>The competition factor, mostly from China’s TikTok, was addressed briefly on the company’s call with analysts, but was not really acknowledged by Snap leaders."

I’m very much a ‘set it and forget it’ type of investor. 

Yes, I know that these are covered to a large degree in index funds, but I want to double-down on good, profitable companies that might “own the future”, so to speak. I’ve identified these three from an AI, cloud, entreprise software and infrastructure, and/or hardware and devices perspective. 

Thing is, I can’t wrap my head around how a $1T+ company gets any bigger. Will we be talking about the mega cap floor as being in the $1T+ range in a few years? Will we have ‘giga cap’ next in the $5T range? Seems mind-boggling.

Hoping someone with experience over the decades can lend some wisdom. 

I’d also like to hear your opinions on $GOOG, $MSFT, and $AAPL and their ability to grow by a substantial degree in the next 5-10 years.

Edit: Added DCA in first paragraph."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

What would you change?

I'm actually thinking of just broad marketing (vti) at least 60% of my portfolio instead, but am not quite sure how to go about it.

I'm still about 20% cash right now also.

Here's the top 57% or so of my portfolio:

UNH 9.5%

TSLA 8.8%

VGT 8.8%

QQQ 8.8%

GOOGL 5.3%

AAPL 4.4%

COST  3.3%

NVDA 2.8%

LRCX. 2.7%

ASML  2.0%

ENPH 1.5%

I'm currently about 24% from my ath in November 2021.

So I'm not down that much

The VGT I just added as a trade so I realize it overlaps some of qqq

The remainder of portfolio is cash and things like HD UNP ORLY ODFL VOO XLV etc.

The tsla I added to when it was at 115 and now I'm back to slight gain from being down 65%. So I'm thinking of trimming back 50% on tsla.

I'd like to have more value type etfs for rest of portfolio and maybe 40% growth type.

Or maybe.ill just keep the growth and keep 40% cash in case we drop to 3500 or less eventually.

I actually want to end up with maybe 60% indexed and 30% my own stocks and maybe 10% cash eventually."

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
> Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
> The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
> The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

127,Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,24,znww2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znww2s/reflections_of_poor_decisions_in_2022/,44,1671247290.0,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

130,What's propping SPY up?,26,yr57mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr57mu/whats_propping_spy_up/,42,1668054361.0,"Hi,

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

&#x200B;

||% since 13th Oct 2022|SPY weightage|Contribution|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SPY|\+7.14%|19.09% (SumOfTop5)|\-1.87% (SumOfTop5)|
|AAPL|\-5.68%|6.55%|\-0.37%|
|AMZN|\-23.45%|2.50%|\-0.59%|
|GOOG+L|\-11.85%|3.10%|\-0.37%|
|MSFT|\-4.15%|5.30%|\-0.22%|
|TSLA|\-19.90%|1.64%|\-0.33%|

&#x200B;

EDIT: u/W0rdWaster posted the right answer -- In the last 4 weeks, the top 5 in SPY  are in red, but the rest are doing very well with double-digit green, that's how 80% of the SPY is propping it up by 7%!"

133,My Cherry-Picked take on earnings reports so far: all indications of a strong American consumer in Q2; what will Q3 bring?,24,w9qedj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9qedj/my_cherrypicked_take_on_earnings_reports_so_far/,10,1658956930.0,"Are earnings for this quarter behaving like we are in a recession? My take is the 'earnings compression' if it does happen will have to be postponed to Q3 instead of Q2, by which points inflation will really cool down (based on crashing commodity prices, falling gas prices, tightening real estate, food crisis being overblown). So far, we are not seeing changes in the earning denominator sufficient to really increase P/E ratios dramatically. These are obviously cherry-picked, but I tried to add as many examples and statements as I could. If the consumer really were so weak, you wouldn't see so many contrarian statements from major banks, restaurant chains, auto makers, credit card processors, etc. GDP/inflation numbers are very aggregative metrics, so let's dive into what the actual companies are reporting.

I will not link to where many of these quotes come from due to time and this not being an academic paper, but I took most of them from the news articles in Bloomberg/CNBC/Seeking Alpha and can be googled for verification.


**Big Banks**: 

- JPM expects credit losses to remain abnormally low through much of 2023, because customers haven’t yet drained cash balances that grew fatter during the pandemic, executives said Monday. “Big picture, the near-term credit outlook, especially for the U.S. consumer, remains strong,” said CFO Jeremy Barnum. 
- C: ""Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight.
- BAC: ""Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with continued strong deposit balances and spending levels,"" said CEO Brian Moynihan. Earlier this month, BofA said credit and debit card spending rose 11% in June.

**Restaurants/Food:**

- Chipotle/MCD report weakening demand from lower income consumers, but overall strong sales beats. In MCD, they see more substitution from fancier restaurants to MCD, and for Chipotle, they already cater to a slightly richer crowd.
- Major beat from KO. “We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,” Coke Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said. Consumers who missed experiences such as dining out and entertainment during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic are willing to spend more now, Coke Chief Executive James Quincey said. Executives said the company is preparing for consumers’ purchasing power to come under increasing pressure in the second half of the year.

**Credit Card:** 

- Visa reporting strong consumer and lots of travel. ""Consumers are back on the road, visiting various corners of the world, resulting in cross-border travel volume surpassing 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began in early 2020,"" said Chairman and CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr."" 

**Auto:**

- GM wrote ""“I would say that at the end of the day, all the data that we’ve seen to date on vehicle pricing and demand remains strong…we still think that there is a big pocket of demand that hasn’t been met yet.""  Tuesday, GM said it expects to make more money in the second half of the year. 
- F expects earnings to triple
- Mercedes: said it expects demand for its vehicles to outstrip supply for the rest of the year.

**Travel:**

- Hilton sees strong growth: The hotel industry has benefited from people spending on travel as well as hotel stays, though rising interest rates and tight financial conditions are stoking fears of a recession. However, credit card and other data indicate that travel demand is likely to remain robust.

**Software/tech:**

- MSFT with such strong guidance it brought the whole market up after its earnings. Azure grew 40% quarter over quarter, a very slight slowdown.
- Spotify eclipsed forecasts and added 6mn subscribers to its service in the second quarter, defying the slowdown at Netflix that has weighed on the music company’s stock price. The company ended June with 188mn subscribers, beating its guidance for 187mn. Total users — which includes those who do not pay — also beat expectations, rising to 433mn.
- JPM on Google after earnings: ""Our primary takeaway is that search’s demand is persistent even in a tough macro advertising environment given its consistent and high ROI while benefiting from its diversification across online and offline as well as across verticals and geographies""

**Ecommerce:**

- Etsy with major beats. ""The company acquired 6M new buyers during the quarter, shaking off concerns of post-pandemic deceleration.""
- AMZN prime day: ""The expanded inventory must have played a key role in enabling Amazon Prime Day 2022 to become the single biggest Prime Day event in its history, with members purchasing more than 300 million items worldwide. ""

**Logistics:**

- FedEx and UPS both beat and affirmed guidance. Daily volume *did* decline, but from historically high levels during the pandemic. [Is this a collapse in the consumer?](https://i.imgur.com/IBDkf8r.png)

**Housing:**

-  D R Hortons: ""The recent DHI results show that the post-pandemic overheated housing market is beginning to cool off. During the third quarter, the company recorded 16,693 new orders which were down 8% YoY. The net new orders slumped due to a meaningful rise in cancellations which rose to 24% as the rapid rise in mortgage rates created a minor panic among homebuyers. However, the good news is that management has mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that the reselling demand is quite good, and the cancellations are being resold smoothly.""

**Commerce Department Data on Retail**:

- ""U.S. retail sales climbed in June by more than forecast in a broad advance, suggesting resilient consumer spending despite decades-high inflation and raising the prospects of an even larger Federal Reserve interest-rate hike this month. The value of overall retail purchases [in June] increased 1%, after an upwardly revised 0.1% decline in May, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. *The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation*.""

**Non-Examples**:

- Retail like WMT/TGT got crushed, but... with the totality of this data, suggests they had poor execution for inventories. They had an issue acquiring good, overbought, and now have to slash prices to get rid of excess inventory. That's less weakening of consumer demand and more bad planning.
- QComm sees weaker smartphone demand, but on the other hand, AAPL sources say strong demand for its iPhone in China.
- Best Buy: The retailer said it expects same-store sales to decline around 11% for the fiscal year, compared with the drop of between 3% and 6% that it forecast in May. 
- DPZ had big miss."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.

Yet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks. I'm curious what percentages of your portfolio are allocated in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT?

I'm a Bogglehead, for the most part, that got a bit too invested in the rise in Tech in 2020 and 2021. I bought quite a bit of SE and SQ and am now down roughly 65% in each position. 

Rather than wait for these stocks to get back to my cost basis price, I had a thought to sell and invest the remainder into more concrete companies (what some are calling ""value Tech"") like AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG. I have exposure in each of these already via my ETFs, but thought that a direct position might help accelerate returns on what's been lost with SE and SQ.

Only thing is, to regain losses, AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG have to rise to substantial levels, basically becoming $4T companies. 

What are your thoughts? Should I stick with SE and SQ and hope for the best? Or, should I sell and invest into better Tech companies?

I own appl at $70 (I sell CCs and puts to reduce my cost basis).  When aapl has dipped to $120-$130 I tell myself I should have sold at $170 …taken profits and rebought.  Since this sell will be long term capital gains the tax won’t be a big deal so not worried.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 8th, 2022.

# **S&P 500, Nasdaq fall Friday, but notch weekly gains after blowout July jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/04/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
> Stocks wavered Friday in a volatile trading session after the July jobs report was much better than expected, as investors assessed what a strong labor market would mean for the Federal Reserve’s rate tightening campaign.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.65 points, or 0.23%, to end at 32,803.47. Even with Friday’s gains, however, it fell on the week. The S&P 500 shed 0.16% to end at 4,145.19, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.50% Friday, falling to 12,657.56. Still, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the first week of August higher.
*****
> Losses were offset by bank stocks, which rose on hopes that interest rate hikes will continue at a solid clip. Energy stocks also gained, but technology companies slumped.
*****
> The labor market added 528,000 jobs in July, easily beating a Dow Jones estimate of a 258,000 increase. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, below the 3.6% estimate. Wage growth also rose more than estimated, up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% higher than a year ago, signaling that high inflation is likely still a problem.
*****
> Stocks opened lower following the report, even as it seemed to indicate the economy was not currently in a recession. Job growth was expected to slow as the Fed continues to hike interest rates to tame inflation, but this report shows a labor market still running hot. That means the central bank may act more aggressively at its next meeting.
*****
> “Anybody that jumped on the ‘Fed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates’ is going to have to get off at the next station, because that’s not in the cards,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “It is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now.”
*****
> Friday’s jobs report is a crucial one as it’s one of two the central bank will see before it decides how much to raise rates at its September meeting. Indeed, traders are already betting on a tougher stance from the Fed. Policy makers will have another jobs report and two more consumer price index numbers to weigh before the central bank makes its next rate decision.
*****

> # Crazy Moves in the Bond Market

> The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) declined over 2% on Friday, which for a sector of the financial universe that is known for its safety, is a relatively rare occurrence. Since the ETF's launch in 2002, only 3.1% of all trading days have been gains or losses of at least 2%. Not only was Friday a big move for TLT, but it was also the third day this week that the ETF was up or down 2% on the trading day. Talk about an uncertain environment! With investors looking to forecast the path and intensity of rate hikes against a backdrop of high inflation, stronger than expected economic data (like Friday's Payroll report) puts upward pressure on yields, while weaker than expected data suggests the economy is cooling off causing bonds to rally and yields to fall.

> As mentioned above, three of the last five trading days have seen daily moves of plus or minus 2%. Only two other periods throughout the history of TLT have seen a higher rate of 2%+ moves in TLT, those being August of 2011 and March of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-rolling-5-day-moves-2-pct-plus-080522.png))**

> Since TLT was launched in 2002, there have only been 22 trading days in which the ETF had moved 2%+ three times over a trailing five-day period. Those occurrences are shown on the chart below and they are clustered around three different periods - the Financial Crisis, the US debt downgrade in 2011, and the COVID crash. Needless to say, these were all very tumultuous periods in the markets and economy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/TLT-2-pct-plus-moves-080522.png))**

> Interestingly, there have been seven years since 2002 in which TLT has had less 2%+ percent daily moves than we have had in the last five days! For the entire year, this week's three occurrences take the total number of 2% daily moves for TLT to 17. There are still five months left in 2022, but if there wasn't another day with a gain or loss of 2%, this year would still rank fourth in terms of total 2%+ moves. Not only that, but if this year's pace were to continue, it would put 2022 on track for a record twenty-nine 2% moves, surpassing the prior record of 22 from 2011.

> The game is on as the market awaits tomorrow’s employment report and to see if the other shoe is going to drop on layoffs. Not to mention any deeper impact on the economy from inflation and the prospect of more aggressive rate increases from the Fed.

> We are taking the excitement over the renewed bullish sentiment with a grain of salt. There was a similar rise in bullish sentiment at the end March as that rally stalled just before the bottom fell out.

> Investors Intelligence Bulls/Bears Difference also rallied back above zero in late-March as it has the last few weeks. Red circles in the chart show comparable moves above zero during the 2008-2009 and 2015-2016 bears well before those bottoms.

> We may yet push a bit higher, but our cycles and indicators are still pointing to a retest of the June lows with the potential for a lower low before the bottom over the next three months.

***** 

> # Bulls Back Above 30%

> While the rally has paused today, the S&P 500 has continued to press higher in the past week and is currently hovering near resistance at the late May/early June highs. In response to those moves, investor sentiment has improved with the weekly survey from the AAII showing over 30% of respondents reporting as bullish. That is the highest reading since the first week of June when the S&P 500 was at similar levels to now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment is a similar story in hitting the lowest level since the first week of June as it has fallen back below 40%. The further 1.2 percentage point drop marks the fourth week in a row that bearish sentiment has fallen, and the full decline since the recent high of 59.3% on June 23rd now sits at over 20 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-2.png))**

> In spite of those further improvements, there continues to be more bears than bulls as the spread remains in negative territory. As shown in the second chart below, the bull bear spread has now been negative for 18 weeks in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-AAII-4.png))**

> In addition to the drop in bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment was also lower falling 1.6 percentage points down to 30.6%. That is the first time neutral sentiment matched bullish sentiment since May of last year.

> # Strongest July in Post-WWII Era

> On Friday, the S&P 500 closed over 140 basis points higher on the back of favorable earnings from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon (XOM). This was the third straight day in which the S&P 500 gained at least one percent, allowing bulls to breathe a sigh of relief after a tough start to the year. These moves came even as a second consecutive quarter of negative real GDP growth was reported and the Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points.

> Friday's move helped the S&P 500 post its best July in the post-WWII era, finishing with a gain of 9.2%. Although the index is still close to 14% off of its early January highs, the market looks more inviting than it did at the beginning of the month, when the YTD declines were above 20%. As investors, we could just give ourselves high fives for the month, but it's vital to remain forward-looking. Following July gains of 5%+, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.6% in August (median: +1.4%), performing positively 60 percent of the time. Between the start of August and the end of the calendar year, the index has averaged a gain of 8.0% (median: +10.0%), gaining 80% of the time. Over the following twelve months (starting in August), the index has averaged an impressive gain of 15.6% (median: +15.4%), rallying 87% of the time. Based on past history, bull runs in July tend to bode well for the market for both the rest of the year and over the following twelve months.

> # Rotating in August

> Following the best July of the post-WWII era, equities have been getting off to a slower start in August with the Russell 3,000 experiencing a modest decline yesterday and the index fighting to move into the green as of midday today. Most of the move to start August appears to a degree to be rotational in nature. In the chart below, we show the average performance of deciles of Russell 3,000 stocks grouped by their performance in the month of July. As shown, both the best and worst performers last month have rallied in early August with the deciles of the worst performers seeing slightly larger gains. The losers this month have been in the middle of the performance spectrum as deciles 4 through 7 are each flat to lower over the past couple of sessions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080222-Deciles-2.png))**

> Equities bottomed in mid-June and have been in rally mode ever since. As for how performance the past couple of days relates to the first half of the year's declines, again the worst performers have generally been outperforming. However, by this measure, the top performers from the 52-week high just after the New Year through the low in June have continued to fall this week.

> # Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ecae7fb5af7b0fc9e5eb39e8799d234f/bd4d1a07ef884772-d5/s500x750/5b86f230776c4ad0a11ef3b49b6f23b328aeeb36.jpg))**

> Inflation, war, recession fears, aggressive Fed rate hikes, lingering supply chain issues, layoffs, earnings misses, and lingering pandemic issues drove the market into official bear market territory last month.

> Driven by hopes of a soft landing, a resilient labor market, pockets of positive economic and corporate results, and some rather seriously oversold conditions in big name tech and growth stocks the market has rallied smartly off the June lows.

> At the end of July DJIA was up 9.9% from the June lows, S&P up 12.6% and NASDAQ up 16.4. Summer rally 2022 has worked the bulls into a frenzy like a matador with his red muleta. DJIA logged its 7th best July since 1950, up 6.7%, qualifying as a “Hot July Market.”

> Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of 7.2% on average in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year.

> # Initial Claims Back to the Highs

> Initial jobless claims came in matching expectations at 260K this week, up from last week's downward revision of 254K. That reading leaves claims 1K below the pandemic high set two weeks ago. Those levels are above the pre-pandemic range and consistent with where claims stood in the fall of 2017.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-1.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims have the benefit of seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year as the mid-summer peak works itself out. Given this, unadjusted claims have dropped to 205.6K from the high of 258.9K two weeks ago. Although that is a strong level of claims, it is above the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080422-Claims-2.png))**

> Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number meaning the most recent reading is as of the week of July 22nd. Although initial claims had fallen that week, continuing claims moved back above 1.4 million for the first time since mid-April. Unlike initial claims, and as we will discuss further in tonight's Closer, the deterioration in continuing claims has been relatively modest as current levels are not only well below levels from the two years pre-pandemic, but this week's reading would still make for some of the best readings since 1970.

# [Stock futures fall after Wednesday’s big market rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures slumped Thursday, putting the major averages on track to give back some of the sharp gains seen in the previous session.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones dropped 181 points, or 0.7%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
> The moves followed a broad rally for stocks a day earlier, as the Bank of England said it would purchase bonds in an effort to help steady its financial markets and the cratering British pound. Sterling has stooped to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent days.
*****
> It marked a stark shift from the aggressive tightening campaign many global central banks have undertaken to cope with surging inflation.
*****
> The Dow on Wednesday gained or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 2% after hitting a new bear market low on Tuesday. Both indexes snapped six-day losing streaks.
*****
> As stocks rose and the BOE shared its bond-buying plan, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped the most since 2020 after briefly topping 4%.
*****
> “We are skeptical that the calmer mood in markets on Wednesday marks an end to the recent period of elevated volatility or risk-off sentiment. For a more sustained rally, investors will need to see convincing evidence that inflation is coming under control, allowing central banks to become less hawkish,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Thursday note.
*****
> Wednesday’s rally put the major averages on pace to eke out small gains for the week, but they are still on track to cap off their worst month since June. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the monthly losses, down about 6.5%, while the Dow and S&P are on pace to close 5.8% and 5.9% lower, respectively.
*****
> On a quarterly basis, the Nasdaq is on track to break a two-quarter losing streak, while the Dow is headed for its third consecutive quarterly loss for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. The S&P is on pace for its third negative quarter in a row for the first time since its six-quarter negative streak that ended the first quarter of 2009.

#[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers.
*****
> Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points.
*****
> Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%.
*****
> The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week.
*****
> The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials.
*****
> However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don’t cool.
*****
> He referred to January’s big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports.
*****
> “If those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,” Waller said.
*****
> The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they’re relaying to the public.
*****
> “No matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‘communicate’ what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,” Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note.
*****
> “When markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent final trading day of this week ahead on this Friday, March 3rd, 2023! :)**"
149,"The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?",16,13yhq75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13yhq75/the_future_picks_and_shovels_of_ai_may_not_be/,3,1685724118.0,"For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now. 

I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.

Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.  

Years ago, a paper titled ""Attention is all you need"" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.  

Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy. 

Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# [Stock futures fall after S&P 500 hits new low for the year; 10-year Treasury yield briefly tops 4%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell Wednesday as traders struggle to find their footing after the S&P 500 notched a fresh bear market low in the previous session.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 57 points, or about 0.2%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid about 0.9%.
*****
> Shares of Apple were down nearly 4% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the tech company is ditching plans to increase new iPhone production after demand fell short of expectations.
*****
> Stock futures pared earlier losses after the Bank of England said it would temporarily purchase long-dated UK government bonds in an effort to stabilize the plunging British pound. Sterling briefly popped on the news before trading 0.5% lower against the dollar at $1.0647.
*****
> The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield gave back its initial gains after the announcement, last trading at about 3.93%. Earlier in the trading session, the benchmark rate broke above 4% for the first time since 2008.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session in which the S&P 500 reached a new bear market low of 3,623.29 and posted its sixth straight day of losses, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a gain.
*****
> Several technical metrics show that the stock market may be oversold, but some on Wall Street are worried that investors have not priced in an earnings slowdown and the impact of the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. The S&P 500 breaking below its previous low is a key indicator for some that stocks still have further to fall.
*****
> “I think we’re certainly not at the end of the road in terms of pricing in the full recessionary outcome. … We really need to get to dirt cheap valuations on equities, and we’re not quite there yet,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said on Tuesday’s “Closing Bell.”

153,Will the Cash App be the savior for Block struggling quarter?,14,136crot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/136crot/will_the_cash_app_be_the_savior_for_block/,6,1683096227.0," Block Inc. ($SQ), whose Cash App is among the world's top 10 payment apps, will probably report a seventh consecutive quarter of net losses as revenue growth settles at a rate below its pre-pandemic norm.  

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Block will likely report a first-quarter loss of -$0.18 per share vs. -$0.38 per share a year earlier.
* Revenue is predicted to climb more than 16% to $4.6 billion.
* Block's gross payment volume is expected to climb 17% to nearly $51 billion.

Block is forecast to post net losses of $111.8 million, or 18 cents a share, narrower than losses of over $207 million a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Analysts also predict revenue increased 16.5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion.1 Block reports earnings results after markets close Thursday.2

Block's transaction volumes surged in the second half of 2020 as e-commerce business swelled, but inflation and fears of a recession have quelled this rapid growth. Block's gross payment volume hasn't shrunk since 2020, but year-over-year growth has slowed from a peak of 88% in the second quarter of 2021 to 15% last quarter.

Block's Cash App is one of its primary growth drivers, and analysts expect revenue to top $2.8 billion, up from $2.5 billion a year ago.

CEO Jack Dorsey will likely face questions about a March 2023 report from short-seller Hindenburg Research accusing Block of inflating Cash App user counts.3 Block pushed back after the report was published, calling it ""factually inaccurate and misleading.""4

Dorsey could also report on efforts to expand Cash App's banking products, including the savings accounts it launched in January.5 The company and competitors like Apple ($AAPL) are adding traditional banking services to their platforms in an effort to retain users and become their primary banks. Big banks have responded in kind, with Bank of America ($BAC), JPMorgan ($JPM), and Wells Fargo ($WFC) reportedly developing a digital wallet of their own.  


Shares of Block are down almost 43% in the last year, while the benchmark S&P 500 Information Technology Index is up 5%."

&#x200B;

This guy is savvy, I have been mentioning this too.  We literally have the greatest crisis upon us no one is talking about.  

  
How google/Meta/ etc all make money.  Via ads.....and guess what the business model is collapsing. 

&#x200B;

Google is still an Ad company, so is meta, what worked for 10 + years is finally coming to an end.  The main thesis was self driving/AI would replace revenue but it hasn't

&#x200B;

Meta is scrambling now with the metaverse, they lost to Roblox.    


We might witness the greatest collapse in history only a few predicted.   

&#x200B;

who gets screwed? 

  
\-tik tokers

\-youtubers

\-free sites

Basically anyone selling you BS stuff you don't need.  While suck up a lot of capital but overall be good.

  
What happens when it collapses?  I think AAPL might be poised to pick up the pieces.......as they are shutting all this BS down with their opt out tracking etc.  

&#x200B;

Good luck!"

#[Stock futures slip after the S&P 500’s worst first half since 1970](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures slip Friday morning after the S&P 500 closed out its worst first-half performance in decades.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 122 points lower, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4%.
*****
> Micron Technology shares fell more than 4% in premarket trading on the back of disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter guidance.
*****
> Shares of Kohl’s fell 16% premarket after it cut its outlook for the fiscal second quarter, citing softer consumer spending, and terminated talks to sell its business, saying the retail environment has deteriorated since the beginning of its bidding process.
*****
> Thursday marked the end of the second quarter and the first half of the year. For the quarter, the S&P 500 fell more than 16% – its biggest one-quarter fall since March 2020. For the first half, the broader market index dropped 20.6% for its largest first-half decline since 1970. It also tumbled into bear market territory, down more than 21% from a record high set early January.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite were not spared from the onslaught. The 30-stock Dow lost 11.3% in the second quarter, putting it down more than 15% for 2022. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, suffered its biggest quarterly drop since 2008, losing 22.4%. Those losses pushed the tech-heavy composite deep into bear market territory, down nearly 32% from an all-time high set in November. It’s also down 29.5% year to date.
*****
> Those steep first-half and quarterly losses come as investors grapple with sky-high inflation and tighter monetary policy. The core personal consumption expenditures index – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 4.7% last month on a year-over-year basis. While that was slightly below a Dow Jones estimate, it was still near multidecade highs.
*****
> The Fed, in turn, has stepped up its efforts against the surge in prices, hiking by 0.75 percentage point in June. That was its biggest rate increase since 1994.
*****
> Both of these factors have resulted in escalating recession worries. First-quarter GDP contracted by 1.6%, and the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is pointing to another 1% decline in economic output for the second quarter.
*****
> “If we have any words of comfort, it is that universal losses at this pace rarely take place in successive quarters, but this is not the same as saying that further losses should not be anticipated,” wrote Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management. “This still very much looks to be the middle of the story, the period in which a previously ‘pacific’ outlook is replaced by something far stormier, and we are yet to see any signs that the weather is about to turn for the better.”
*****
> Traders will take in more economic data Friday, with the latest ISM manufacturing index and construction spending numbers set for release at 10 a.m. ET.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

156,What will your portfolio look like when this downtrend is over?,13,xdnf7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xdnf7i/what_will_your_portfolio_look_like_when_this/,60,1663115429.0,"We all are pretty much in agreement that today was a bad day in the stock market. I also think we all agree there is more pain to come. I would say by the end of September we are down another 10% in the broader market. Regardless if you disagree and think we will only be down another 5% or if you think we will be down another 20% I am curious of what your portfolios will look like when the hurting is over. If you do not mind me asking, when do you foresee the pain stopping? I am biased with my views because 80% of the time Q4 in the second year of a president's term are positive (for many reasons that do not need to be typed here).

Come early/mid October I plan to buy the following and this is what my portfolio will look like (this will be a set it and forget it portfolio since I am in my late twenties):

**25% VOO**

**20% TSLA**

**12% QQQ**

**15% SQ**

**12% SCHD**

**6% SOFI**

**3% AAPL**

**2% ASAN**

**\* Keeping 5% in cash at all times**

Yes, I know AAPL is already in some of the ETFs above. I want to own more of it that what is in my ETFs above. Tell me if I should add or take away anything? 

Edit: Right now I own almost nothing and my brokerage accounts are about 90% cash (own a few small cap stocks just to play with). I do not see a point in buying up VOO or anything above right now because why do so if another 10% downturn is basically guaranteed? "
157,"Fun strategy results: Buying stocks based on Dividend Yield TTM in my ""Funny-money"" portfolio",12,x9urr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x9urr9/fun_strategy_results_buying_stocks_based_on/,25,1662728032.0,"In  early 2020, I started my small portfolio for a simple ""fun"" strategy -   I pick stable big companies that pay dividends, but based on their  Dividend yield TTM.

Simply if the price of a company falls - then it's dividend yield rises. If the company can continue to pay it's dividends **(based on fundamental analysis)**  at an increasing rate, the price will adjust to it's median. Dividend  yield TTM is a ratio of share price to total payouts made over the last  12 months.

And this strategy  really surprised me - today my portfolio has 68% profit with 27% IRR and  2.8% yield on cost (1.7% dividend yield based on recent prices). And it  beats S&P500 return by 20% for 2 years!

[https://clip2net.com/clip/m0/5a597-clip-113kb.png](https://clip2net.com/clip/m0/5a597-clip-113kb.png)

To be honest, AAPL makes 50% of its profits. I love this company and the  way they do business. I recorded a dividend yield of 1.4% for myself.

UNH and FUN could be a better choice, as history shows.

The next buy I think will be INTC, because only that bastard has negative returns in my portfolio and 10 year max div yield.

What do you think? Could this strategy be consistent, or it's just luck and good timing?

158,"Inflation coming in lighter than expected is likely to be a Bearish indicator, especially in the short term",15,zl9nx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zl9nx0/inflation_coming_in_lighter_than_expected_is/,58,1670971822.0,"**Edit:** Down votes are totally fair for this opinion. I was just hoping to get some contrarian views as well. 

For all of 2022, the Fed has been doing their best to increase rates to try and get inflation under control. It looks like we're starting to make some progress as inflation is slowing as seen by today's report and to some degree, the past few reports.

Markets Rejoice!

But not so fast. A reduction in the month to month inflation is great and something that in the long run will be good. But what does inflation coming in below expectations mean for stocks?

A lower rate of inflation means that there are either less than expected dollars chasing the same amount of things, or it could mean there are more things out there with the same amount of dollars. Either way, it means that some or all companies could see less revenue increases or even lower revenue than estimated if we start to see deflation throughout the economy.

If the above happens, we'll start to see the next leg down in the market as earnings compress. I obviously don't have a crystal and can't say for certain it will happen but based on the Fed's actions, I personally think we haven't gotten out of this bear market quite yet.

Here are the reasons why I think we're likely to see that happen next:

1. Real average hourly earnings increased only .5% MoM and are DOWN 1.9% YoY (per the CPI report
2. Food prices rose .5% MoM and are up 10.6% YoY (I would argue this is a good that is not super elastic)
3. Shelter costs are up .6% MoM (again, I would argue this is not a super elastic good)
4. The price of goods like used cars is down 2.9% MoM and services like medical services cost declined .7% MoM.

All that is to say that we're starting to see people making less, spend less on goods and services, while continuing to spend more on goods that they HAVE TO spend on, ie shelter and food; potentially giving them even less disposable income to spend on other things.

Furthermore, from Powell's last FOMC speech, he made it clear that the markets are not fully pricing in how high rate hikes could go and that they are not likely to stop/reduce them anytime soon.

In my opinion, only when we start to see the unemployment rate go up markedly can we assume that the bear market is likely at the end, as the fed stops and reduces rates and companies start to increase their earnings again.

In the mean time, I've been continuing to add tech, especially the big boys such as aapl, amzn, googl, etc. I don't how much further we fall or if we even fall at all but I do think Big Tech is still the way of the future.

With that said, I think whatever recession and earnings decline we see will be mild to moderate as far as stocks are concerned due to many of the big player's strength coming out of covid.

159,AAPL: the last big tech to result. Bump higher or haircut?,14,w9qycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9qycf/aapl_the_last_big_tech_to_result_bump_higher_or/,27,1658958268.0,"Really curious to see how this one goes. All big tech have missed so far but obviously went up anyways. The thing I see about MSFT, GOOGL, META is that they’re not consumer driven like Apple and may be somewhat more immune to inflation and recession fears than Apple, which does have services, but are not as big a piece of the pie. 

Apple is gone up near vertical over the past month in the face of an onslaught of bad news. It sits at a 2.5 trillion market cap. The other aforementioned tech stocks have fallen from their highs but not Apple. In fact, it’s only about 10% from its ATH, which I think is absolutely insane given all that’s happened over the past year and half. 

So what do you think earnings will bring? Will the Apple spree continue even in the face of a miss? Really curious to see your thoughts."

Is there a ETF screener that will spit out ETFs that have the stocks I am interested in holding ideally with a decent amount of weight in said ETF.

1) Aapl
2) Mcd
3) Pepsi
4) ABT &ABBV
5) JNJ
6) MSFT
7) WMT
8) GOOG/Googl

1-3 I would love to have all 3 be a large contributor in an ETF. 

4-8: I would love to have all of these be weighted as close as possible to each other.

Edit: For anyone wondering the same thing , I decided to buy individual stocks instead of and ETF. Paying a high MER for an ETf that I liked the portfolio and weighting of is annoying and unnecessary. I like selling “safe covered calls” so this works out well.

ETFchannel was a godsend for getting to this decision since they have a tool that searches for the desired stocks with their total weighting."
161,Apple (AAPL): A Critical Perspective on Their Financial Performance and AI Development,10,13qu32f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13qu32f/apple_aapl_a_critical_perspective_on_their/,6,1684954203.0,"Apple's recent financial performance and position in the AI industry have raised some red flags. Despite generating significant revenue, Apple's gross margin percentage has seen a decline, and its heavy spending on share buybacks might suggest a lack of better investment opportunities.  
Additionally, while Apple has been investing in AI, they seem to be falling behind. Their acquisitions in the field haven't yet translated into significant progress, which may suggest difficulties in integrating these acquisitions or a lack of strategic focus.  
It's crucial for us to keep a critical eye on these developments. What are your thoughts"
162,XLG vs S&P 500,9,yn6k59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yn6k59/xlg_vs_sp_500/,21,1667683320.0,"I was curious about people’s thoughts on investing in XLG (Invesco S&P 500® Top 50 ETF) instead of a index that tracks the full S&P 500 (VOO or SPY).

XLG tracks only the top 50 so it’s a lot more concentrated:

• VOO’s top 10 accounts for 27% 

• XLG’s top 10 accounts for 52%

• AAPL in VOO is 6.88%

• AAPL in XLG is 13.12%

My thought process here is that I’m young enough (early 20s) to take on the risk of being more heavily concentrated with the hopes that the top dogs of the S&P will outperform the bottom 450. I’d love to hear what people think of this idea. I know people say it’s hard to beat the S&P but this seems like a way to just play the S&P but with more risk/reward."

Through what mechanism would this phenomenon occur?"

# [S&P 500 futures rise as China Covid concerns ease](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Futures connected to the S&P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
> The broad index’s futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
> The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people “over age 80” had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
> Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country’s zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
> “There’s some real reasons to be cautious. The market’s rallied a lot this quarter, and there’s some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it’s a kind of balanced risk reward,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “I think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,” he added.
*****
> On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.
*****
> Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings on Wednesday. Investors will be listening for insight into the central bank’s fight against inflation.

> **Hibbett (HIBB)** – The sporting goods retailer’s stock slid 5.7% in the premarket after it missed top and bottom line estimates for its latest quarter. Hibbett was hit by higher expenses which cut into its profit margins, although the company reaffirmed its full-year forecast.

Such that right at the time the market opens I can have all the data I want, accurately and instant, downloaded to my server.

I have attempted use over multiple APIs including Yahoo, RapidAPI and more. I even tried using ibkr.

The issue I couldn't solve:  
All the APIs tend to have instant and correct data about current stock price, bid and ask and so on.

However, it tends to be that way on large enterprises such as AAPL and so on. For small stocks it's sadly inaccurate. Perhaps I am missing something Nasdaq has to offer, if I am please let me know. If you know of any service I could use I'd be glad and thankful."

Do you guys know of an API (can be paid) which provides

1. Earnings estimates i.e. forecasted EPS consensus, # of estimates etc.,
2. Up to date quarterly earnings data submitted by the company

Surprisingly, I checked Alpha Vantage API for this but JPM earnings that were submitted last week aren't there (using free key). I checked free yfinance API and JPM quarterly earnings are there but only revenue and earnings. I'm checking now some paid options like EODHD but they seem to lack #1. Ugh. Quite new to coding. Using Python.

Thanks in advance

EDIT:

1. **EODHD** has this data and quite a bit more though it costs for me 49.99 EUR per month for fundamental data ONLY. One can check the sample for AAPL [https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/fundamentals/AAPL.US?api\_token=demo](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/fundamentals/AAPL.US?api_token=demo)
2. **IEXCLOUD** seem to have this data as well but haven't tested yet [https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#earnings](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#earnings)"

Scenario:  
$10,000 account  
On Monday I sell $10,000 worth of AMZN to purchase $10,000 of AAPL  
On Tuesday I sell all shares of AAPL to purchase $10,000 of TSLA  
On Wednesday, I sell all TSLA shares to purchase $10,000 of GOOG

In this scenario, I would incur a good faith violation, correct? Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?

Most of my accounts are margin accounts, but I have 1 non-margin account that I am interested in doing this type of daily swing trading in and I'm trying to understand how good faith violations work and if this is possible without incurring violations.

Thanks!"

At the end of the quarter, let's say I should get 10 bucks from dividends from those companies. However, since the fund is accumulating, where does the money go exactly? People say it's used to buy more shares of the fund, however, I never saw my shares actually increase. Others say the value of the share itself just goes up by a bit, how is this possible if the underlying stocks of the fund is not changed?

Any help would be appreciated!"

The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:

GOOGL 2.28%

META 1.92%

MSFT 1.78%

AMZN 1.39%

AAPL 0.26%

The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.

One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point. On the contrary, if the big rising stocks are still 30% to 40% off from the historical high, and the p/e is very low, they are still very cheap."

*****
> Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.
*****
> Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender’s credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses.
*****
> “I think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic — it’s simply confused,” said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. “The price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.”
*****
> Ball added that Deutsche Bank is “very sound financially.”
*****
> “It could be crippled if there’s a big loss of confidence and there’s a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.”
*****
> European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed.
*****
> Investors continued to assess the Fed’s latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy.
*****
> On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures.
*****
> “Retail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That’s dangerous,” Ball added. “Banks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.”

> # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low

> We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**

> Taking a look at current S&P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**

> On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.

Although the S&P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.

> One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.

> The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.

> # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes

> The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**

> Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we’ve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give “guidance” that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.

> Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.

> # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything
> The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.

> Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.

> This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.

> Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed’s March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions “substitute” for rate hikes.

> # There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead
> While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:

> * How big will the impact be?

> * How long will the impact last?

> These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.

> Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don’t expect rate cuts this year.

> Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**

> There’s clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:

> * Market expectations move higher – if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don’t look to be tightening significantly.

> * Fed expectations move lower – if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.

> Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It’s going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.

> # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?

> Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**

> In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**

> While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.

> # A Fed Day Like Most Others

> Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.

> The S&P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**

> So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.

> It’s been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank’s stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**

> # Why is this happening?
> The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.

> # Why this matters to investors?
> The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we’re in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.

> Maybe it’s an overreaction as “banking crisis” headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn’t a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.

> # FANG+ Flying

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**

> Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&P 500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**

> More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.

> # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned

> It’s encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.

> Last week’s gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.

> The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&P is down 27 of the last 40 year – and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.

> In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it’s a good time to remember Warren Buffet’s wise words to “Be greedy when others are fearful.”

> Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.

> # Nasdaq Leaves the S&P in the Dust

> Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**

> Historically, the major indices, namely the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**

> Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).

174,Perspective matters - comparing swing trading vs buy and hold in between 2002 and 2022,8,x1vhv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x1vhv0/perspective_matters_comparing_swing_trading_vs/,11,1661895982.0,"I will make this post short and to the point: Good luck trying to beat the market by doing day or swing trading. I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know - not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. 

Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in ***May 2002*** that AAPL would be dipping from its high of **$0.45** we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to **$0.33** in ***July 2002.*** Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002 - yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt, but maybe not. 

Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1,000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today, even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. 

We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing, ETFs, since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks (including myself). Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure, SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should ""would have been nice to have sold then"". . . ***April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87.*** 

My point with this post is simple: Buy, hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY, VOO and QQQ and don't touch them for decades. Hell, don't even look at them. 

Current positions: 

40% in SPY/VOO/QQQ ; 10% in SCHD ; 10% in VT ; 9% in AAPL ; 8% in GOOG ; 8% in SOFI ; 6% in TSLA ; 5% NVDA ; Approx. 4% remaining in cash. 

Buy. 

Hold. 

Live your life."
175,Think I nailed the Q1/Q2 market maker swings,5,11ywqvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11ywqvs/think_i_nailed_the_q1q2_market_maker_swings/,24,1679519330.0,"Macro events aside , think I just nailed my Q1 /Q2 thesis on the market maker swings

Been sizing this up since Jan 1 (drops ) and then the Quad Witch of Jan 21 (1st fake rally) . It helped me develop a theory that allowed me to nail the swings today .

Theory : 
- Triple and Quad witch index  call options that opened middle of last year were bought en masse by the banks . Those dates are key, because the banks will win on those bets .  That’s March 17, June 16, and Sept 15 . 

- The near and mid term options that opened shortly after the Quad Witch Day , that are in between that day and the next Quad Witch are a bank hedge, and a retail trap. Between SPY and QQQ…the bigs are typically the wealthy ones with enough shares in holdings to sell fresh call options . They are the seller of these fresh, near term options . 

- CPI and PPI and fed rate dates happen in between . General market consensus Forrest-through-trees is 2024 is latest for market to recover (Those are the nearest term calls available after September btw ). 

- If the market trades sideways first half of the year , max pain for retail is down/flat during the in- between weeks of quad witch . That means retail loses on those fresh, less expensive calls that suddenly open during a rally . Bigs collect time premium . They sell old shares to aid the process . 

- Retail either sells at a partial or total loss, or jumps to next week waiting on the recovery . 

- Bigs then use fresh profits from collecting time premium (selling all of us stupid retailers the near term calls ), and average back into their holdings for a quad witch rally . That was this las few trading days . 


What I did :

- I’m not into charts but Nasdaq clearly has its resistance points at the major spots (e.g. 11k,11.5k,12k, etc ) 

- I bought calls on the last false rally for March 21. I closed some green (SPY and DAPP),  exercised a few, left a couple open (AAPL and Etsy) , and I sold out slowly of the cash call. I had a couple days to watch for the fresh calls to open for the weeks before the next big month available (April 21 has been open for a bit ). 

- That day was Friday and Today …..fresh calls available for cheap during a big spike . I sold AAPL and ETSY cheap and trimmed into mutuals . 

- When Nasdaq crossed 12k I reversed and bought calls near term calls for the inverse ETFs on all broad indexes (FAZ, SQQQ, SARK, SRS)


I effectively made money on both sides testing this theory …..although my technicals are certainly imperfect . I plan on rinse and repeating until June .

176,Portfolio critique,6,10wii4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10wii4g/portfolio_critique/,11,1675817207.0,"Background first: I am a 20m college student with \~1000 in a roth and \~6500 in taxable (mostly from gifts). I have been investing since 2020 and have definitely learned some hard lessons along the way. The past 1.5 years I have greatly shifted focus from a quick buck to planning on never selling. Most of my taxable account is individual stocks with 10-30+ year outlook. Moving forward, all of my focus will be on my roth until I have 401k/trad IRA/have income above roth. I have followed this and other subs closely for a while and tried to learn as much as I can. I currently have my roth split across 5 funds which I want to ask about and be critiqued on. 

All portfolio % based on 15-20 year timeframe, but will reallocate as I learn and change with time

1: SCHD, planning for 20-30% of my portfolio

2: VOOG, I have high risk tolerance as a young person and thus have chosen VOOG over VOO/VTI. Goal is 30-40% of portfolio

3:RWL: This acts as my exposure to value stocks, an S&P500 fund weighted by revenue rather than a traditional ""value"" fund. Goal 10-20%

4: ANGL: Bond exposure, still learning lots about this market. But I felt this was good initial choice to provide diversified corporate bond exposure and fixed income 10% goal

5: IYK: consumer staples ETF, consumer staples have a history of outperforming the market during periods of economic downturn. Exposure to this sector provides a nice buffer. 10% goal

With time I plant to add a limiting number of individual stocks, depending on timing, it would be no more than 15% of my portfolio, but my rough list is as follow: AAPL, F, KO, TM, UNH, COST, WMT, TGT, MSFT, MMM

As I near retirement I would rebalance my portfolio primarily through shedding individual stock as well as VOOG for either more SCHD, VOO, or VOOV.

Looking for any critiques and criticisms so I can continue to learn!"

The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
> Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

> # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

> It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

> In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

> # Let’s Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

> As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&P 500 are rarer than you may think.

> If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don’t see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

> Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

> * The year after, a negative return saw the S&P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
> * A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
> * Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
> * However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
> * Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

> # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

> “It’s not what you look at that matters; it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau

> I’ve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let’s be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

> The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

> You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.” We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

> What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

> That’s right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don’t hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

> Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

> # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

> As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

> For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

> Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

> As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

> As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

> # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

> Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as “year ends make great exits,” a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000’s record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

> # Country ETFs in 2022

> Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

> With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

> In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

> # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

> January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

> DJIA and S&P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 & 2021 as DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

> However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

> # Falling FAANG+

> Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

> NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

> Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

> With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

# **Dow sheds more than 100 points Friday, but notches fourth straight positive week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday, but was headed for a positive week, as investors assessed a weak retail sales report that dented enthusiasm around a stronger-than-expected start to corporate earnings.
*****
> The 30-stock Dow dropped 143.22 points, or about 0.42%, to 33,886.47. The S&P 500 fell 0.21% to 4,137.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.35% to 12,123.47.
*****
> The Dow, however, notched its fourth-straight positive week, rising 1.2%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, meanwhile, nabbed their fourth positive week in five. The broad-market index added 0.79% for the week, while the Nasdaq ticked higher by 0.29%.
*****
> Advance retail sales in March showed consumer spending fell twice as much as expected. Retail sales declined by 1% last month, more than the 0.5% drop expected by economists polled by Dow Jones, in part because consumers paid less for fuel.
*****
> “Retail sales came in weaker than expected, but a lot of the miss had to do with lower gas prices, which all things being equal is a slight positive for spending,” wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Inflation has been coming down as gas prices have been coming down, but that can reverse in an instant, which would drive the headline numbers higher. What is more concerning is that core (which excludes food and gas prices) has been stubbornly high – and where we believe the risks to higher-rates-for-longer lie,” Zaccarelli added.
*****
> The disappointing retail sales data offset excitement around strong corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase reported record revenue that beat analysts’ expectations, with the stock rising more than 7%. Wells Fargo shares briefly rose as much as 2.1% after the bank reported growing profits, before closing about flat. These were the first bank earnings since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month.
*****
> Elsewhere, UnitedHealth, which has the biggest weighting in the Dow, fell 2.7% after what Mizuho described as a “modest beat and raise.” The action came after UnitedHealth said it’s spending more for new diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.
*****
> Meanwhile, Boeing closed lower by more than 5%. On Thursday, the aircraft maker warned of delivery delays for some of its 737 Max planes.
*****
> Expectations for this earnings season are downbeat. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect S&P 500 earnings fell more than 5% in the first quarter. That forecast comes as companies deal with persistent inflation and higher rates.
*****
> “The bar has never been set lower,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. “My guess is with consensus expectations for the S&P 500 to show earnings that are down some 5%, that may well be overstating what we actually find out.”
*****
> “I think that what’s going to be super important is the kind of guidance we get, and how confident that corporations will be in guiding for the next three quarters in the face of what likely will be a slower economy.”
*****
> Investors also assessed two back-to-back reports this week signaling cooling inflation. The March producer price index, a measure of prices paid by companies, declined 0.5% from the prior month, even as economists polled by Dow Jones expected prices to stay the same. Excluding food and energy, the index shed 0.1% from the prior month, while economists estimated a 0.2% month-to-month increase.
*****
> The PPI, which is considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation, bolstered a trend of easing inflation seen in the March consumer price index report released Wednesday. Consumer prices grew 5% on an annual basis, which was the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly two years.

> # Three More Bullish Signals The Bears Don’t Want To See

> “If you don’t know where you want to get to….it doesn’t matter which way you go.” -The Cheshire Cat to Alice in Alice in Wonderland.

> Stocks have continued to stage an impressive rally off the mid-March lows, so much so that we have now seen multiple rare and potentially bullish signals trigger. Today, I’ll take a look at three of these signals. Yes, by itself any one of these signals could be noise, but when you start stacking them on top of each other, like the Cheshire Cat said in the quote above, stocks likely want to go higher and we should be ready to know where they could head.

> First up, the S&P 500 had it’s best first quarter since 2019, up 7.0%, which came on the heels of 7.1% gain the quarter before. What happened after previous big first quarters? I found there were 16 other first quarters that gained at least 5% and the final three quarters of the year finished higher 15 times. Yes, the one year that didn’t work was 1987 and when people hear that year, they start to get worried. Well, stocks were up 40% for the year in August back then, so we’ll worry about having another 1987 if we see returns like that (which we don’t expect). Until then, this is another clue the bulls could have a nice 2023.

> Next, we’ve heard a lot how only a few stocks are leading the overall markets higher. We don’t fully agree there and one way to show this is there was a recent sign of extreme buying pressure across many sectors and stocks. Using data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, more than 93% of the stocks in the NDR universe were recently above their 10-day moving average. All you need to know here is this is a rare sign of broad-based strength and a year later stocks were higher 23 out of 24 times with some very solid returns along the way.

> Lastly, Marty Zweig is known as one of the best traders ever and he coined the Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) indicator many years ago. Well, we just saw a rare trigger of this potentially bullish signal. To keep it simple, this signal looks at all the stocks on the NYSE and it looks for periods of extreme oversold periods moving to periods of extremely overbought in a short timeframe. Think of it as a washout and then heavy buying coming in, which tends to open the door to higher prices.

> The table below shows the previous 14 ZBTs and what happened next. Wouldn’t you know it, but the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time. That is 14 out of 14 and up 23.3% on average. Sure, the sample size isn’t probably as large as we’d like to consider this statistically relevant, but I’d sure rather know this than ignore it.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-3-800x755.png))**

> Finally, here’s a chart showing the ZBTs. Sometimes a picture tells the story and one look at this, and it would be quite rare for this signal to trigger and for stocks to simply drop right back to new lows. In fact, usually it happens ahead of periods of strength.

> # First Republic and Other Banks See Large Jumps in Short Interest

> Short interest figures get published every two weeks, and movements in short interest are a helpful way to gauge bull/bear positioning on individual names as well as groups and sectors. When a stock has a high percentage of shares sold short, it means that a lot of investors are betting against it. If a highly-shorted company manages to produce better than expected results, however, shares will often see outsized gains as many of those shorts rush to cover.

> With bank failures and deposit flight emerging in March, causing two S&P 500 bank stocks to fail and many other regional bank stocks to fall precipitously, we were interested to see how short interest levels changed during the month. End-of-month short interest figures for March were just recently published, and below is a table showing stocks in the S&P 1500 that saw the biggest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) during the month.

> As shown, the two stocks that saw the biggest increases in short interest were First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW). At the end of February, FRC only had 2.71% of its float sold short, but by the end of March, that figure had spiked to 29.51%. PacWest's jump in short interest was slightly less extreme, but it was extreme nonetheless, rising from 3.59% up to 20.56% in March. Another nine Financials are on the list of the 30 S&P 1500 stocks that saw the biggest jumps in SIPF in March, while another five REITs made the list as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/changesipf.png))**

> Below is a better look at just how much short interest spiked for First Republic (FRC) in March. While the bank did see a mini-spike in late 2018 when the broader market was struggling with another batch of Fed tightening, FRC's short interest normally sits between 0-5% of float. Now it's up to nearly 30%. For a stock that's down 94% from its highs, where do you think the risk/reward lies at this point?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/frcfloat.png))**

> In terms of the most heavily shorted stocks, only Big Lots (BIG) currently has a higher percentage of its float sold short than FRC in the S&P 1500.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/sp1500short.png))**

> Below is a chart showing the average change in SIPF for stocks in the S&P 1500 by industry group in the month of March. As shown, the Banks saw the biggest average jump at 0.78 ppts, followed by Telecom Services, Media & Entertainment, and REITs. Stocks in the Consumer Durables & Apparel group saw the largest decline in SIPF at -0.23 ppts.

> # Sentiment: Back to the 20s

> Whereas last week saw a huge rebound in bullish sentiment after the S&P 500's breakout above March highs, the more listless price action of the past week resulted in a modest turnaround in sentiment. The latest AAII sentiment survey showed only 26.1% of respondents reported as bullish compared to the recent high of 33.3% last week. The 7.2 percentage point decline was the largest one-week drop in bulls since the last week of February when it declined by 12.5 percentage points. That leaves bullish sentiment right in the middle of the range since the start of 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment fell, without any considerable push lower for the S&P 500, bearish sentiment went little changed falling just half of one percentage point down to 34.5%. Like last week, that remains the lowest reading since the week of February 16th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-2.png))**

> That means that all of the declines in bullish and bearish sentiment flowed to the neutral camp with a surge of 7.9 percentage points; the largest one-week increase since the first week of the year. At 39.5%, neutral sentiment is at the high end of the past few years' range and only 0.3 percentage points below the late February high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-4.png))**

> The AAII survey was not the only sentiment reading to take a more bearish tone this week. The NAAIM Exposure index's latest release today showed investment managers reduced equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey's bull-bear spread has actually continued to rise resulting in the highest reading since the first week of 2022. Additionally, as we noted in Monday's Chart of the Day, the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index went unchanged in March after rebounding in the proceeding few months. In other words, across multiple readings, sentiment has improved but has yet to definitively shift to bullish.

> # The Good, The Bad, The Inflation

> The March inflation report showed that CPI inflation rose only 0.1%, slightly below expectations. Over the past year, inflation is now up 5%, well off the peak 9% from June 2022. As you can see below, the big driver of lower inflation has been energy and food.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-headline-CPI-662x800.png))**

> Energy makes up about 7% of the “inflation basket”, split almost equally into commodities (like gasoline) and services (like electricity and piped gas). Thanks to the pullback in oil prices, energy commodity prices are now below where they were in December 2021. The recent drop in natural gas prices has also sent services prices lower over the past couple of months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-energy-prices-800x660.png))**

> Further good news: prices for “food at home”, i.e. groceries, fell 0.3% in March. This is the first price decline since September 2020, and bodes well even for prices and restaurants and such (which are still elevated).

> # Lower energy and food prices are a big deal, for consumption
> Lower inflation, by way of lower energy and food prices, means “real” incomes, i.e. incomes adjusted for inflation, remain strong. More so if the labor market remains healthy, which looks to be the case as we wrote the other day.

> The chart below shows annualized growth rates of disposable income, employee compensation (across all workers in the economy), and inflation. Over the past 3, 6 and 12 months, disposable income has run ahead of inflation. Part of this is because social security incomes got a big inflation-adjusted boost in January. But even employee compensation is running ahead of inflation. That’s really positive for consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the economy.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-DPI-vs-comp-vs-inflation-602x800.png))**

> # The big story: Housing inflation may finally be turning (lower)
> Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% in March. Over the past 3 months, core inflation is up 5.1% (annualized pace) and its up 5.6% over the past year. So, not much of a slowdown.

> Part of the reason is that housing inflation has been running high.

> But we got very good news on that front. Rents of primary residences and owners’ equivalent rent (rental equivalent of owner-occupied homes) rose “only” 0.5%. While still high, that pace is the slowest monthly increase in a year. Over the past 9 months, housing inflation averaged about +0.7% per month, which translates to a whopping 9% annualized rate!

> So, the slowdown in March is significant, and most welcome.

> Of course, as we’ve written about in the past, we’ve already seen a sharp deceleration in market rents. It’s just that the official inflation data has been really slow to catch up to that reality. But that may be changing now and bodes well for core inflation to slow down across the rest of this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-rents-market-vs-official-599x800.png))**

> # The bad news: Core inflation ex housing remains elevated
> That was the good news, i.e. a slowdown in energy, food and housing inflation. However, the rest of it still looks to be elevated.

> For one thing, vehicle prices are no longer falling as fast as they were. Vehicle prices, especially for used cars, was another big factor in pulling inflation lower over the last few months. Used car prices fell 0.9% in March, but that’s the smallest decline in 7 months. Private data suggests that used car prices are rising again. New vehicle prices also rose 0.4%, breaking a recent downward trend.

> Outside of vehicles, a lot of goods and services that were initially hit by the pandemic are still seeing significant price increases. These include goods like household furnishings and apparel, and services like hotels and airlines fares.

> Even beyond that, services such as day care, personal care, and recreation, are seeing inflation running well above what we saw before the pandemic.

> All of which is a sign that demand for these goods and services remains strong.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-supercore-select-items-inflation-601x800.png))**

> # What does this mean for the Fed?
> Fed officials have explicitly said that they want to see core services ex housing decelerate. In short, they’re looking at inflation excluding energy, food and housing, the three categories where we’ve had positive news. Unfortunately, there’s not much evidence that this slice of the inflation basket is decelerating, yet. The good news is that it tends to be correlated to wage growth, and there’s strong evidence that wage growth is moving closer to what we saw pre-pandemic.

> Now, the Fed is unlikely to continue raising interest rates much further from here, especially since we had a banking crisis, and they may want to play cautious. Plus, as we wrote a few weeks ago, banks tightening credit in response to the crisis is akin to rate increases.

> At the same time, they are likely to keep rates where they are until they see convincing evidence of inflation falling, especially core services ex housing inflation.

> This is not what investors expect. Instead, investors expect the Fed to start cutting rates in late summer, pricing in at least 3 rate cuts by the end of 2023. Indicating that bond investors believe a crisis or recession is likely in the near-term. That’s clearly not where Fed officials are right now. We’re not there either, for now.

> Eventually, market pricing and Fed officials’ views must converge. In the meantime, expect volatility, especially in the bond market.

> # 10-Year 10-Baggers

> Peter Lynch's 1989 book One Up On Wall Street introduced investors to the word ""ten bagger,"" which represents an investment that appreciates by 10x (1,000%) its initial purchase price.

> Today we wanted to highlight the stocks that have been ""ten baggers"" over the last ten years. In the Russell 1,000, 33 names are up more than 1,000% since April 12th, 2013. Over the same 10-year period, the S&P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) is up 211%. As shown below, NVIDIA (NVDA) is up the most with a gain of 8,833%, followed by Tesla (TSLA) at 6,304% and then Plug Power (PLUG) at 5,477%.

> There are 16 Technology stocks on the list of 33 ten baggers, which is the most of any sector. Other Tech stocks on the list include AMD, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Broadcom (AVGO), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX), and even the two largest stocks in the US - Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Netflix (NFLX) is also another notable on the list with a gain of 1,266%.

> Some other notables include Industrials stocks like Axon -- the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, Industrials stocks like Builders FirstSource (BLDR) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL), and Vince VcMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is set to be bought by Endeavor Group (EDR).

> Stocks that are already up 1,000%+ over the last ten years seem unlikely to repeat that over the next ten years. The obvious next question is: which stocks will be ten baggers over the next ten years? As Peter Lynch instructed, you'll have to do your research!

> # 3 Small Business Outlook Cratering

>  Small business optimism continued to decline in March with the headline index from the NFIB falling from 90.9 down to 90.1. That headline reading was actually better than the consensus forecast of 89.3, but it was still in the bottom decile of the indicator's historical range dating back to 1986.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB.png))**

> Looking across individual categories, breadth was weak in the report with only three indices moving higher month over month, three going unchanged, and all the others falling. As with the headline number, many categories are also historically depressed in the bottom decile of readings including a record low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-2.png))**

> That record low was in the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand. Only 2% reported now as a good time to expand, down 4 points month over month. Albeit the reading has been at the low end of its historical range for much of the past year, March's reading matched the historical low form March 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-4.png))**

> Given the small business outlook for the economy has soured, fewer firms are reporting plans to increase hiring or capital expenditures. In fact, the index for capex plans fell to 20, which alongside March 2021, is the lowest reading since the spring of 2020. Similarly, hiring plans are at new lows for the post-pandemic period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-3.png))**

> One factor likely impacting business plans has been financial conditions. The most pronounced decline of any category last month was a record 4-point decline in the availability of loans. While the reading has been rolling over for some time, that drop leaves the index at the lowest level since December 2012.

> # Inflation Concerns Continue to Ease

> In an earlier post, we mentioned the record-low reading in the percentage of small businesses perceiving now as a good time to expand. As for what these firms perceive to be their most pressing issues, inflation continues to be the single most prevalent answer at 24%, albeit the gap has narrowed dramatically. Quality of labor is now only a single percentage point behind at 23%, and when combined with cost of labor, the two issues account for over a third of small businesses' biggest problems. From a historical standpoint, those three readings all remain elevated and account for a massive share of the most pressing issues facing small businesses.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

> The four percentage point drop month over month in the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue is the largest decline since January when it had fallen 6 percentage points. As a result, the category is only down to the lowest level since January 2022 which remains well outside the range of pre-pandemic readings. In other words, inflation appears to be improving compared to last July when it was top of mind for 37% of small businesses, but it is still nowhere near a non-issue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

> Picking up some of those losses has been government-related concerns. This series has historically held a political bias in which under Republican administrations small businesses are less concerned with red tape and taxes and vice versa during Democratic administrations. With the surge in inflation concerns during President Biden's tenure, this index has remained historically low but has begun to rise more recently as inflation has improved.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

> Another area to see a rise in firms reporting it as their biggest problem has been poor sales. While the reading is far from flying, it has begun trending higher accounting for 5% of responses in March. That pairs with the index for actual reported sales changes which have remained firmly negative for nearly a year now.

> # 2023 Still Tracking Pre-Election Year Pattern But Gains May Be Muted

> Despite the recent selloff and volatility S&P 500 still tracks typical pre-election year market trends. However, uncertainties about rates, inflation, recession, banking and economic growth are likely to mute the usual pre-election year gains. A debt ceiling standoff could keep stocks under pressure during the Worst Six Months May-October.

179,"Dow Jones futures rise; a sale at Silicon Valley Bank closes; Microsoft, Tesla near buy points",5,123d6ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/123d6ws/dow_jones_futures_rise_a_sale_at_silicon_valley/,3,1679896638.0,"Dow Jones futures rose slightly Sunday night, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The bank crisis is still in focus. Headlines have been relatively modest so far this weekend, though a deal may be close for FDIC-controlled Silicon Valley Bank.

A stock market rally attempt is ongoing, but the indexes have been volatile while breadth has been narrow.

The major indexes rose modestly for the week, but came far off weekly highs. The Russell 2000 hit 2023 lows with bank stocks, but small caps and banks edged up for the week.

The rally attempt has relied heavily on big-cap Nasdaq stocks. Apple stock,  Microsoft ($MSFT), Tesla ($TSLA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ($REGN), MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) are Nasdaq 100 stocks that are holding up well.

REGN stock gapped up into a buy zone late in the week on positive drug trial news. Apple ($AAPL) and Microsoft are just above buy points while Palo Alto is just below an entry. MercadoLibre and Tesla stock are holding key support levels, not far from being actionable. All boast strong relative strength lines. MercadoLibre and PANW stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AAPL stock is on SwingTrader. MSFT stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. MELI stock is on the IBD 50. 

Just because individual stocks are possible buys doesn't mean investors have to act on them. This market rally attempt still needs to confirm its uptrend. 

## Bank News

This weekend has been relatively quiet for banking news, at least in comparison to the prior two weekends. The news generally has been about resolution vs. frantic efforts to avoid systemic collapse.

First Citizens BancShares is in advanced talks to buy SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported Sunday evening.

The FDIC has been looking to unload Silicon Valley Bank since taking over more than two weeks ago. Reports last week suggested that the regulator might shoulder some of the underwater assets to smooth the way for a deal.

U.S. regulators could expand an emergency lending facility for banks, with an aim at helping First Republic bolster its balance sheet, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing sources. Authorities are mulling various options. They don't see any First Republic as needing urgent new help as the California-based bank tries to work out solutions with its advisers.

Late Friday, the Fed reported that deposits at small domestically chartered banks fell by $120 billion in the week March 15, but rose $67 billion at large domestically chartered banks.

On Friday, many banks rebounded from 2023 lows after concerns expanded, at least briefly, to Deutsche Bank. Even Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley undercut recent lows before closing better.

The video embedded in this article discusses the week's market action in depth, while also analyzing MELI stock as well Meritage Homes and PagerDuty, the two most recent IBD Stock Of The Day selections.

I wanted to reduce my risk and by Thursday, managed to sell one off at 324. Come Friday, the market had a proper crash and I sold the other two at 520. My broker is showing now showing a wash sale and is applying the stock purchased at 495 as being the one sold at 324. Yet if you apply the stock I purchased at 315 as I intended to happen, I avoid a wash sale altogether since I would have never sold for a loss at any time.

183,"Apple iPhone 14 event: A price hike is expected, but will there be ‘one more thing’?",4,x7d809,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x7d809/apple_iphone_14_event_a_price_hike_is_expected/,38,1662477500.0,"Apple Inc.’s coming iPhone 14 lineup might not bring too many new features, but there could be one big change in store. After holding steady on iPhone prices a year ago, some analysts expect that Apple AAPL, -0.10% will increase the price of its iPhone 14 Pro models this year amid camera, chip, and design enhancements—as well as lingering pressure from supply costs and the strong U.S. dollar. Amid the highest inflation rates in decades, there have been concerns about consumers growing more cost-conscious — especially lower-wage earners — but Apple is expected to keep its standard iPhone models at the same starting price while increasing the base $999 and $1,199 prices on its iPhone Pro and Pro Max.

“While the base iPhone will stay at the same price we believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. The company is expected to debut the new iPhone family at a Wednesday event that will kick off at 1 p.m. Eastern time. Apple’s smartphones are its biggest business by far, bringing in more than $162 billion through three quarters of the company’s fiscal year, more than 57% of Apple’s revenue total.

But The planned iPhone 14 debut comes amid uncertainty about how smartphone demand will hold up in the macroeconomic climate. IDC recently projected a 6.5% decline in global smartphone shipments this year, after shipments underperformed their estimates while declining for four quarters in a row. iPhone demand seems to have held up better than the overall market, however, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on the company’s last earnings call that he hadn’t noticed “obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact” on the iPhone.

185,Tool to Determine Total Return Outcome of Past Sells,5,xcetw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xcetw7/tool_to_determine_total_return_outcome_of_past/,12,1662994257.0,"Hello!

Has anyone seen a tool that will quickly calculate total return of your sells if held \[ideally with a brokerage connect option to avoid manual keying\]?  

Example:  
Sell 100 shares of AAPL on 1/20/96 == $2.30  
Total Return if held == $16,156.00 --doh--

I use Bloomberg and buyupside.com for total return calculations, but something a little more automated would be great to have.  Buy-side is always tracked with cost-basis data, sell-side is a little trickier."
186,401K Company Match Time,4,zx21s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zx21s8/401k_company_match_time/,4,1672207465.0,"Sup Friends.

With the year ending and dividends/capital gains/401K company match (100% up to 8% of my salary at $110K/year), I'm looking to change up future contributions and move some money around as well as see what everyone's 2023 outlook is and possibly a thumbs up/down on the plan below.

Current break down of my Fidelity 401K ratios is:

Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) -- 45.25% -- YTD:   -18.03%

Vanguard Growth Index (VIGIX) -- 33.90% -- YTD:   -32.97%

Fidelity Freedom 2050 K6 (FZTKX) -- 20.85% -- YTD:   -18.00%

FZTKX pays out dividends/capital gains on 12/30/22.  Thinking about closing out FZTKX and moving it all into VIGIX as we are basically at Oct/Nov lows and have a feeling the worst is behind us with a lot already priced into the market and TSLA basically in capitulation mode.  Also, of course, AAPL could always break the $130 resistance and drop a considerable amount, but somehow, AAPL always seems to surprise on earnings and this could be the turn around the market has been looking for; hence, I feel VIGIX will come back a considerable amount this year.

For the company match, which should be around $8-9K, I'm torn between a 50/50 split of FXAIX (can't go wrong with S&P 500) and VIGIX or 50/50 split with FXAIX and Vanguard Value Index VVIAX.  VVIAX is only down roughly 5.0% for the year and has shown serious strength (same as the DOW) but I've never really been a value stock investor and don't have too much knowledge on how they tend to perform in current economic conditions and long term outlook.  Would it be worth starting a potential steady and modest value index play or try to catch the rebound with growth?

Appreciate any and all feedback."
187,NASDAQ 100 vs. Individual Components of the NASDAQ 100 for the next decade,5,wvz8ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wvz8ni/nasdaq_100_vs_individual_components_of_the_nasdaq/,3,1661286700.0,"What are the main benefits of owning the individual components of the NASDAQ 100 vs. owning an ETF like QQQM? I am looking at the next decade and trying to decide if it would be better over this time period to buy AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, MRNA, COST and QCOM? 

My first thought is that the ETF would provide better diversification as it owns the 100 stocks based on their weights. As an aside, this would be a small portion of my overall portfolio. I am not talking about taking a larger chunk and throwing at either QQQM or the individual stocks I listed above. 

Is it an issue that the NASDAQ 100 rebalance once per year? I like the idea that as time does on, the weight of each stock will adjust and also companies will be added and removed."
188,Impact of inflation on retail demand?,4,w8dooc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w8dooc/impact_of_inflation_on_retail_demand/,2,1658821917.0,"One question:

Lets imagine all companies increased their prices regarding to their cost. As braindead as people are (me included) they buy their iphone 14 and macbook air m2 regardless. So e.g. Apples EPS are still a beat. However people do not have that much money left: people have no money to buy aapl stock which leads to less demand.

Should stocks not drop slightly (or big) no matter they beat earnings until wages rise and people can put their money in the stock market?
Or do casual people have no impact on pricing of stocks?

189,MVIS looks to present an attractive short opportunity,5,142u6ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/142u6ys/mvis_looks_to_present_an_attractive_short/,50,1686087697.0,"Looking at MVIS, there has been alot of internet hype about the stock. It's tough to nail down exactly why it is rallying, but I suspect its purely due to short squeeze mechanics. The shares available on iborrowdesk have shrunk to as little as 59 shares available and the fee has jumped to 59%. Considering how heavily shorted this is and how short sellers have learned how to better control these situations after GME and other meme stock run ups, the smart money is saying its going back to where it came from. 

I can remember playing BBBY back in August and similar mechanics were at play. MVIS has run up from about 1.82 low to now to a high of 7.27 or almost a 4 fold run up. BBBY ran from about 5 bucks to  30 for a 6 fold run up which really only stopped because Cohen sold his stake. So there may be more gas in the tank. 

MVIS also had a similar run from about $1.80 to $7 back in 2020 leading into 2021. From there it was able to achieve a price of 24 and several months later 28. However this go around, there is no stimulus money available to the public or easy loans for people to take out and yolo on the stock. Considering the liquidity necessary to carry the squeeze on is not there and retail primarily only buys options, I'd say MVIS is primed for a nice run back down to about 5.30 (where it came from today) into the end of this week. 

After this downturn which is likely to be a daily grind down, it may be a good time to look at going long again until you see  another blow off top on very big volume. 

Going long again due to another hype cycle via an event they are participating in June:   
MVIS ADAS & Autonomous Vehicle Technology Expo in Stuttgart on June 13-15.  Will showcase MAVIN and MOVIA lidar sensor product line. Visitors can also catch MOSAIK Suite.

I like the idea of everyone in over $4 being wipped out and that probably presents a good long price point.  It posted  30M today in volume which is almost up there in terms of 12 month volume highs. The company posted earnings on the 9th losing $19 million in the 1st quarter and made only 782k in revenue. 2022 saw only about 600k in revenue compared to just 2017 with 17.61 Million in revenue (pretty sharp decline). 

So MVIS is either going into the ground tomorrow and friday. Or it resists going lower and powers into June 13-15. The news whatever it is on June 13-15 will be no different of an effect than how AAPL just had a nice decline into their event. Plan accordingly"

*****
> Stock futures rose Friday as Wall Street looked to finish the week and the month higher.
*****
> S&P 500 futures climbed 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 66 points, or 0.2%.
*****
> Wall Street was set to post strong weekly gains. The Dow is now up nearly 2% for the week, while the S&P 500 the Nasdaq Composite are up 2.8%.
*****
> The major averages were also on pace for their best month of 2022. The Dow is on track for a more than 5% gain for July, while the S&P 500 could finish higher by 7.5%. The Nasdaq Composite, while still in bear market territory, is up more than 10% for the month.
*****
> That performance is a stark contrast from the previous six months when stocks tumbled to their June bear market. The market reversed as investors fears about the aggressive pacing of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases started to wane and the idea that inflation has peaked began to settle in.
*****
> Futures Thursday were supported by gains from two of the market’s biggest stocks. Amazon shares popped 12% after the e-commerce giant reported stronger-than-expected sales for the previous quarter, while Apple climbed 2.6% after posting better-than-expected iPhone revenue.
*****
> Chevron and Exxon Mobil also posted better-than-expected results for the previous quarter, sending their shares higher.
*****
> However, the latest batch of corporate results has been mixed.
*****
> Shares of Roku sank more than 20% after the company missed estimates and warned of a slowdown in advertising. Chipmaker Intel dropped 7% after its quarterly results fell short of expectations.
*****
> These moves come after a three-quarters of a percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a negative GDP reading on Thursday.
*****
> “The market is taking on a hope that slowing economic growth is going to result in a more dovish Fed moving forward, even if it’s a little further out. So it would make sense to me that weaker rates expectations moving forward would result in a little buoyancy in the equity markets,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist of New York Life Investments.
*****
> However, Goodwin cautioned that the unusual economic environment and the long period before the next Fed meeting make it difficult to predict the central bank’s path from here.
*****
> Investors will get updated looks at a key inflation reading and second-quarter employment costs on Friday, which could be key data points for the Fed as it considers its next move.

192,"AAPL reports Q4 earnings, Here's what the total year's revenues might look like and some other numbers to take a look at",5,yeuvo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yeuvo8/aapl_reports_q4_earnings_heres_what_the_total/,12,1666884447.0,"[AAPL 1](https://ibb.co/3hzb6L7)

1. Rightnow we have 3 quarters of aapl earnings  and this final quarter earnings gives us the entire 2022 year. The street is estimating something around 89b but what I am showing on the right side is a few different options.  So for example: If the quarter has a 5% growth in revenue, that would imply that our entire year revenue growth was about 7%. So that is how this reads.

[AAPL 2](https://ibb.co/9ZtcSy6)

2.   So this chart is showing aapl growth YOY. As you guys can see the trend is looking weaker andinto the single digit revenue growth

[AAPL 3](https://ibb.co/P992h87)

3.  These tables are showing AAPL Net income broken down into quarters and year. Take a look at2020 net income vs 2021 net income. Massive massive gains

[AAPL 4](https://ibb.co/dMhQfcP)

4. This next chart shows several data points on PE multiples with outliers removed As you can see,we are well above what the average is

People pay high PE multiples for companies that have high revenue growth. What's concerning tome is that we're seeing a clear slowdown in their revenue growth and many headwinds and yetprice is still very strong.

&#x200B;

I think there's nothing wrong with the company, but I think given the macro economic situation, I think investors might be paying too much right now.

&#x200B;

Would love to hear the communities thoughts on aapl in general."
193,FCF Yield of Stocks I am Watching,3,xrn18p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrn18p/fcf_yield_of_stocks_i_am_watching/,3,1664496457.0,"I recently compiled a list of stocks with their free cash flow (FCF) yield to see how good or bad that investment might be compared to a **2 year treasury bond (which is currently yielding \~4.2%)**. The yield was calculated using the enterprise value (EV) of the company since a lot of the companies carry a high debt load (think about AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast for example). 

**Here is the equation for FCF yield of a company/stock that I used: FCF(ttm)/EV and FCF(5 yrs avg)/EV.** So basically I looked at the trailing 12 months (ttm) free cash flows and last 5 years average free cash flows as well. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance app and approximate. If you like any of the stocks based on their FCF yield, definitely do additional research to verify /cross check the numbers (some of the data might be inaccurate because of human error ).

194,What should I focus on when evaluating a stock if I want to be somewhat conservative?,4,13y2nse,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13y2nse/what_should_i_focus_on_when_evaluating_a_stock_if/,17,1685679162.0,"I recently read an article in Forbes titled ""Investment Advice From The Vietnam Veteran Who Turned A 2-Bedroom House Into A $4.7 Billion Fortune"" about Arte Moreno and his response to one of their questions made me curious:

>**Forbes: What assets are you buying in this environment?**

>Moreno: There are some stocks in the market right now I like. They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it’s such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.

> I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn’t fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.

> I’m really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.

He considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.

For example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?

Thank you for any help you can provide. I'm genuinely interested in learning more about investing. I have a couple funds for retirement, but I was considering adding another account at Vanguard to invest in maybe 4-5 companies I like once I learn more."
195,Stocks optimism,5,y6uasb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y6uasb/stocks_optimism/,19,1666060290.0,"I'm just wondering, was reading an article on nasdaq and a few questions popped up. 

Feds are pretty clear that the rates will go up. In the article ""Data on manufacturing in the New York region was weaker than expected, adding fuel to expectations a pivot by the Fed may be on the horizon."" Doesn't change my view, but whoever wrote this article, do you truly believe that this will affect Feds decision?

Next, "" Major megacap growth stocks like Apple Inc AAPL.O, Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O all rallied, helping to lift the S&P 500 growth index .IGX by more than 3%. "". I'm very curious here. META lost 60% in a year, 8% in the last months. So,  up 1.xx% in one day, is this something we all have to jump on?

It might be rhetorical questions, I just don't understand this optimism, labor numbers came up, we went into red. Next day everything in green, and gets greener by the minute. Everyone expects the rate increase, which mostly will change the spectrum. So, how come everything and everyone is so positive at this very moment in time? None of the stocks on my watch list were in red today (from \~50).

Disclaimer, I'm new to stocks and investing, so please don't kick me too hard."
196,4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,4,14ezyqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ezyqm/4_tech_stocks_benefiting_from_the_ai_boom/,37,1687329944.0,"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.  
  
This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.  
  
**AI and the US Stock Market**  
In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.  
  
This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.  
  
**""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""**  
This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.  
  
Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. 

# Our Methodology

To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.

198,Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,5,11qdthr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11qdthr/keep_portfolio_sell_portfolio_and_put_all_into/,6,1678723799.0,"Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.

Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.

Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.

Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.

So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.

\- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)

\- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits

\- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits

If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).

I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!

TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual."

AMZN   -2.09%
BABA	   +8.35%
BIDU	   +7.47%
META	   +1.18%
GOOGL -1.83%
MSFT	  -5.41%
NFLX    +1.39%
NVDA  	0.04%
TSLA		3.42%

Average ~1.16% * 3

Which adds that it should be up more than 3% leading to about -5% difference of what it should be performing. Recently noticed that this is happening often. Anyone know what the reason is?"

&#x200B;

At the same time, the huge loss in market capitalization has also reduced their weight in the S&P 500 to about 19% from a record 24% touched in September 2020, and the influence of these global technology giants on U.S. stocks has been significantly weakened after a number of plunging markets in 2022. But it is undeniable that these tech giants have been major contributors to the long bull run in U.S. stocks over the years, driving the S&P 500 to record highs."

I'm not much of a seller, and I tend to pick relatively stable options that don't have a ton of mobility, as I use my account as a form of savings account.  I have a separate growth/ fun account where I take the riskier plays.  So far, this is what my portfolio looks like:

$3,700 total

LMT – 2.25 Shares – 30% of portfolio - $1084 MV - $474 PPS

AXON – 3 Shares – 19% of portfolio - $665 MV - $217 PPS

RTX – 4 Shares – 11.6% of portfolio - $409 MV - $98 PPS

AAPL – 2 Shares – 9.3% of portfolio - $328 MV - $156 PPS

BAESY – 5 Shares – 7.33% of portfolio - $258 MV - $49 PPS

NOC – 0.5 Shares – 7.22% of portfolio - $254 MV - $470 PPS

BWXT – 3.6 Shares – 6.5% of portfolio - $229 MV - $62 PPS

BAH – 2 Shares – 5.5% of portfolio - $194 MV - $99 PPS

RNMBY – 1 Share – 1.7% of portfolio - $60 MV - $58 PPS

BA – 0.20 Shares - 1.0 % of portfolio - $40 MV - $212 PPS

&#x200B;

As you can see, I'm fairly heavily invested in the defense/ aerospace sector as I feel that Uncle Sam is constantly pumping tax dollars into companies like Raytheon, NG, Lockheed, etc and they also supply foreign military with equipment sales.  They stay relatively stable for me, and dont tend to have massive swings, but I'd like to branch out a little bit into other sectors/ fields.

Do any of y'all have recommendations?  I put in between $600-800 every two weeks when I get my paycheck, and my next immediate move is to get all my partial shares up to whole numbers and then I'll start picking up others."

Fridays dip buy forwards the end of the day suggested this might be right on track.  The daily candles have a big hammer up on most of the SQQQ tech, and up on APPL and SPY.  This was supporting my logic more.  AAPL really seems to want to hold 150.  Las time it went bear through 150 it tested in once and then blasted through.  Anyhow, all this news about foreign markets/currency makes me question this logic as a strong catalyst usually outweighs any technicals. Tech might drop straight down without a bounce.  What do you all think?"

#[Stock futures rebound ahead of jobs report as Apple and PacWest gain: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Friday after tech giant Apple posted its latest quarterly figures, and investors looked ahead to the release of fresh U.S. jobs data.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 177 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.7% along with Nasdaq-100 futures.
*****
> Apple posted beats on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal second quarter, propelled by iPhone sales. Apple shares gained more than 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> Regional banks also rose broadly, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) advancing 2.4%. PacWest — which is down sharply this week on news it’s considering strategic options that include a sale — popped nearly 18.9%. Western Alliance also jumped more than 10%.
*****
> Shares of regional banking companies have been under pressure this week, as traders fear other institutions could suffer the same fate as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Both banks collapsed in March.
*****
> On the economic front, April’s nonfarm payroll data is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists predict that 180,000 jobs were added, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> The report will come after the Federal Reserve hiked rates by 25 basis points earlier this week. The central bank also hinted an end to its rate hiking campaign may be on the horizon, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it’s too soon to start cutting rates.
*****
> ″[With the] cost of capital going up in such a fast pace after we were at zero or 1% for so long, and then persisting at these higher levels, that’s just creating a whole suit of problems and we don’t exactly where the risk is gonna pop out,” JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The risk of ‘unknown unknowns’ is simply moving higher the longer we stay at the higher interest levels.”
*****
> Wall Street is headed for a week of losses — the worst performance for all three since March 10. The S&P 500 is off 2.6%, while the Nasdaq is off 2.1%. The Dow is down 2.8%.

So I’ve been trading for about three years now. I’ve done penny stocks and options where I’ve sat and stared at charts all day, tried to hold long term investments with the little money I had, and basically turned 400 into 600. 

This was mainly meant as practice for when I graduated university so I was familiar with investing without risking much and I’d like some opinions on my current idea for an investment strategy. I opened a brokerage account (not IRA) on Fidelity after switching from RH and plan on either doing: 100 in SPY, VOO, AAPL, and AMZN or just 200 in SPY and VOO. Then eventually try and hold in the money SPY calls 6 months to a year out once I build more capital.

(2) Buy inverse such as SQQQ ( hold only for short-mid term so my balance won’t be too bad during bear. If margin meets for my long term stock, I can sell SQQQ for profit and put it to meet margin requirements) or sell for profit when the bottom is seen)

In my taxable I have more ICLN, BABA, BB, AAPL, VXUS, IWM, SQ and a bunch of ARK funds.

Also, for those who buy individual stocks, how do you assess them?

215,Is there a good justification for AAPL doubling it's valuation since before the pandemic?,0,xq21lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xq21lh/is_there_a_good_justification_for_aapl_doubling/,11,1664337309.0,"I was taking a closer look at AAPL since the Bloomberg article and I noticed that their valuation pre-pandemic was ~$80 and they now sit at ~$150. I did a little surface level research but I can't find anything immediately obvious that would justify roughly doubling their valuation in this time period.

Some tech catered to the shifting economy (e.g. WFH), and it's understandable why they took off from 2020. But I'm not really clear how AAPL how this shifting economy would have benefited AAPL in any way.

Can anyone give me a briefly explanation about why this current valuation might be justified?"
216,Margin account and line of credit hybrid,1,x0a0w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x0a0w8/margin_account_and_line_of_credit_hybrid/,33,1661731242.0,"Are there any brokers/banks which offer such product?

For example, you buy $1000 of AAPL with your own cash.
Then you borrow $500 on margin and take $500 out of this account as cash. You pay low interest rate on $500(slightly higher than treasury rate)

Then AAPL drops by 60% and your account is now worth $400.

Interest on high beta stocks will be lower than interest on low beta stocks. Since all users are selecting stocks more or less randomly, in total they will approximate SPX.

Most brokers would have issued a margin call, but hybrid loan would provide $400(fully collateralized at low interest) + $100(unsecured at relatively high interest but still much lower than credit cards because broker will be able to buy SPX puts against multiple portfolios at the same time to limit their own risk). With interest calculated daily depending on price of the portfolio.

They can also give an option to combine HELOC into the same portfolio to automate pulling/pushing from it as price changes to decrease interest even more.

And your account will be able to go into negative up to approved limit of your ""personal line of credit"" before getting margin called, or whatever it is called. 

Once you get into negative territory, you have to start mandatory monthly payments to cover interest + some of the principal. Default may lead to margin call.


Does something like this exists in the wild?"

Investors have seen the best the stock market has to offer in 2023, according to Goldman Sachs. 

While the Fed is widely expected to pause its rate increases this year, the timing is wildly uncertain. That leaves investors staring down the barrel of potentially multiple more rate increases that could have the effect of slowing the economy and compressing stock valuation multiples.

Meanwhile, Corporate America is slogging through a disappointing earnings season that arguably doesn't justify the market's 2023 advance. 

Big household name companies such as Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Starbucks (SBUX) have not only whiffed on fourth quarter earnings estimates but also offered cautious forward-looking commentary. 

A soft landing — and in fact above-trend growth — is already priced in U.S. equities. Valuations are elevated vs. history and will be constrained by an eventual rise in interest rates. Even avoiding recession, earnings are unlikely to grow substantially in 2023,"" Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a new note on Monday. 

Kostin lifted his year end S&P 500 price target to 4,000 from 3,600, but he added the debt-ceiling debate is likely to be a key risk. The S&P 500 currently resides at 4,111 after a solid 7% year-to-date rally. "

I did time March 2020 correctly with buying up stocks right before the very bottom. For context I bought up VOO, QQQ, W, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA all on March 20, 2020. The bottom was on March 23, 2020. I did not care if I had caught the bottom. I just new when I pressed ""buy"" on my brokerage accounts that I had a discount on all of these ETFs and stocks. Did I get lucky to some degree? Sure. Maybe. 

I sold almost everything in August 2022 for a slight profit (note that I sold everything in April 2022 and bought back in early July 2022: VOO, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA). I am up this year, while everyone around me is down. So my plan for this next week is to buy back up in mass quantity until I only have 5% of my portfolio in cash. I will be buying up VOO, QQQ, SCHD, METV, TSLA, GOOG, SOFI. I will consider buying up the following if and only if they dip another 3% the next week: NVDA, V. 

So, here is the dip people. This next week will not trade sideways because we just don't do that in the USA after a massive sell off like we have had. We will either trade up or down but not sideways. So starting Monday make your moves. Buy up ETFs and stocks you want to hold for years. I messed around with SQQQ and broke even twice this year. My 2 cents on inverse/short ETFs is to not touch them. You are truly better off just DCA into QQQ, VOO and SCHD and buy more during dips."

Despite the strong bounce from its October lows at 134.37, AAPL still underperformed the broader market. With US index futures currently pointing lower, there could be more losses on the cards today. 

Friday’s bounce is an indication of significant amount of demand around these level, and longer-term investors may continue to find shares attractive at the current valuation. However, if today’s news is able to fuel a break lower, the stock could have a new low in its sighs given that the next major area of support appears to be at the YTD lows hit in June. 

All trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see if AAPL looks at risk of a new low this week, or if it can continue to hold support above the October low."

So the reason she apparently chose Nvidia is they are going to pass a multi billion dollar bill and she thinks the price is going to go up but NVidia is down 4% within the day alone unless it will go up within a week or two. 

This is where the confusion comes into play. Her choices for options, everything she put is going the opposite direction of what she has in play. If I'm looking at her two purchase options correctly she thinks apple and Microsoft are all going to be majorly lower than what the average price is by 2023? What information does she have that we don't. She thinks apple is going to be 80$ when its 150$ right now. She bet like 500k at least on those strike prices. Still new to trading but this is what I have for her trades. Would love to know what you all think.

The first being that when times are good, tech does better than the broader market. The opposite holds true; tech goes down faster and further than the broader market in bad times. The second absolute is that we are in bad times - Jerome Powell is trying to deliberately bring the market down. We can debate on if he should, but there is no debate on if he is trying to do this. 

The list of absolutes could continue - but due to us beginning the on average worst month for the stock market - I am betting against Apple and am buying up AAPD. I hold 21 shares of AAPD and will be selling when Apple goes to $141 later this month. We will retest the June lows, and there is a good chance AAPL with slide to $130 again, more money for those of us who invest in AAPD.

235,The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,0,zg7c4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,27,1670524762.0,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.

I also like to keep at least 30% cash right now, but maybe I should have more of that cash in low risk stocks like JNJ etc.

Anyways good luck all and remember that if you're under 40 you should just keep buying on autopilot into VTI or whatever. Don't woŕy about seeing RED in your portfolio.  You aren't concerned with what happens short term and RED means you now can buy either your index or favorite stocks for cheaper!!"

Here I am sitting with new MacBook pro with M1 Pro chip and Holy lord mighty, sweet baby jesus. Apple engineers have schooled all the braindead engineers from Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, fucking name it all, who have been in chip industry for not years but MULTIPLE DECADES. From the reviews I knew these chips are good but experience it first time in hand. I am ABSOLUTE mindblown.

I have been in software development for over 10 years now, worked with different software stack and hardware. But the amount of performance, and battery I am seeing with this is just unheard of without even plugged in. Somehow it is almost twice as fast as my last years i7 with almost 3 times the better battery life and fans don't even turn on. I just can not comprehand what kind of sorcery is this. Either they have beat the law of physics or other companies are legit braindead.

TLDR

Anyways I don't want to turn this into MacBook marketing post. But the point of my post is, AAPL is OLD, AAPL is still BOLD, and APPL is DAD of all. They are still innovating like crazy. This is growth company from all the angles. Don't sleep over it. With all the vertical integration, i absolutely can not wait for their AR/VR hardware and even car chips. Just imagine how much tech IP and leverage they have in chip designing now. I don't even think most people are valuing AAPL's silicon in their models.

AAPL $70

MSFT $110

GOOGL $45

UNH $250

What do you see as worst case?

Like I said with my 50% cash allocation I'm planning on a further 50% down but of course I'm not positive.

A lot are saying 3000, 2800 on cnbc but I think we'll end up closer to 2000 or even maybe 1700 or so after all is said and done.

Everyone should be at least 50% cash I'd say.

2) Big Tech undervalued - TSLA, AMZN, META

3) Major Players -   DIS, BAC. 

4) Risky plays -  SOFI, ARKK, COIN, PLTR.

5) ETFs - SPY, VOO, AVUV, ICLN. 

6) Currently Overvalued - NVDA, AMD, AVGO.

239,Review my AAPL stock prediction from 2022,0,14529oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14529oe/review_my_aapl_stock_prediction_from_2022/,11,1686308802.0,"Was I right in 2022? AAPL just touched a record $184.95. I argued that AAPL's changes that came during the pandemic would prevent it from collapsing back to pre-pandemic price points like most other stocks.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[**Original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sybtuk/6_reasons_why_aapl_isnt_a_pandemic_stock/)**:**

**tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.

It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.

AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?

Here are my 6 reasons:

**People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.

**5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic

**Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.

**Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic,** which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.

**Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.

**Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc..."
