1,Anyone buying AAPL calls before WWDC,26,13xw6l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13xw6l4/anyone_buying_aapl_calls_before_wwdc/,39,1685660458.0,"apple is about to announce product which may lead to a big stock increase 
Given the recent rumors of Apple's highly anticipated VR headset announcement on June 5th, there has been speculation regarding market interest in purchasing Apple call options. This is because Apple has historically experienced significant stock price increases upon the release of new products, especially those that break new ground in their respective markets.

For example, Apple's first iPhone release in 2007 revolutionized the smartphone industry and generated a lot of excitement and anticipation. In the months leading up to the announcement, there was a lot of buzz around the product, and this was reflected in the company's stock price. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock jumped 8%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 25% increase in the company's market cap.

Similarly, the release of the iPad in 2010 generated a lot of hype and speculation, and Apple's stock price saw a substantial increase in the months leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 1.2% and continued to rise in the following weeks, leading to a 12% increase in the company's market cap.

More recently, the announcement of the Apple Watch in 2014 generated a lot of buzz and excitement, and the company's stock price saw a significant increase in the weeks leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 2.7%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 9% increase in the company's market cap.

Given Apple's track record of producing innovative and groundbreaking products, it is plausible that the rumored VR headset announcement could have a similar effect on the company's stock price. The market may be anticipating a substantial increase in demand for the product, which could translate into higher revenue and earnings for Apple. Additionally, with Apple's reputation for consistently improving upon its products, there is optimism among investors that the VR headset will be well-received and help to solidify Apple's position as a leader in the technology industry.

As a result, there may be market interest in purchasing Apple call options in anticipation of a potential rise in the company's stock price following the announcement. Early indications suggest that Apple's VR headset may contain cutting-edge technology, such as eye-tracking sensors and advanced haptic feedback, which could make it a game-changer in the VR market. If the rumors are true and the product lives up to expectations, Apple's stock price may experience a significant boost in the coming weeks."
2,"Apple’s WWDC event is coming up. Puts or Calls, what’s the play?",19,13w4k9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13w4k9j/apples_wwdc_event_is_coming_up_puts_or_calls/,33,1685486586.0,"So, Apple’s WWDC will be debuting on June 5th and will continue till June 9th. 

They’ll be releasing all of their new software, iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10 and tvOS 17. But no one cares about that stuff, we’re all here to see if the new “Reality Pro” headset (which is the rumoured name) will be a turning point in how we view AR/VR. 

There have been reports suggesting that the upcoming headset could resemble ski goggles, featuring 8K displays, multiple cameras, and an external battery pack. It is rumoured to come with a price exceeding $3,000 (ouch). 

This launch is highly anticipated as Apple ventures beyond the iPhone and explores a new realm of wearable devices. It is expected to bring forth a fresh platform of apps and services specifically designed to provide users with an immersive experience. Should Apple release its headset, a significant aspect of the unveiling would likely revolve around the speculated xrOS (extended reality OS). Apple is anticipated to provide an overview of the primary functionalities, developer resources, and approaches for this operating system, which is believed to emphasize entertainment and communication.

In summary, the rumored Apple headset and potential xrOS introduction could signify a major milestone for the company, venturing beyond the iPhone into immersive experiences. While details remain unclear, the anticipation surrounding these developments is palpable, promising exciting possibilities for developers and users.

So is this a case of “buy the rumour, sell the news”, or will you regards put all your money into 0DTEs puts?"
3,Apple Headset Bill of Materials Leaked,7,13quptc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13quptc/apple_headset_bill_of_materials_leaked/,30,1684955574.0,"The bill of materials (basically a list of components needed to manufacture a product) leaked for Apple's new mixed reality headset that they should be announcing during WWDC in 8 days or so (whether it gets announced then is speculation still).

Most interesting numbers are the cost of production (\~1600 USD), projected cost (other sources are saying \~3000 USD), capacity (\~70k monthly), and quantity (half a mil by second quarter). For reference  i think the oculus is priced from around 400-1000 depending on spec, with similar profit margins.

&#x200B;

Not saying to load up on calls (especially since the announcement is still just rumored), but AAPL has been trading down recently due to declining iPhone sales and a rating downgrade. But if Tim Cook channels his inner Steve Jobs and kills the demo, the long term revenue stream might be quite good as developers flock in."
