What's your personal take on this? Is it just euphoria or is Apple poised to grow even further throughout the rest of the year?"
1,Apple's mixed reality headset announcement sends Unity stock soaring,38,142bzin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/142bzin/apples_mixed_reality_headset_announcement_sends/,11,1686048515.0,"Unity Software (U) stock soared on Monday, rising nearly 20% into the close after a shoutout during Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference.  
  
Unity's gaming software will be used in Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, Apple announced on Monday.

""We know there is a community of developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years,"" Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations said during the WWDC presentation. And today we are excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to vision OS features such as pass-through, high-resolution renderings, and native gestures.""  
  
**Volume in Unity stock shot up to more than triple the 20-day moving average as the stock had its best intraday performance since November 10.**

Unity operates a cross-platform game engine that was first discussed at an Apple WWDC in 2005 in regard to the Mac. The company went public in 2020 and the stock was bought up to nearly $200 a share during the 2021 tech surge in stocks. Ark Innovation Founder Cathie Wood is a shareholder. Unity is the 15th largest holding in Ark's flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and represents 3.46% of the total portfolio.  


On May 10, Unity reported first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates for revenue while posting a wider-than-expected loss per share. **Unity reported first-quarter revenue of $500.36 million compared to Wall Street estimates of $477.67**. Unity's adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.09 was more than $0.01 the Street had been expecting.  
  
Like others in the gaming sector, Unity spent its first-quarter earnings call positioning itself as an AI winner.  
  
""AI is going to have a profound effect on the industry,"" Unity CEO John S. Riccitiello said on the company's earnings call. ""First, it's going to lead to inflection up in growth as game types are built that were no longer â€” were not previously possible. And secondly, we're going to see, I believe, some of the crazy expense that goes on in some high-end production come down some. It's a favorable part of the game industry for growth. And I guess it'd be very favorable for Unity as we drive some of these changes through the industry."""
2,How would you target price META?,16,13ymfks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13ymfks/how_would_you_target_price_meta/,49,1685734290.0,"I got it at $92 (50 stocks) and I'm thinking how long the upwards tick can last. Some things I'm weighing in

Positives

1. TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly Europe
2. VR is growing and they are heavily vested in it, at the moment almost monopoly
3. It is still printing money despite massive VR investment
4. Instagram is very much alive 

Negatives

1. Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple reveals
2. Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and younger
3. As a VR enthusiast they are not exactly performing on their ecosystem especially Horizon Worlds development

My target is $350 but the soon upcoming Apple WWDC is making me uncomfortable."
