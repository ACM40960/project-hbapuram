>TL;DR: AAPL is trading down recently because of declining iPhone sales and a rating downgrade, but rumors are circulating that they will be announcing an AR headset at WWDC in 8 days. This may provide a good long term revenue stream for AAPL as developers flock to it.",t3_13quptc,1684955580.0,1

79,jlhmoql,t3_13quptc,"I work in electronics manufacturing, surface mount to be specific. Currently we have components (1206-09 caps) which previously were a fraction of a cent being purchased for $0.50 each! We have a huge amount of integrated circuits we are now purchasing for 500%+ of their price last year, and we literally can not source enough of many more specialized components even still with the current supply chain situation vastly improving. As an example there is a specific component I recall noticing this week. It’s only a simple fine pitch S08, we have purchased it 3 times. The first two times it cost us between $1-2 per unit, our most recent PO was $53 per unit. That is more than a 2,500% increase in cost. It is currently available with a 16 week lead time  on Digikey (retailer) for less than 2 dollars, however if we ended up needed some sooner than 4-8 months we would again pay out the ass for it.

There is one particular component we use, this is a prefabricated small PCBA. It’s actually a substitution for a different pcba which we have not been able to source. This particular alternate we have had immense difficulty sourcing, and often the supplier will have some in stock but deliver it to a different customer even though we had placed our order earlier.

In the current supply chain/manufacturing system there are immense difficulties sourcing more specialized components, however this is pay to play meaning something which may be essentially not available at a moderately inflated price is likely going to be able to be sourced for a huge price tag. If you do successfully place an order you may have an ETA of 1-24 months out which will often be repeatedly delayed, many times a PO will only be partially delivered piecemeal over the course of weeks or months

Apple is likely trying very hard to meet this project deadline, it doesn’t matter if the initial production runs are losing them money because they would lose much more by not bringing it to market in an acceptable time scale.

Once they build up their stock of the components used and have less of an urgent need to absolutely get their orders in on time they will likely be able to produce this product for exponentially less cost for the materials. And keep in mind for a surface mount line as Apple uses a huge amount of the expense is in the equipment not the material, and this equipment has a usable lifespan of ~5-10 years maximum.

Given the immensely inflated cost to get components in a timely manner you can likely expect this assembly to cost less than $200 in materials within the next 2 years once Apple’s stock is adequately built up and their suppliers have acclimated to the demand.

Tl;dr the total cost of the BOM is $2k or whatever now, but only because they need it all right now. On a more relaxed timeline it could be much much less.",t3_13quptc,1684967534.0,6

I don't think meta calls are the play, personally, at least with respect to the metaverse. meta just doesn't seem to have major software products in the near term to take advantage of AR adoption. they're notoriously behind on hardware (they literally only have oculus), and their (honestly very confused) vision of the metaverse seems clearly VR-centric, whereas apple is clearly looking towards AR and mixed-reality. Maybe LEAPS if you're feeling bullish, but nothing dated before 6 months.

If anything, meta has unironically been the best positioned to take advantage of AI, or at least, has the most talented AI engineers in FAANG (even compared to google). Their research teams consistently push out open source products people actually use, and generate the most newsworthy models outside of OpenAI. The main thing is that this, to my knowledge, does not really translate to revenue directly.",t3_13quptc,1684973316.0,1

I saw recently a new laptop launch without a screen, idea being that you would interface via AR glasses. it wasn't an apple product, but apple fans would be the first to adopt tech like that, especially since that could be one way to bypass the biggest problems facing the apple watch, say",t3_13quptc,1684972647.0,2

95,jlrlopz,t1_jlid076,"> If you have ever attended a horse race and you noticed in the camera shots that the horses seem to be chewing on something but there isn’t any grass or any other food nearby, from this action is that the expression “champing at the bit” comes from.

So this metaphor “champing at the bit” refers to a horse chewing out of excitement. Since “chomping at the bit” accurately describes the situation this metaphor is based off you can hardly call “chomping at the bit” a dead/dying metaphor. It still clearly communicates the original meaning.

Additionally “chomping at the bit” is MUCH more commonly used, and since this metaphor still retains all of its meaning when using the word “chomping” you can’t call it incorrect, but I guess you could say the original metaphor was “champing at the bit”.

In my opinion “chomping” provides a far more clear idea of the meaning of the metaphor than “champing” which is shorthand for champion (because the champions would be chomping I guess). Most people without having read about the phrase “champing at the bit” would struggle to discern that champing indicates doing what a champion would do, and champions chomp.

Therefore “champing at the bit” is a dying metaphor at best, but if it weren’t for the prevalence of “chomping at the bit” it would be an entirely dead metaphor. The average person would only know it meant excited, they wouldn’t be able to intuitively interpret it as the intended meaning.

So yeah, all this to say “champing at the bit” may have been the original metaphor, but at this point in time it’s less of an effective/alive metaphor than “chomping at the bit”. So IMO… you’re wrong. The metaphor is chomping at the bit in 2023 :)

So like…. since they mean the same thing the only way chomping could be the wrong version of that metaphor is if it somehow didn’t allow the visualization of the initial horse situation for the audience. But it does provide that, and it does it better than champing. So better metaphor, way more commonly used, and still very much communicates the entire metaphor instead of just being a stand-in for “excited”.
