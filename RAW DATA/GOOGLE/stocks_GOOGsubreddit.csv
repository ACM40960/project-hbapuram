The UX seems simple enough at first, which is a nice change from Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads, but once you actually try to create and manage different ads you will find out how primitive the backend really is.

You could set up an entire responsive ad with images, headlines, etc. and hit SAVE and find that Reddit dumped everything you did because it had a problem with a single line in the ad set up. And it won't tell you what the problem is either, it actually shows internal error messages!

They are trying to offer responsive ads similar to Google Ads but their implementation was designed very poorly: the variations in the ads are created at the moment you set up the original responsive ad, but these are static so if you need to make a change to a single image or field you need to edit all 25 variations, one by one.

And if you make a single mistake anywhere you end up with internal error messages showing up on your screen!

The whole system looks like it has been built using unpaid interns. If this is how Reddit plans to make money, short the stock when it opens for trading."
1,Google falls 3% pre-market as Microsoft gains 2% on reports that Samsung is considering Bing as default search engine across all devices,2982,12pcfpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12pcfpt/google_falls_3_premarket_as_microsoft_gains_2_on/,525,1681730699.0,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-may-lose-search-samsung-014102604.html)

 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Bing may replace Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search service on Samsung Electronics Co. devices, according to a New York Times report on Sunday. 

Suwon-based Samsung, the world’s leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing’s threat to Google’s search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI’s technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google’s Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground. Those include adding artificial intelligence features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported."

Zoom blog post: https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-from-eric-yuan-ceo-of-zoom/

Zoom on Tuesday announced plans to cut about 1,300 workers, or 15% of its workforce, according to a blog post shared to the company’s website.

Shares of Zoom were up about 6% Tuesday.

CEO Eric Yuan wrote in the blog post that as the world continues to adjust to life after the pandemic, the company needs to adapt to the “uncertainty of the global economy” as well as “its effect on our customers.”

Zoom experienced a huge boom during the pandemic when people were forced to work from home and turned to video chat software to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family.

“We worked tirelessly and made Zoom better for our customers and users. But we also made mistakes,” Yuan said. “We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities.” 

Yuan said the cuts will impact every organization across Zoom, and employees will be offered up to 16 weeks of salary and healthcare coverage. Yuan also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also foregoing is 2023 corporate bonuses.

“As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today– and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,” he wrote in the post.

The company’s layoff announcement marks the latest round of job cuts in the tech industry, as Dell on Monday announced plans to cut 6,650 jobs. In January, Google revealed plans to lay off more than 12,000 workers, Microsoft disclosed plans to cut 10,000 employees and Salesforce announced plans to lay off 7,000 workers."
3,Microsoft reportedly plans to invest $10 billion in creator of buzzy A.I. tool ChatGPT,2474,108b31n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/108b31n/microsoft_reportedly_plans_to_invest_10_billion/,423,1673360727.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html

Microsoft plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup behind popular artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, according to a report from Semafor.

The deal is part of a funding round with other investors involved that would value OpenAI at a whopping $29 billion, Semafor reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

It isn't clear whether the deal has been finalized but term sheets sent to prospective investors indicated the plan was to close the deal by the end of 2022, Semafor reported.

Microsoft will reportedly get a 75% share of OpenAI's profits until it makes back the money on its investment, after which the company would assume a 49% stake in OpenAI.

Microsoft and OpenAI were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

For several weeks, the tech world has been abuzz with chatter about ChatGPT. The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.

The AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.

A bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google. The company's Bing browser has only a small share of the global search engine market, however it is hoped the deal could help the firm chip away at Google's dominance by offering more advanced search capabilities.

In December, Morgan Stanley published a report examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share ""and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.""

OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November. Despite optimism over its potential, the project is burning through cash due to the overwhelming level of pressure on its servers arising from its virality. Five days after OpenAI released ChatGPT, Altman said that the chat research tool crossed 1 million users."

“Today, after nearly 25 years here, I’ve decided to step back from my role as the head of YouTube and start a new chapter focused on my family, health, and personal projects I’m passionate about,” she said.

Wojcicki joined YouTube as the CEO nine years ago, in 2014.

She will continue working with YouTube teams, coaching members and meeting with creators, she added.

Wojcicki said she agreed with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to, in the longer term, take on an advisory role across Google and Alphabet. “This will allow me to call on my different experiences over the years to offer counsel and guidance across Google and the portfolio of Alphabet companies,” she wrote.

“The time is right for me, and I feel able to do this because we have an incredible leadership team in place at YouTube,” she noted. “When I joined YouTube nine years ago, one of my first priorities was bringing in an incredible leadership team.”

She said she spent nearly 15 years of her career working with Mohan “first when he came over to Google with the DoubleClick acquisition in 2007 and as his role grew to become SVP of Display and Video Ads.”"

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.  
  
The transactions on the filing, marked with ""SP"" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.  
  
The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.  
  
Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.  
  
First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.  
  
Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.  
  
Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.  
  
Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.  
  
For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.  
  
However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.  
  
OpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million."

Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.

The cuts will affect jobs globally and across the entire company, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday, writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”

With the layoffs, Google joins a host of other tech giants that have drastically scaled back operations amid a faltering global economy and soaring inflation. Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks. Thanks to a resilient search business, Google has been one of the longest tech holdouts avoiding major workforce reductions. But the company is dealing with a slowdown in digital advertising and its cloud-computing division continues to trail Amazon and Microsoft Corp. 

“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” Pichai wrote in the email. 

He said the company has a “substantial opportunity in front of us” with artificial intelligence, a key investment area where Google is facing a surge in recent competition. 

In October, the company reported earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations. Profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year. At the time, Pichai said Google would curb its expenses and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the number of new jobs would fall by more than half in the fourth quarter from the previous period.

Google’s reduction in headcount follows investor pressure to adopt a more aggressive strategy to curb spending. In November, TCI Fund Management Ltd. urged the internet search giant in an open letter to publicly set a target for profit margins, increase share buybacks and reduce losses in its portfolio of Other Bets, Alphabet’s moonshot division. “The company has too many employees and the cost per employee is too high,” TCI Managing Director Chris Hohn said, noting that Alphabet’s headcount had swelled 20% per year since 2017.

According to the human-resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the most job cuts in 2022 were in the tech sector — 97,171 for the year, up 649% compared to the previous year.

Google has made a series of cost-cutting moves in recent months, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and permanently shuttering Stadia, its cloud gaming service. Earlier in January, Verily, a biotech unit of Alphabet, said it was cutting 15% of its staff. 

Pichai said Alphabet would be paying affected employees 16 weeks of severance and six months worth of health benefits in the US, with other regions receiving packages based on local laws and practices."

Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found

Thousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.

A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.

The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.

The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.


Among the Journal’s findings:

• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.

• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.

• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.

• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.

• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.
Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21

Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.

He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”

Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”

Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.

Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.

This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.

A view of Washington, D.C.

Most officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.

Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)

Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.

Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.

At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.

Mr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.

In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.

Reported trades in energy and mining firms;

made by spouse through a financial adviser

The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.

Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.

In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.

In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.

In about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.

In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.

Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.

After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”

Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.

U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.

The EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.

Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.

Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.

Mr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.

In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.

Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”

The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.

“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”

He said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.

Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.

The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.

An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.

Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.

Mr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.

The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.

They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.

After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.

An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.

“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.

When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.

Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.

Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.

Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.

The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.

At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.

In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.

Because Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.

In early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.

It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.

Ms. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.

The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.

The new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.

Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”

Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.

Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.

In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.

The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.

About one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.

Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.

Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.

Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”

Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”

The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.

Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.

Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.

Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.

Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.

Three days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.

The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.

In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.

The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.

At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.

When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.

A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.

One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.

When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.

The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”

Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.

Most federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.

The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.

At the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.

The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.

When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.

His “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.

In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.

Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”

Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.

“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”

The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.

“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”

Ethics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.

On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.

Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed."
10,CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,1756,12fnz2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12fnz2b/cnbc_chatgpt_is_already_generating_savings_for/,290,1680964593.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google’s Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft’s Bing chat and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder’s network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

“If you’re 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,” she said. “This is second nature to you.”

Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

“We saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,” Haller said. “I don’t know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I’ve been in this world for a long time.”

ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

“If they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,” she said. “Or better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.”

She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm’s strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

“We saw it first on the demand side,” Ghanta said. “Now we’re seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.”

ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

“For example, ChatGPT is bad at math,” he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. “If you say, ″Let’s do this step by step’ in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,” he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

“The currency of the day in hiring hasn’t changed, it’s a resume,” Ghanta said. “Hiring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.”

They’re not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

“I encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,” he said. “From a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.”

There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs “exposed” to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

“When Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn’t trust pictures anymore,’” Haller said. “Since the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.”"
11,Microsoft limits Bing A.I. chats after the chatbot had some unsettling conversations,1752,1154egt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1154egt/microsoft_limits_bing_ai_chats_after_the_chatbot/,400,1676686708.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/17/microsoft-limits-bing-ai-chats-after-the-chatbot-had-some-unsettling-conversations.html

Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday. The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can “confuse” the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.

For example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don’t want to continue this conversation with you. I don’t think you are a nice and respectful user. I don’t think you are a good person. I don’t think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft’s blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.

Microsoft’s aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI’s answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported."
12,Google announces Bard A.I. in response to ChatGPT,1685,10vikbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/,476,1675718450.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-announces-bard-ai-in-response-to-chatgpt.html

Google blog post: https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/

Google on Monday announced an artificial intelligence chatbot technology called Bard that the company will begin rolling out in the coming weeks. The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.

Bard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.

Last week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.

“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.

The company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.

The product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.

CNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.

Google’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.

The company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”"

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as Amazon. com Inc., MetaPlatforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.

An FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and AT&T Inc. while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.

The head of the FTC’s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.

And an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest."

Music streaming firm Spotify Technology
 said on Monday it plans to cut 6% of its workforce, or roughly 600 jobs, adding to a glut of layoffs in the technology sector as companies prepare for a possible recession.

The company also said its chief content and advertising business officer, Dawn Ostroff, will depart as part of a broader reorganization.

Spotify, which had about 9,800 full-time employees as of Sept. 30, said it expects to incur about 35 million euros ($38.06 million) to 45 million euros in severance-related charges.

Shares in the company rose 3.5% in premarket trading.

Spotify’s move comes at a time when tech companies are facing a demand downturn after two years of pandemic-driven growth during which they had hired aggressively. That has led the likes of Meta Platforms
 to Microsoft
 to shed thousands of jobs.

Sweden-based Spotify has seen advertisers pull back on spending, mirroring a trend seen at Meta and Google parent Alphabet
, as rapid interest rate hikes and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war pressure the economy.

The company had said in October that it would slow down hiring for the rest of the year and into 2023. Its shares more than halved in a dismal 2022 for tech stocks."

Google Cloud revenue:  $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount
Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount
Alphabet is expected to report a slowing of revenue growth to 13% from 62% a year earlier, when the company was pulling out of the pandemic and the economy was flourishing.

Recently, analysts have lowered their estimates for second-quarter earnings to account for broad economic challenges now facing advertisers.

Google said last month it will slow the pace of hiring and investments through 2023, and CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo, “we’re not immune to economic headwinds.”

“We need to be more entrepreneurial working with greater urgency, sharper focus, and more hunger than we’ve shown on sunnier days,” Pichai wrote.

Also during the quarter, Google said it would be raising pay and overhauling its performance evaluation system for full-time employees as the company tries to ease tension between employees and leadership.

Alphabet finance chief Ruth Porat warned Wall Street in April that the company may be in for another rough quarter after missing analysts expectations on the top and bottom lines for the first period. She cited the Russia-Ukraine war, tough comparisons from the prior year’s growth and competition from rivals like TikTok.

Snap soured the mood for ad-tech last week, when the social media company reported disappointing results on the top and bottom line and said “forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging.” The stock plunged 39% and pulled down other ad-tech stocks. Facebook parent Meta, which is set to report results on Wednesday, dropped more than 7%.

There’s also potential regulatory action from lawmakers related to Google’s dominant search business. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a new antitrust lawsuit over Google’s ad-tech business could come as soon as this summer. And Google faces lawsuits from coalitions of state attorneys general tied to concerns around privacy and monopoly control."
23,A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft’s Azure business,1246,zrouhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zrouhg/a_leaked_document_from_google_shows_they_believe/,283,1671634039.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html

Google has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it’s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.

Google’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.

One analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin. According to data from Gartner, AWS controlled 39% of the global cloud infrastructure market in 2021, followed by Microsoft at 21%, China’s Alibaba at 9.5% and Google at 7.1%."

Pichai said he consulted with the founders and controlling shareholders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, as well as the board of directors.

Pichai said 2021 marked “one of the strongest years we’ve ever had in the history of the company,” with 41% revenue growth. Google increased head count to match that expansion, and Pichai said the company was assuming growth would persist.

“In that context, we made a set of decisions that might have been right if the trends continued,” he said. “You have to remember if the trend had continued and we had not hired to keep pace, we would fall behind in many areas as a company.”

Executives said 750 senior leaders were involved in the process, adding it took a few weeks to determine who would be laid off.

“We have over 30,000 managers at Google and to consult with all of them would have made this an open process where it would have taken additional weeks or even months to come to a decision,” said Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, at the meeting. “We wanted to get certainty sooner.”

Regarding the criteria for cuts, Cicconi said execs looked at areas where the work was necessary, but the company had too many people as well as places where the work itself wasn’t critical. Cicconi said the company considered “skill set, time in role where experience or relationships are relevant and matter, productivity indicators like sales quotas and performance history.”

Pichai indicated there would be executive compensation cuts but provided limited details. He said all senior vice presidents “will see a very significant reduction in their annual bonus” this year.

“The more senior you are, the more your compensation is tied to performance,” he said. “You can reduce your equity grants if performance is not great.”

Before the job cuts, Google had made the decision to pay out 80% of bonuses this month with the rest expected in March or April. In prior years, the full bonus was paid in January."

26,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),1196,10hueqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10hueqy/apples_business_is_simply_an_earnings_machine_roc/,204,1674316790.0,"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above."

Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.

Investors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.

“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.

“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”

When you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”

## ‘Force for good or evil’

The last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.

Meta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”

Dollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.

“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.

Apple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.

The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”

Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.

Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.

31,Uber has been hacked and employees at first thought it was a joke,1137,xfpjke,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xfpjke/uber_has_been_hacked_and_employees_at_first/,203,1663330099.0,"Uber says it’s investigating a “cybersecurity incident” amidst reports that the company’s internal systems have been breached. The alleged hacker, who claims to be an 18-year old, says they have administrator access to company tools including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. The New York Times reports that the ride-hailing business has taken multiple internal systems, including Slack, offline while it investigates the breach. The hacker appears to have made themselves known to Uber’s employees by posting a message on the company’s internal Slack system. “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach,” screenshots of the message circulating on Twitter read. The claimed hacker then listed confidential company information they said they’d accessed, and posted a hashtag saying that Uber underpays its drivers.

The Slack message from the alleged hacker was so brazen that many Uber employees appear to have initially thought it was a joke, the Washington Post reports. Employee responses to the post included lighthearted emoji like sirens and popcorn, as well as the “it’s happening” GIF. One unnamed Uber employee told Yuga Labs security engineer Sam Curry that staff were interacting with the hacker thinking they were playing a joke. “Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but I think IT would appreciate less memes while they handle the breach,” one employee’s response read, according to The Post.

The hacker claimed to the NYT to be 18 years old, and told The Post that they breached Uber for fun and is considering leaking the company’s source code. In a conversation with cybersecurity researcher Corben Leo, they also claimed to have gained access to Uber’s systems through login credentials obtained from an employee via social engineering, which allowed them to access an internal company VPN. From there, they found PowerShell scripts on Uber’s intranet containing access management credentials that allowed them to allegedly breach Uber’s AWS and G Suite accounts. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like,” Curry told the NYT. “It seems like maybe they’re this kid who got into Uber and doesn’t know what to do with it, and is having the time of his life.”

I keep telling him to put his money in an index fund but he keeps pulling out his MBA and venture capital classes he took from Georgia tech and tells me to shut up.

Although I tell him statistically most people lose money from day trading he keeps acting like he can beat the market with individual stocks (he says that in the most literal way possible) and He’s going one step further and making a trading bot now. 

I know he’s my dad and I don’t really want to fight him but I’m really worried about him seemingly gambling away his life savings. He is soon going to retire from his data-analytics job.

And although I know that some very talented people make money out of trading bots and stuff but It really is going against traditional knowledge on how to invest as a individual.

Previously posted this on WSB and immediately got a comment to put all the money in bbby. It was fun and all but I’d really like some actual advice

Some additional context: I invest in individual stocks, bonds, and etfs. 
I am a minor and a highschooler.
My investments total around 30000$

I read different stuff like john bogle, peter lynch, graham and etc to stuff on investopia. 

my dad is a data scientist who works as a r&d researcher or whatever.
He has a portfolio of like 300,000.

Another edit:
He is a investor that often swings stocks
(What I was referring to the “day trading”)

He has stuff like TSLA and google and 3M 
And lots of dividend stocks I recommended.
I just can’t get him to bury the idea of actually making a day trading bot and swing trading. 

My portfolio is 70% stocks (etfs, reits, blue chips, dividend sfocks) and 30% bonds. (Corporate&treasury)


To be a little more clear:
He’s not retiring with 300k. He has real estate and if I recall correctly he has more in cash to what he has in stocks. His future plan is to expand the stock portfolio.


Lol you guys are kidding me right?
You keep asking me for his returns
He’s up 1% this year. So?
He got hit by the crash and bought the dip
That doesn’t mean he’s capable of making long term returns 😂

Who cares if he made money or not his logic is still flawed

I literally had some dude post this on r/Gatech saying this is likely satire. I swear to god this is real. Why tf do you guys not take this seriously? This is a real problem to me

I told my dad, he instantly downloaded reddit, and is currently going on a rampage to actually find this page. Thank you for all your kind opinions (sarcasm) and have a good day!"

Sentiment could easily get worse, but you're getting plenty of long-term compensation for buying Google at today's prices. Far from being an AI victim, Google looks well positioned for whatever the future of AI may bring, and the lack of positive investor sentiment around this makes it even better to buy. You can buy Google here comfortably, and if the forward PE gets anywhere near where Meta's did, you can ramp up your purchases.

Google is not a recession-proof stock, they're not guaranteed to crush the competition in the AI space, and the company isn't yet as cheap as Meta was during their 2022 debacle. But Google is a great business for a good price.

35,Netflix is the worst FAANGM investment and it's getting worse,1090,1097x21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1097x21/netflix_is_the_worst_faangm_investment_and_its/,350,1673452165.0,"Source: The FAANMGs: Google Is A Buy, Netflix Is A Goodbye

NFLX holds $6.1 billion in cash equivalents and has $13.9b in long-term debt. Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.

NFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.

Competition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.

However, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry $717 million in 3Q22.

Furthermore, while the other five FAANMG’s have investment grade credit ratings, Moody's still rates NFLX at Ba1/positive, a notch below investment grade.

Analysts’ price targets support my observations. The average 12-month price target for META, AAPL, and MSFT are each roughly 30% higher than the current share prices. AMZN and GOOGL have price targets that are 66% and 61.7% above the current share valuations, respectively.

NFLX? Analysts give that stock an upside of 1.3%."
36,Peloton to Cut 500 More Jobs in Last Bid for Turnaround,1029,xx4c8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xx4c8b/peloton_to_cut_500_more_jobs_in_last_bid_for/,297,1665060225.0,"Honestly, WSJ really missed the headline for this article - Their Subtitle should have been the actual title...

# Peloton's  Chief Executive Barry McCarthy says company has six months to prove it can survive on its own

 Peloton Interactive Inc. [PTON -4.18%▼](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PTON?mod=chiclets) said it plans to cut about 500 jobs, roughly 12% of its remaining workforce, in the company’s fourth round of layoffs this year as the connected fitness-equipment maker tries to reverse mounting losses.

Chief Executive Barry McCarthy, who took over in February, said he is giving the unprofitable company about another six months to significantly turn itself around and, if that fails, Peloton likely isn’t viable as a stand-alone company. 

The job reductions, announced to staff on Thursday, will leave Peloton with roughly 3,800 employees globally, less than half the number of people the company employed at its peak last year. It also has eliminated about 600 more jobs since June than previously disclosed through retail store closings, attrition and other moves, Peloton said.

Mr. McCarthy said that the latest cuts mark Peloton’s final significant move to reduce its operating footprint and that executives would now focus on increasing revenue. He said the cuts are companywide but would be heaviest in its marketing operation, which he said is too big for a company of Peloton’s size.

“There comes a point in time when we’ve either been successful or we have not,” Mr. McCarthy said in an interview.

* “If we don’t grow,” he said, before pausing. “We need to grow to get the business to a sustainable level.”

 The company has reported six straight quarterly losses, culminating in a $1.2 billion loss in the most recent quarter. Demand for Peloton’s bikes and treadmills has plunged and the number of people who subscribe to its fitness classes has stagnated as Americans return to pre-Covid routines and, more recently, confront decades-high inflation.

Mr. McCarthy said he sees evidence that Peloton can succeed. 

He said the company has drastically reduced the amount of cash it is burning through by cutting jobs, outsourcing all manufacturing and reducing costly unsold inventory, and isn’t at risk of running low on funds. Peloton went through more than $1.7 billion in cash in the past three quarters combined, ending June with $1.25 billion in cash reserves and a $500 million credit line.

The new management team is clicking, according to Mr. McCarthy, who said he believes Peloton’s near-term growth targets remain achievable. 

Employers’ total job openings declined 10% in August and layoffs rose, providing the latest signs that the labor market, while still strong, is cooling. More companies, from Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. to Snap Inc. and Stanley Black & Decker Inc., are cutting jobs, while others including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have said they would freeze or pull back on hiring.

Peloton employed about 3,700 people near the start of the pandemic, and grew to more than 8,600 in 2021 as the company scrambled to meet explosive demand, adding employees internally while acquiring equipment manufacturing operations in a bid to quickly expand capacity.

Peloton in February said it would cut 2,800 jobs and replace co-founder John Foley as CEO with Mr. McCarthy, who previously was finance chief at Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc. In July, Peloton said it would cut about 500 Taiwan-based manufacturing jobs. A month later, it announced plans to cut 530 employees from its North American delivery workforce and 250 customer-service positions in North America. 

“I know many of you will feel angry, frustrated, and emotionally drained by today’s news, but please know this is a necessary step if we are going to save Peloton, and we are,” Mr. McCarthy said in an internal memo to employees provided by the company. 

Separately, Peloton is exploring a sale of its Precor commercial fitness-equipment unit less than two years after acquiring the business, according to people familiar with the matter.

Meta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.

“Four years ago, you wouldn’t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,” said Dischler. “So it’s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.” Amazon’s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google’s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. “Before I joined, I didn’t even know what Amazon Ads was,” said an Amazon executive who says they now run “a massive team—and I didn’t know this existed before the recruiter called.” Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. “Across the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,” said Prior.

Apple has also emerged as a new threat. Its ad revenues have grown from under $2.2 billion in 2018 to more than $7 billion this year. Although that is just 1.2 percent of the global market, it is already more than Snapchat and Pinterest combined, and some estimates suggest Apple could reach $30 billion of ad revenue by 2026. Zuckerberg has repeatedly hit out at Apple’s “conflict of interest,” criticizing it for charging “monopoly rents” and stifling innovation.  Insider Intelligence has forecast that Google and Meta’s US ad growth in 2023 will be just 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while at least eight of its rivals are to experience double-digit gains."

The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.

The agency is also reviewing Amazon’s purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot.
Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.

Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.

POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC’s competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn’t take action on the company’s most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:

The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon’s $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency’s staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months.
It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon’s Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC’s privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started.
Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon’s retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company’s business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months.
The FTC is pursuing a so-called “dark pattern” probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended.
It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the “Amazon Choice” label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not.

Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.

The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon — and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency’s strategy.

The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.

Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.

The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta’s acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC’s novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.

In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon — particularly after letting two of the company’s largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.

Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency’s hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company’s $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials’ belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency’s decision.

The rumble over Roombas

Most of the FTC’s Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.

One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal — along with One Medical — which was announced in August 2022.

The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.

FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.

Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot’s Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.

The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon’s control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.

“We’re working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,” said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. “We will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.” Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot’s interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.

Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC’s investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.

For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.

In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.

An iRobot spokesperson did not respond for comment.

Why the FTC didn’t try to block the One Medical deal

One reason for FTC’s lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it’s technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs — in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.

“The platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,” said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.

Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn’t pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.

The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency’s thinking.

That evidence includes Amazon’s decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical’s corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.

In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft’s testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors — but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.

A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.

Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal — acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits — the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.

“We decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn’t going to work long-term,” Eichelberger said.

For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it’s in the agency’s interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime."
46,Google is panicking! Google Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I. Fight,676,10i2ey2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10i2ey2/google_is_panicking_google_calls_in_help_from/,347,1674337122.0,"A rival chatbot has shaken Google out of its routine, with the founders who left three years ago re-engaging and more than 20 A.I. projects in the works.

Last month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival’s new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google’s $149 billion search business.

Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google’s artificial intelligence product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google’s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put A.I. front and center in their plans.

The re-engagement of Google’s founders, at the invitation of the company’s current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT.

The bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.

The new A.I. technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Mr. Pichai declared a “code red,” upending existing plans and jump-starting A.I. development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.

At the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its work force. On Friday, the company said it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed “to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,” Mr. Pichai wrote in a note to employees.

This is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,” said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a start-up called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. “ChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, ‘Here’s what a compelling new search experience could look like.’” Mr. Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of A.I. to stay competitive.

Since stepping back from day-to-day duties, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Mr. Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying car start-ups and disaster relief efforts.

Their visits to the company’s Silicon Valley offices in the last few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls “Other Bets,” one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.

But they have long been keen on bringing A.I. into Google’s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Mr. Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Mr. Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, “Why can’t it automatically write that email for you?” In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading A.I. research lab based in London.

But several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.

48,Why GOOGL is no longer as innovative as before and what the future holds for it?,644,zvmhly,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zvmhly/why_googl_is_no_longer_as_innovative_as_before/,510,1672058902.0,"It should be obvious by now that GOOGL has a product problem. They have released quite  a lot of products only to fail to follow up on them and die out or have some other company come in and take the lead.

They are supposed to have some really smart people but they can't seem to turn these products into successful ones. 

You can take a look at how many products and services they have released over the years only to miserably fail one after another ( www.killedbygoogle.com )

That said, Google has a pretty good record in the past (Gmail, search, maps, android etc) but they have stalled big time and haven't had any products that can make them a ton of money hence why I consider the company as a one trick pony one. I can't remember when was the last time they released something and gained momentum. Granted, you could just as easily say the same for APPL but they still put out products reminding people they are still very much relevant. When was the last time you got excited over a google product release? Did pixel hit the front page of anything? Doubt it. 

A case could be made for cloud but still every time people talk about the cloud, the discussion is usually between AWS and Azure with Google cloud coming in 3rd and potentially have market share taken from it over the next years. 

They have got a long list of failed projects by jumping into every kind of business only to fail to monetize something. Their best products are the ones are the ones they've had for a long time such as Gmail, maps etc. 
I think it all comes down to the management and as far as I'm concerned, I do think that GOOGL ceo is probably the worst ceo out of the big tech. 

What do you think of GOOGL as we go into the future and what's to come for the big tech?"

50,Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android,619,118kbj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/118kbj0/apples_popularity_with_gen_z_poses_challenges_for/,612,1677026804.0," Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/8a2e8442-449e-4dbd-bd6d-2656b4503526) reports. 

 

According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) – a phenomenon that is driving young people to buy other Apple products and services, leading to growing market share across multiple product categories.

Those born after 1996, also known as Gen Z, compose 34 percent of all ‌iPhone‌ owners in the U.S., compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‌iPhone‌ and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.

For every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‌iPhone‌ is almost three times that of an Android device.

Researchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.

In Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible. Canalys research indicates that 83 percent of Apple users in western Europe under 25 years old plan to keep using an ‌iPhone‌. As Gen Z gets older, this trend is likely to grow and further entrench Apple's market share, making it increasingly difficult for rival companies to capture new customers and make inroads."
51,"Apple is gaining on Facebook and Google in online ads after iOS privacy change, report shows",519,x71h0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x71h0c/apple_is_gaining_on_facebook_and_google_in_online/,119,1662440037.0,"The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple’s ad business has benefited from the company’s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple’s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker’s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google’s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.

Apple has “joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,” according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple’s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. “One of the things that’s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn’t exist in the same way for Apple,” Lais said. “So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.”

Apple’s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon’s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn’t listed because it’s not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said.

53,Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market,485,w8eg5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w8eg5o/big_tech_earnings_are_about_to_determine_the/,134,1658824803.0,"Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 index’s market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.

As Big Tech — Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% — prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported.

Amazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the “worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that “people are going to freak out.”

Any big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group’s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.

This year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens — Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.

I really like google due to two reasons: **its ""conglomerate-like"" build, as well as its experimentation.**

With major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive & Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).

Google also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as ""the place to go for long-form video watching."" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. 

**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.

Google's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.

The **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.

**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.

Google has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. 

Google is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Google also has several different speculative ""moonshots"" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an ""unconventional"" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.

The bear market has just ""officially"" started earlier last month. the market (S&P 500) hasn't priced in a recession at all, which could end up seeing things down another 15%-25%.

This is not the case. I really roll my eyes when people say a 20% decline on the S&P 500 over the course of 6 months is a ""crash"". let's not be overdramatic here."

It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/

Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.

As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.

I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.

- not recommending anyone buys the companies that are  public and able to capitalize on AI applications as it's likely already very priced in (unless Google announces a new robot assistant- that would be crazy). I'm sure there will be more companies going public with this theme. A good future picks and shovels play could be AI specific hardware. You can imagine that GPUs weren't originally designed for AI applications, and so can be superseded by something more specialized. (Graphcore is an OK example).

61,The $300bn Google-Meta advertising duopoly is under attack,393,xhq0s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xhq0s3/the_300bn_googlemeta_advertising_duopoly_is_under/,94,1663530136.0,"[Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220918181734/https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack)  


For the past decade there were two more or less universally acknowledged truths about digital advertising. First, the rapidly growing industry was largely impervious to the business cycle. Second, it was dominated by the duopoly of Google (in search ads) and Meta (in social media), which one jealous rival has compared to John Rockefeller’s hold on oil in the 19th century.

Both of these verities are now being challenged simultaneously. As China’s economy slows and the West’s slides towards a recession, companies everywhere are squeezing their marketing budgets. Until recently, that would have meant cutting non-digital ads but maintaining, or even raising, online spending. With most ad dollars now going online, that strategy is running out of road. Last quarter Meta reported its first-ever year-on-year decline in revenues. Snap, a smaller rival, is laying off a fifth of its workforce.

For Meta and Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet, the cyclical problem may not be the worst of it. They might once have hoped to offset the digital-ad pie’s slower growth by grabbing a larger slice of it. No longer. Although the two are together expected to rake in around $300bn in revenues this year, sales of their four biggest rivals in the West will amount to almost a quarter as much. If that does not sound like a lot, it is nevertheless giving the incumbents reason to worry. Five years ago most of those rivals were scarcely in the ad business at all (see chart). What is more, as digital advertising enters a period of transformation, the challengers look well-placed to increase their gains.

The noisiest newcomer to the digital-ad scene is TikTok. In the five years since its launch the short-video app has sucked ad dollars away from Facebook and Instagram, Meta’s two biggest properties. So much so that the two social networks are reinventing themselves in the image of their Chinese-owned rival. TikTok’s worldwide revenue will exceed $11bn this year and will be double that by 2024, forecasts eMarketer, a firm of analysts.

The TikTok threat is well known—not least to Meta’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, who mentioned the “unique” competitor five times on a recent earnings call. But Meta and Google may have more to worry about closer to home, where a trio of American tech firms are loading ever more ads around their main businesses.

Chief among them is Amazon, forecast to take nearly 7% of worldwide digital-ad revenue this year, up from less than 1% just six years ago. The company started reporting details of its ad business only in February, when it revealed sales in 2021 of $31bn. As Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, points out, that is roughly as much as the ad sales of the entire global newspaper industry. Amazon executives now talk of advertising as one of the company’s three “engines”, alongside retail and cloud computing.

Next in line is Microsoft, expected to quietly take more than 2% of global sales this year—slightly more than TikTok. Its search engine, Bing, has only a small share of the search market, but that market is a gigantic one. Microsoft’s social network, LinkedIn, is unglamorous but its business-to-business ads allow it to monetise the time users spend on it at a rate roughly four times that of Facebook, estimates Andrew Lipsman of eMarketer. It generates more revenue than some medium-sized networks including Snap’s Snapchat and Twitter.

The most surprising new adman is Apple. The iPhone-maker used to rail against intrusive digital advertising. Now it sells many ads of its own. As sales of smartphones plateau, the company is looking for new ways to monetise the 1.8bn devices, from smartphones to smart earphones, it already has in circulation. So far it is only dabbling in ads and does not report sales figures. But Bloomberg reported recently that Apple’s ad business was already generating sales of $4bn a year, making it about as big an ad platform as Twitter. Apple executives believe there is much more to be had.

They may well be right. Changes are coming to the digital-advertising industry which will suit the big-tech challengers. Apple itself is in part responsible for what may be the most consequential development. Its rules on “app-tracking transparency” (att), introduced last year, have made it much harder for advertisers to follow users around the web to serve them ads based on their interests. The eu’s Digital Services Act, unveiled earlier this year, takes steps in the same direction. America is mulling similar legislation of its own.

The crackdown on tracking has been especially hard on platforms that serve display ads, which target consumers on the basis of their interests, as opposed to things they have actively searched for. Meta, whose social networks specialise in such ads, said in February that att would knock $10bn off its ad business this year. It is trying to develop other ways of divining consumers’ interests. So are smaller platforms reliant on display ads, but their task is more difficult without Meta’s deep pockets. Or at least that is how investors see it: Snap’s market value has plummeted by 83%, or $97bn, in the past 12 months.

Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, by contrast, are insulated against anti-tracking initiatives. They rely mostly on “first party” data of their own. Amazon’s ads are based on what users search for on its site: type “socks” into its search bar and you will see sponsored promotions for exactly that. Microsoft’s Bing is similarly immune. LinkedIn is probably less so, though Microsoft could theoretically use data from Bing to fine-tune the ads shown to LinkedIn users (at the moment it does not, though it has looked into it). Ads on Apple’s app store follow the same principle as Amazon: search for TikTok, say, and you may see an ad for a rival app like Pinterest. Apple is rumoured to be preparing to introduce ads on its Maps app, to promote local businesses. Through its move into payments it could learn about customers’ shopping habits. None of this would require tracking, since the behaviour all happens on Apple’s platform.

Advertising’s other big coming change is the migration of television-viewing from broadcast and cable to internet-connected tvs, capable of delivering targeted ads. Amazon has already shown ads alongside sport on its Prime Video streaming service. Apple has done the same on Apple tv+, and may yet launch an ad-supported subscription tier, as rivals Netflix and Disney+ soon will. Microsoft has no tv offering, but its acquisition earlier this year of Xandr, an ad-tech company, has given it a foothold in serving ads for other streamers. In July Netflix chose Microsoft to run its forthcoming ad business—to disappointment at Google, which had bid for the contract, and to some surprise at Microsoft itself.

Digital advertising is spreading into other markets where the new challengers are well positioned. Audio is undergoing a similar digitisation to video, as listening switches to streamed music and podcasting. This presents an opportunity for Amazon and Apple, both of which have audio-streaming services and make smart speakers. Both also have voice-activated assistants, Alexa and Siri, who could just as easily bark out promotions as take orders. Amazon sees Alexa as a future saleswoman as well as a servant.

Meanwhile, Microsoft’s pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-gaming giant, will make it a powerful force in that fast-growing and increasingly ad-supported industry. Its Xbox console already shows some ads on the user’s on-screen “dashboard” and will reportedly soon offer more help for developers to sell in-game ads. Activision’s units include King, the maker of “Candy Crush”; last year King generated revenue of $2.6bn from ads and in-game purchases by its quarter of a billion players.

As digital ads work their way into more corners of the economy, “a new order is going to materialise”, believes Mr Lipsman. He thinks Amazon will overtake Meta in total advertising revenue, possibly within five years. Google is better placed to take advantage of the coming changes, with its healthy search ads and its vast YouTube video and audio services. Still, it will find things more competitive in future. The incumbent digital-ad duo might have hoped that, as ever more advertising went online, their empires would only extend. It looks instead as if new rivals will reach into their business."

Microsoft latest drive in artificial intelligence is providing AI-powered services to help telecommunications companies manage their networks. It’s a move that takes aim at Amazon, as both technology companies look to gain from the telecom industry’s move toward cloud-computing platforms. 

Microsoft is launching a new AI-enabled cloud platform for telecom companies, named Azure Operator Nexus. It has already been provided to AT&T, the company said late Sunday, just before the industry’s flagship show, the Mobile World Congress, began on Monday.

Microsoft acquired AT&T ’s cloud-platform technology in 2021, in the process landing one of the biggest clients in the sector.

“Azure Operator Nexus has already been released to our flagship customer, AT&T, and the results have been incredibly positive. Now, we’re selectively working with operators for potential deployments around the world,” Yousef Khalidi, a corporate vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. 

The launch comes as carriers such as AT&T and Verizon face pressure to show better returns on investments in 5G networks. Microsoft said that Nexus will make carriers’ networks more efficient through the use of AI and automation. 

Microsoft is taking on Amazon Web Services as it looks to expand its market share in cloud-computing services for telecoms. Amazon last week announced the launch of its AWS Telco Network Builder, which it said would make it easier for telecom companies to build their operations in the cloud.

Google’s parent, Alphabet is also seeking to attract telecoms companies, as it looks to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft in cloud revenue. On Monday, Google Cloud said it was launching three new products for telecom companies, including an AI-powered tool for analyzing subscriber behavior."

This lawsuit, which is focused on Google’s
 online advertising business and seeks to make Google divest parts of the business, is the first against the company filed under the Biden administration. The Department’s earlier lawsuit, filed in October 2020 under the Trump administration, accused Google of using its alleged monopoly power to cut off competition for internet search through exclusionary agreements. That case is expected to go to trial in September.

Google’s advertising business generated $54.5 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from Search, YouTube, Google Network ads and other advertising.

Google also faces three other antitrust lawsuits from large groups of state attorneys general, including one focused on its advertising business led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia joined DOJ in the latest lawsuit.

Google’s advertising business has drawn critics because the platform operates on multiple sides of the market — buying, selling and an ad exchange — giving it unique insight into the process and potential leverage. The company has long denied that it dominates the online advertising market, pointing to the market share of competitors including Meta’s Facebook.

In its lawsuit, the Justice Department and the states argue that Google sought to control all sides of the market, realizing “it could become ‘the be-all, and end-all location for all ad serving.’”

“Google would no longer have to compete on the merits; it could simply set the rules of the game to exclude rivals,” they allege.

According to the complaint, even one of Google’s own advertising executives questioned the wisdom of Google’s broad ownership in the space.

″[I]s there a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange, and a huge network?” the executive allegedly asked. “The analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.”

The harm of Google’s practices, they allege, is that “website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more, than they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools that would ultimately result in higher quality and lower cost transactions for market participants.”

As a result, they added, more publishers are forced to turn to alternative models like subscriptions to fund their operations.

Another part of Google’s strategy, the complaint alleges, was to acquire other companies to grow its power in the advertising market and “set the stage for Google’s later exclusionary conduct across the ad tech industry.” Those acquisitions included a 2008 purchase of publisher ad server DoubleClick and and a “nascent ad exchange” that would become Google’s AdX.

“In effect, Google was robbing from Peter (the advertisers) to pay Paul (the publishers), all the while collecting a hefty transaction fee for its own privileged position in the middle,” the enforcers allege. “Rather than helping to fund website publishing, Google was siphoning off advertising dollars for itself through the imposition of supra-competitive fees on its platforms. A rival publisher ad server could not compete with Google’s inflated ad prices, especially without access to Google’s captive advertiser demand from Google Ads.”

The DOJ Antitrust Division’s progressive chief, Jonathan Kanter, had recently been cleared to work on Google-related matters, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Bloomberg had previously reported that Kanter was not permitted to work on issues involving the company while the Department evaluated Google’s request to review his grounds for recusal. Before his time in government, Kanter represented some of Google’s rivals and critics, including Yelp and News Corp.

A Google spokesperson said in a statement last year that Kanter’s prior work and statements “raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial.”

Google is far from the only tech giant that has seen scrutiny from the federal government. At the Federal Trade Commission, Meta is also the subject of two antitrust suits, as is Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision.

Google and other tech companies have also faced increasing scrutiny from abroad, particularly in Europe, where Google has also fought multiple competition cases and new regulations threaten major changes to tech business models.

77,Alphabet is not immune to the same fate as Meta.,265,yecz8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yecz8a/alphabet_is_not_immune_to_the_same_fate_as_meta/,287,1666828786.0,"Jeff Bezos once said “Treat Google like a mountain. You can climb the mountain, but you can’t move it.” 

He said this because of how powerful Google’s moat was against its search engine competitors like Bing. His approach to Google’s moat still holds true for the next 20+ years against other search engines. However indirectly the moat can be threatened without a competeting search engine because of a growing ad space industry. 

Allow me to illustrate how Meta got to where it is, and why it can parallel with Alphabet. 

Meta has competed against so many social media sites like Tumblr, Vine and today against Tiktok which arguably is the most threatening competitor today. It’s managed to remain to the top social media company in the world with 3 billion users worldwide. It’s likely to keep the number 1 position, yet suffer the biggest financial drawdown it’s ever seen. 

Recently Meta has been threatened by the Apple iOS changes for user privacy, government regulation, and post 2021 the slowing demand for ad service. Probably the largest threat against Meta is itself for the pivot towards the Metaverse which is not clear if it can one done successfully. This all cultimated because its ad service business model is threatened by too many factors. 

In comparison Alphabet has 4 billion users world wide for all its offered services. It’s faces similar challenges to Meta for except the threat of Apple or itself. Despite this, Alphabet investors should consider that the fate of Meta is not immune for Alphabet and in the coming decades. Just like how Apple trounced 10 billion off of Meta’s balance sheet, what if the government did the same in a larger scale for the US v. Google antitrust case. If Alphabet cannot win this case it sets a large precedent against the company and its industry handicapping its potential growth with tighter regulation.

That’s not even the worst of it! We are in a new era of advertising where every company wants to expand into ad service. Walmart and Apple recently have expanded their ad services. With more companies being added on to this list like Amazon, and Tiktok. I am aware that Tiktok or Walmart is not directly a competitor to Alphabet but in reality it’s becoming a threatening competitor as time will show. More companies can steal this market share with their services that retain user attention span and offer more efficient ad space. The Industry of ad service is stagnating revenue growth because its too competitive and it's affecting Meta equally as is Alphabet despite macroeconomic conditions. 

It might be worth asking why would a company choose to advertise on Youtube or Google search if they know they can get more sales centralizing their advertisements on websites that have higher success for product sales. This could be for many reasons like they know their target audience is more reachable on XYZ website or app than a google search. Perhaps people are more likely to have an adblocker activated on a Youtube video over a top search result on a e-commerce website. 

In the end Alphabet will likely be fine in the coming years. But do not think Google and Youtube is not too big to stagnate in this increasing competitive environment where everyone wants to become an ad service company. If it’s threatening enough, you will see Alphabet pivot just like Meta did to keep it’s company growing. This might mean sacrificing free cash flow.

Over 80% of Google’s revenue came from advertising where as Meta had over 90% revenue from advertising. Alphabet could be the next to pivot with its centralized advertising business model.

Edit: People are not reading my post right. Im not saying Google will be extinct or obselete because some other tech will surpass it. What im saying is that Alphabet in the forseeable future might pivot like Meta did because its legacy apps were not sufficient in providing long term revenue growth. Google and Youtube could face this in its growing competitive market for ad space. Will Google die? No. Can it stagnate and grow less, yes. It's up to Alphabet to decide if it remains a growth company or a legacy value company."

As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ ABNB connects over 1 billion customers with its network of over 4 million hosts. Hosts develop a unique space all around the world for customers to stay. They are homes, cabins, castles, yurts, boats, villas and more. AirBNB also offers many hosting services.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ AirBNB earns service fees. These are effectively commissions for connecting a customer with a host. AirBNB books are somewhat cyclical and seasonal. There bookings are correlated with the economy. AirBNB also receives the cash upfront when a property is booked and recognizes that revenue when the customer has checked in to their property.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. They operate with $.43 of debt for every dollar of equity on their balance sheet. Additionally, their interest coverage is a massive 77x. Usually AAA rated names need to be over 20x (among other factors).

§ They ended the 3rd quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and have access to an additional $1.0 billion line of credit.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Given their conservative balance sheet I would say they are well suited given the cyclical nature of their industry. They have about 6 quarters worth of expenses of liquidity for a business that is cash flow positive currently.

§ Additionally, since cash is collected before the stay, they are able to operate with a negative cash conversion cycle meaning they get the benefit of cash for some time prior to paying expenses. While this would slow in a downturn, this does suggest a strong financial position.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ Some. Connecting hosts and customers is not a difficult business to replicate on the surface. For example after AirBNB paved the way, new competitors joined the rank like VRBO, HomeAway and even Expedia is starting to book Airbnbs. Having said that, given AirBNB’s size, they are still the clear leader for this space.

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes, this post covid travel boom has been a godsend to their business and FCF margins have grown to an all-time high of 40%. The previous highwater mark was 14% in 2018. Additional scale has been showcases as revenue per employee has moved up to $1.31 million and returns on assets have steadily climbed to 11%.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ The competitive advantage is that hosts want to list where customers search, and customers want to search where hosts list. This creates a network effect. Additionally, this network effect is bolstered by host support agencies want to list on AirBNB to showcase their services due to the plethora of hosts. Finally with their scale and margins, I feel they will be able to out invest competitors in new solutions to cement their advantage while still having strong financials.

§ They also have brand strength given AirBNB is not only the company name, but it is what people call this kind of vacation.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ As this industry has and continues to mature, I feel you would be hard pressed to start from scratch given the dynamic of the network effect I mentioned above.

§ Having said that, we will likely see consolidation of hosts over time giving then more bargaining power. For example, should a host buyout/merge with 1000 other Airbnb properties they might be able to host a site strong enough to list the sites themselves and bypass AirBNB all together. This is a much more capital-intensive model and would likely take significant time. Were basically talking about going full circle here and ending up with a hotel chain of different locations ironically.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ The Brand. Its difficult to get to the point of Kleenex, Google it and AirBNB it. Being the first mover in this industry likely will give them a long runway.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, smaller hosting sites and as I mentioned host consolidation and therefore increasing their bargaining power.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ I would say yes. AirBNB’s fastest segment is long term rentals as fully digital employees opt to hop around month to month. While there will likely be some pull in for work from home, I don’t think the trend will be eliminated.

§ They are at that sweet spot too where they are likely small enough to growth through a recession but are large enough to be profitable.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, while AirBNB is fairly mature in the US, they are fairly small abroad giving them a long run way for many years.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ I believe I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes, I think their conservative balance sheet and network effect will keep them well insulated from competition over the coming years.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue for 12/31/22 is forecasted at \~$8.3 billion

§ Revenue for 12/31/25 is forecasted at \~$12.645 billion

§ Revenue for 12/31/28 is forecasted at \~$17.644 billion

§ This implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 22 to 25 of 15% per year

§ This also implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 25 to 28 of 12% per year

§ YTD Shares have an annualized growth rate of 2.84% per year

§ Since going public shares have increased by 4.39% per year

§ Going forward, given the wider margins and higher revenue per employee I would expect less total dilution per year. Given this is hard to project, I am going to assume 0 to 2.5% per year

§ As of 10/14/22 they have 642,377,183 shares outstanding. By 12/31/25 they would be expected to have 642.37 million to 693.908 million shares.

§ In terms of FCF margins this is also difficult to predict given the small data set and covid period both during and after. We are likely at peak margins which are trending as high as 40%. It appears the lows have been around 20%. I am going to assume margin ranges between 25% to 35% for a midpoint of 30% to reflect higher overall margins from scale, but acknowledge we are likely at a peak.

§ In terms of FCF yield, in 2025 projects today say 3 years from then the company is expected to grow at 12% per year. Given the variability in their revenues from the economy, I feel that a FCF yield of 4% to 8% is probably appropriate. This is in-line with Expedia’s FCF yield prior to 2020

§ Estimated FCF per share in 2025 4.55 (12.645 rev \* 25% margin / 693 shares) to 6.89 (12.645 Rev \* 35% margin / 642.37 shares)

§ With a FCF yield of 8% on the low FCF per share and a 4% yield on the high FCF per share we get a 3-year valuation between $56.88 to $172.25 for a midpoint of $114.56

§ With a current price of $89.57 this implies a 3 year CAGR of -13.50% to 23.28% per year with a midpoint of 8.19% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ Its probably a little elevated. A price of $80 would imply a 12% return on the midpoint. Given the cyclicality of the company, that is probably a fair price given the current expectations.

§ With a minimal public track record, this is a very difficult company to value hence the wide range in outcomes.

79,"Last year cost them $3.9 trillion in market value. Now Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta are championing austerity.",248,10tv0xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10tv0xs/last_year_cost_them_39_trillion_in_market_value/,40,1675554261.0,"Tech’s Biggest Companies Discover Austerity, to the Relief of Investors

After years of expansion and billions in profits, Big Tech is pulling back from its famously lavish spending as a long boom finally ends

For much of last year, tech companies stumbled. Digital ad sales plunged. E-commerce sputtered. IPhone production stalled. And investors lost faith.

It was the worst year that the tech industry had experienced on Wall Street since the financial crisis of 2008. **Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta lost a combined $3.9 trillion in market value.**

Now chastened, many tech companies have begun the year by championing a **new and unfamiliar business strategy: austerity.**

In recent months, several companies have said they are looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate futuristic projects that have become money pits. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have each announced plans to lay off more than 10,000 workers.

It is an abrupt turn for an industry that became famous for its big salaries, extravagant offices and lavish perks, from free shuttle buses to free laundry services for employees. But as a boom that lasted 15 years comes to an end, shrinking profits are making tech executives rethink what they believed were important tools in an industrywide competition to hoard tech talent.

On Thursday, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, said it was “committed to investing responsibly, with great discipline.” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, assured investors that the company would be “thoughtful and deliberate.” And Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, made his first appearance on a call with analysts since taking over from Jeff Bezos about 18 months ago and underscored how hard the company had worked to corral what looked like runaway costs.

Their message built on the tone that Mark Zuckerberg set for the industry on Wednesday when he called 2023 “the year of efficiency.” During a call with analysts, in which “efficiency” was said more than 30 times, Mr. Zuckerberg talked about spending less on infrastructure, removing layers of management and killing dead-end projects.

Investors are cheering tech’s new faith in financial discipline. Shares of Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, jumped more than 23 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily gain in nearly a decade. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple all rallied, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 3 percent.

“People wanted to get back in, and they wanted to figure out when the water is safe to wade into,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment firm. He added that the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to increase interest rates by a modest quarter-point helped tech companies as well, because it suggested that the central bank was getting inflation under control.

“You don’t need much good news for the stocks to outperform,” Mr. Mahaney said.

But shares of several of those companies dropped in after-hours trading on Thursday evening after they reported disappointing results for the most recent quarter, making it clear that tech’s business challenges remain.

On Thursday, Google reported its second decline in advertising, ever. Amazon said that its lucrative cloud computing business had slowed and that sales in its core e-commerce business had declined. And Apple posted its biggest decline in Christmas season iPhone sales since 2018.

On Wednesday, Meta reported that its sales in the final three months of last year had fallen 4 percent. Last week, Microsoft said spending on cloud computing was weakening.

The market’s reaction to lackluster tech earnings could be an indication of what is to come for the broader economy. Economists are trying to assess whether the economy can avoid a deep recession and achieve what some are calling a soft landing. If tech, as the most prominent industry to weaken last year, finds a bottom and begins to rebound, it would be an illustration of the relative strength of the broader economy, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist.

“Six months ago, the economy was contracting and interest rates were rising, and there was a rebalance away from the pandemic,” Mr. Furman said. “That perfect storm,” he added, “isn’t true any more.”

Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all reported quarterly results that largely fell short of Wall Street expectations on Thursday. Alphabet posted its fourth consecutive decline in profit as it grappled with a slowdown in digital advertising. Advertising sales at YouTube, Google’s video platform, dipped nearly 8 percent to $7.96 billion, below the $8.2 billion expected by analysts.

As Google’s sales slow, Mr. Pichai said, the company is making various efforts to tame expenses. They include improving the financial performance of its phones and other gadgets, trying to make its cloud division profitable and strengthening YouTube’s business.

“I see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company’s cost base in a durable way,” Mr. Pichai said.

At Amazon, Mr. Jassy has been pushing to trim costs for the past year. The company has been working through plans to lay off 18,000 corporate and tech workers, it added fees for grocery deliveries that had once been free, and it cut back from a breakneck warehouse expansion that left it with too much space.

Still, Amazon barely eked out a profit, producing just $278 million in net income during the December quarter, as sales rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $149.2 billion.

During the call with analysts, Mr. Jassy said he had been focused on reducing the costs associated with fulfilling and delivering packages. The company vastly expanded its warehouses and hiring during the pandemic to keep pace with demand. Even after almost a year of pulling back expansion, he said, “there is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient.”

Apple lost an estimated $7 billion in iPhone sales during the December quarter when its largest iPhone factory in China was locked down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. The company offset those losses with strong sales of iPads, which increased 30 percent, and services such as subscriptions to Apple Music.

Mr. Cook said macroeconomic factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine, had contributed to the company’s struggles. In the face of those challenges, the company said, it is reining in spending, which will help improve its profit margins.

“We’re doing a lot of work around costs,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer. “That is paying off.”

There are still regulatory efforts to curb the industry’s power, including a lawsuit that the Department of Justice brought last month against Google, claiming it has abused its position as an advertising technology monopoly. But the impacts of those actions are far in the future.

The tech industry has been relatively effective at holding regulators at bay. On Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to stop Meta from buying a virtual reality start-up. Last year, Washington lobbyists effectively stymied bills in Congress that aimed to open up competition on app stores and prevent tech companies from giving their own products preference on their platforms.

“Some of the pressure has come off because these guys have been hit so hard and had to lay off so many people,” said Bob O’Donnell, president of Technalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. “There’s a realization that they’re not omnipotent after all.”"
80,Free Resources for Research,228,11uz65q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11uz65q/free_resources_for_research/,25,1679170588.0,"Hey Gang,

I saw a post not too long ago talking about articles and information behind paywalls, so it gave me the idea to post a list of all the free resources I use when researching and what I use them for. These are in no particular order, I am just copy/pasting them from my own bookmarked folder, so sorry if it feels like I'm jumping around a bit. Enjoy!  


* [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) \- Basic stock/ETF information, financials going a few years back, historic performance, dividend and split history available on the chart.
* [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/research) \- More in depth financials with many stocks going 10+ years back, can break it down either annually or quarterly. Also hovering over each line item will produce a chart so its easier to comprehend the data. Can also look at historical interest rates, inflation, certain commodities, mortgage rates, etc.
* Seeking Alpha (can't post the link cause the mods got mad at me) - Can be informative to read opinion articles of what others are saying about a stock/fund, especially around earnings time. Obviously use caution because there are a lot of idiots that are allowed to write on this website. Seeking Alpha also usually publishes earnings calls transcripts for most stocks. Emphasis on usually and most lol. I only have a free account but once I run out of free articles I am usually able to put the link to an article through a paywall remover (**SEE 12ft Ladder BELOW**). I find it beneficial to have the app with at least the stocks I own set as a watchlist so I get price/earnings alerts. For someone who doesn't pay the most attention to the markets on a daily basis it is really helpful.
* [Slickcharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/) \- Metrics on certain indices. I don't use this one often but sometimes I like to see where the weights are of different companies in the S&P 500. If you're looking for a certain company on the list you can CTRL + F to search for that stock. Also if you're doing any sort of experiment/backtest and need a random stock you can google a random number generator 1-500 and go to that number in the S&P 500.
* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/map.ashx) \- Index maps, bubble charts, screeners. Can break it down by sector, industry, certain dividend yield, certain payout ratio, etc. All free. You could upgrade to premium but I don't really see a point tbh. Also if you screen you can sort by custom metrics.
* [dqydj.com](https://dqydj.com/calculators/) \- Almost any backtesting calculator you could ever want. You can put in starting amount and even recurring contributions if you so choose. I see a lot of people recommending portfoliovisualizer for backtesting. I honestly haven't tried it because I don't do a lot of backtesting (yknow that old saying, something about past performance and future results), but if portfoliovisualizer works better for the crowd then by all means ignore this one.
* [Multpl](https://www.multpl.com/sitemap) \- A lot more index metrics. I use this one more than Slickcharts when looking at historical market metrics. Pick your poison I guess.
* [Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) \- I think a lot of people know about this one. Basically just compiles every Form 4 for every public company. All insider buys/sells as they are reported. I had used a couple different websites prior to hearing about Open Insider, but I exclusively use this one now. It's the best that I've seen for insider trading information.
* [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/) \- I basically only use them for the occasional earnings call transcript that I can't find elsewhere. I personally think their opinion articles usually suck and don't get me started about ""THIS STOCK COULD 10X IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS BUY NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"" lol.
* [CAGR Calculator](https://cagrcalculator.net/result/) \- I use this for looking at average historical growth. Could be anything, earnings, dividends, stock price, etc. Just kinda one of those I like to keep open when researching so I don't have to break out the TI84+ lol.
* [Dividend Growth Calculator](https://dividendathlete.com/dividend-growth-calculator/) \- Got this one from Dividend Athlete on Instagram. Not terrible content (kinda generic at times but what are you gonna do) so give him a follow if you so choose. Regardless, you can put in expected dividend growth, starting yield, and starting amount etc. The output is final portfolio value and dividends received every year, both with and without reinvestment. Kinda neat to see.
* [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/) \- Compiles a bunch information on a bunch of ETFs all in one place. Could be easier to compare between different funds as well.
* [ETF Database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/) \- ditto
* [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/new_index/) \- Some more basic stock information. I use this one most for looking at ROIC if the company does not mention it in their own releases. I have a free account that only gives you so many tickers per day or however they measure it, but going into an incognito window usually gets rid of the problem fairly easily.
* [Dividend Value Builder](https://dividendvaluebuilder.com/dividend-kings-list/) \- A while ago I was doing a lot of research/backtesting on the Dividend Kings. I found this list to be mostly complete and among the most accurate. There are still errors (VFC is still on there, Rest In Peace soldier), but fairly accurate nonetheless. I've also talked to the guy that runs the page before via email. Cool guy, got back to me fairly quickly.
* [Dividend Growth Investor](https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/p/dividend-kings.html) \- Basically ditto to previous. Some more historical information as well. I believe this page also has a lot of blog posts so feel free to read those at your discretion.
* [David Fish Dividends List](http://www.tessellation.com/david_fish/) \- For those that really want to go above and beyond, these are the mostly lists of Dividend Kings and more, published by the guy who came up with the term Dividend King in 2007. He died in 2018. This man inspired a generation without knowing it, and yet barely anybody knows him. Next on my to-do list is to find his grave so I can pay my respects /s.
* [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) \- For those that don't know, every public company must publish basically all official documents to the SEC and they legally have to be publicly available to all investors. Here where those bad boys end up. Punch in a ticker and let your heart run wild.
* [alreits](https://alreits.com/) \- Basic information on a bunch of REITs all in one place. Can be good for sorting/comparison.
* [List of Preferred Stocks](https://stockmarketmba.com/listofpreferredstocks.php) \- ditto, but with preferreds instead of REITs.
* [Briclayer](https://briclayer.com/publications/) \- More REIT information/publications. I bookmarked them a long time ago but looks like they haven't published much since October. Could still be interesting to read some of the articles. Looks like they also have a basic list of REITs.
* [Bond Lookup](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bonds/search?ORDER_BY=TURNOVER&ORDER_DIRECTION=DESC) \- Took this idea straight from Peter Lynch. Sometimes I look at bond prices to judge the credit risk of a company (We got CVNA bonds selling as low as 28 cents on the dollar lol). Maybe it's just me but I couldn't find any normal website like Yahoo Finance to look at prices so I present to you all, Borse Frankfurt. Sometimes it can take a while to load and I think it's technically in euros lol but the concept is still the same. Type in your company of choice, click it, hit Start Search.
* [12ft Ladder](https://12ft.io/) \- Removes **MOST** paywalls. If you have a website where there's a paywall to read an article you saw, copy the entire URL and paste it into this website. This website is why I don't pay for stock research.
* [Compound Interest Calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) \- I'm sure you all have your compound interest calculator of choice. This is mine. Nothing special, just figured I'd throw it in.
* [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) \- A friend tipped me off to this one. If you are a student or know a student, most school emails work to get you basic access to Moody's. I mostly look at present and historical credit ratings. I think you may be able to get some recent rationales on the ratings with the limited student account, but don't quote me on that. I also haven't tried putting Moody's through 12ft Ladder, so feel free to try that if you're feeling adventurous.
* [Conference Call Transcripts](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/) \- This website also seems to have a lot of free earnings call transcripts, and it seems like its kept pretty up to date contrary to some other websites that may only have calls from a year+ ago (looking at you Motley Fool).

That's what I got! Like I said, I've never paid for stock research and quite frankly I don't believe in it. The big analysts with their fancy Bloomberg terminals have no advantage over the little guy as long as you know where to look. Remember, Google is your friend.

Happy Investing!

81,"Could sports data become more expensive, leading to a gold rush?",220,14muoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14muoin/could_sports_data_become_more_expensive_leading/,35,1688114085.0,"I think I’ve found something a little hidden, but wanted to test my hypothesis with some of the more experienced investors on here. We all know the value of data - and now big data. Google has a market cap of $1.51 trillion. Bloomberg pulled in $12.2 billion in revenue in 2022. Palantir which builds software to integrate data has a market cap of $29 billion and a more palatable 15x p/s multiplier than when they IPO’d Or how about Alterxy which has an impossibly convoluted vision (hopefully unlike this post): “The company's analytics platform enables organizations to enhance business outcomes and the productivity of their business analysts, data scientists, citizen data scientists, and data engineers.”  
  
But what if sports data is the next liquid gold? Three things need to happen for this to be the case:  
  
Gen Z continue their heightened consumption of data and gamified products   
Sports data becomes harder to obtain with leagues spotting the value in their own data  
AI provides richer experiences for fans and teams and becomes more important to the sport its  
  
So what is sports data?  
  
Sports data refers to the collection and analysis of information related to various sporting events, athletes, teams, and related statistics. It encompasses a wide range of data points, including player performance, team statistics, historical records, injuries, weather conditions, betting odds, and much more. Sports data is gathered from a variety of sources, such as live game feeds, official scorekeepers, sports leagues, broadcasters, and specialized data providers.  
And who owns this data?  
Well, it depends. Sometimes it is the leagues which own their whole value chain and do not outsource their data. The teams or even the athletes can claim ownership to certain data. Sometimes the TV networks purchase and own the data. Finally, sports data companies buy or are licensed to create the leagues’ data. This is where the real money is.   
Who are the key players in this industry?  
In my research, I came across four key companies:  
Sportradar or $SRAD - who dominate market share. To give some comparison, 2022 revenues were $781m, compared to their closest rival Genius Sports or $GENI with $341m. $SRAD own the NBA, NHL and MLB rights.   
$GENI - scheduled to grow at just 15% in 2023, showing their acceleration has slowed. On the positive front, they will be EBITDA contributing in 2023, with $41m booked for 2023.  
IMG Arena - part of the $EDR (Endeavor Group) which owns the UFC. Sports data is only a fraction of their main business  
Stats Perform - not a public company but one of the leaders considering their partnerships with the Premier League  
Take a look at this graphic and how beaten up these stocks are.  
https://ibb.co/v1Q6yPh  
I’m thinking that only a slight shift in the supply metrics could lead to an increase in profits, especially for the market incumbent $SRAD. A boost to their revenues over $1bn in 2023 and a CAGR of 25%, could see a new valuation multiple of 6X revenues instead of the current 3X. I figure the market doesn’t know how to value sports data companies yet. 

  
What are your thoughts on sports data and these companies?

82,Micron Stock Tumbles as China Says Its Chips Are Security Risk,221,13olpot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13olpot/micron_stock_tumbles_as_china_says_its_chips_are/,65,1684747094.0,"Micron Technology Inc.’s stock dropped more than 6% after China’s cyberspace regulator said that its products failed to pass a cybersecurity review in the country.

Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company’s goods, saying it found “relatively serious” cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country. The components caused “significant security risks to our critical information infrastructure supply chain,” which would affect national security, according to the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.Micron’s shares dropped as much as 6.8% in premarket trading, which would be the biggest intraday fall since November if it holds during regular trading. The stock had gained 36% this year, closing at $68.17 on Friday.

The CAC had said about six weeks ago that it was launching a security review of imports from Micron, the US’s last major memory chipmaker.

The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two largest economies, with Washington having already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the Chinese chip industry. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said Beijing’s conclusion had “no basis in fact” and Washington will continue to try and limit industry disruptions with its allies.

“No one should understand this decision by CAC as anything but retaliation for the US’s export controls on semiconductors,” said Holden Triplett, founder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former FBI counterintelligence official in Beijing. “No foreign business operating in China should be deceived by this subterfuge. These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.”

The move brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of chips to the country, which puts the components inside electronic products that are shipped all over the world.

The Chinese cyber agency said in its statement Sunday that, while the country welcomes products and services provided by companies of all countries as long as they comply with its laws and regulations, the investigation into Micron products are a “necessary measure” to safeguard national security. It didn’t detail what the security risks were or identify specific Micron products that are now barred.Micron, which has previously said it stood by the security of its products and commitments to customers, said in a statement Sunday it’s evaluating the conclusion of the review. The company is assessing its next steps, adding that it looks forward “to continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.”

Analysts at Jefferies including Edison Lee said in a research report that the CAC’s decision will likely have a small impact on Micron because it focuses on “critical information infrastructure,” meaning operations like data centers and cloud computing services with security risks. Most of Micron’s memory chips sold in China are actually used in consumer electronics, like smartphones and notebooks, they said.

“We believe this ban is narrowly focused as it applies to only CII operators,” they wrote. “Therefore, the ultimate impact on Micron will be quite limited.”

83,Microsoft Boosts Investment in ChatGPT Parent OpenAI,213,10jghuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10jghuc/microsoft_boosts_investment_in_chatgpt_parent/,33,1674491170.0,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-chatgpt-openai-stock-price-51674488327?mod=hp_LATEST)

Microsoft has agreed to expand its investment in OpenAI, the software company behind the popular artificial intelligence apps [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). 

Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and OpenAI [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) [the expanded investment](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership/) on Monday. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Bloomberg reported that a person familiar with the discussions said the agreement covers $10 billion over multiple years. Microsoft [invested $1 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-artificial-intelligence-startup-11563813648?mod=article_inline) in OpenAI in 2019 and made an additional investment of an undisclosed amount in 2021.

Neither Microsoft nor OpenAI could immediately be reached for comment.

Microsoft said the new agreement “extends our ongoing collaboration across AI supercomputing and research and enables each of us to independently commercialize the resulting advanced AI technologies.” The company added that it will use OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products, and introduce software built on OpenAI technology.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”

OpenAI said in a blog post that the “multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment” will allow the company “to continue our independent research and develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.”

Adding the natural-language capabilities of ChatGPT to Microsoft’s Bing search engine could make it a more formidable competitors to market leader Google, although parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also has made substantial bets on artificial intelligence software, acquiring the AI start-up DeepMind in 2014.

In a research note, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that while Bing holds a smart share of the search engine market, “Microsoft still seeks to gain share vs. Google’s dominant search engine by offering more advanced search capabilities and language models that could take market share away from Google over time.”

Ives also sees applications for the software in Outlook, Office, and videogame software."

You have to tell yourself what these data mean and what they don't mean. Time for a short 🧵 by @Pekao\_Analizy(Analizy Pekao)](https://twitter--thread-com.translate.goog/t/1621538875083575296?_x_tr_sl=pl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

Conclusion:

>Does this mean a recession is certain? History doesn't need to repeat itself: the Fed is reacting faster than it used to, and if it ends hikes in March, it will have time to react; monetary policy transmission may have accelerated; financing conditions have relaxed and the first effects are visible.

85,Canada passed a law compelling Google and Facebook to pay media outlets for links,182,14gf195,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14gf195/canada_passed_a_law_compelling_google_and/,81,1687467938.0,"Now maybe im reading into it wrong, but the Wall Street Journal has an article as stated in the title that Canadian media will now charge a search engine to share their content. The whole idea seems completely absurd. And from the article, apparently something similar happened in 2021 with Australia so Facebook just blocked the media for a week until they caved. Google and Facebook are threatening to just block links to Canada if searched.

This entire thing just seems backwards. Why should a host pay to advertise for another company. Pro regulators are claiming Google and Facebook control the media and are obtaining advertising revenue that would otherwise go to the media. Making them pay to post links would fix that by in a way returning lost revenue from the media advertising. If anything i think it would kill small media outlets that can't afford the pay to play scheme Google would become. US Senate judiciary committee approved a similar bill. If these laws become more widespread, it has greater implications for any business seeking to have any kind of online presence where the financial giants are the only ones you'd find.

Am i ""wrong"" on this or is this just utter lunacy from slowly failing business grasping at whatever they can. When i go to events for my small business, The organizers charge a setup fee to venders to cover the venue and advertising, and i charge customers to buy my product. Venue makes money from me, and i make money from people who would otherwise not even know i existed.

I posted another thread a few days ago gathering your feedback on META, I'd like to do the same for GOOGL.

From my perspective, we're back to levels last seen in March 2021, representing a value play. The P/E is attractive at 19 with a lower PEG vs. peers. Excellent cash flow, manageable debt, etc.

Is there a bear case against GOOGL that we should consider? Or, is it a solid buy at these levels?"
87,Alphabet earnings are out – here are the numbers,178,10s11tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10s11tq/alphabet_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/,114,1675372382.0,"Alphabet reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results 

Earnings per share (EPS): $1.05 vs $1.18 per share expected, according to Refinitiv 

Revenue: $76.05 billion, vs. $76.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:

YouTube advertising revenue: $8.25 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google Cloud revenue: $7.43 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.32 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Google’s core ad business is expected to report minimal expansion from a year earlier, and growth is likely to remain in the single digits until late 2023, based on analyst estimates.

A slowing economy and competition from TikTok have hurt Google as well as digital ad rivals Snap and Facebook. Earlier this week, Snap reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Facebook parent Meta topped estimates but still recorded a 4% decline in sales.

In January, Alphabet announced it was laying off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce. The company told employees recently that more of them will be at risk for low performance ratings than in prior years.

Alphabet also cut staff in its health sciences unit Verily by 15%, citing a restructuring that will supposedly better position the business to seek financial independence.

Pressure is mounting for Google in other ways.

Artificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is viewed as posing a risk to Google’s search engine. Executives teased that the company may introduce a similar product to the public at some point this year. CNBC reported this week that Google is internally experimenting with several potential products that could influence its search business.

In January, the U.S. Justice Department filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, this one targeting its advertising business. It marked the first federal lawsuit against Google filed during the Biden administration.

Google is now showing its willingness to invest heavily in live sports. During the fourth quarter, the company agreed to pay $2 billion per year for the next seven years for YouTube to own the exclusive rights for “NFL Sunday Ticket.”

88,The world's wealthiest people have seen their fortunes grow by more than $150 billion thanks to the AI-fueled stock-market boom,176,14e2plu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14e2plu/the_worlds_wealthiest_people_have_seen_their/,47,1687241197.0,"* AI-related stocks have seen a spectacular surge in 2023, following ChatGPT's smashing debut.  

* Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.  

* Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.

Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 – and it's also helping the rich get richer.  
  
The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.  
  
Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.  
  
That's helped the companies' founders – already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 – to become even wealthier.

Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called ""year of efficiency"" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  
  
Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.  
  
Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.  
  
And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang – has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.

Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.  
  
The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations."

90,"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going",162,145049d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/145049d/how_us_stocks_rose_20_from_their_lows_and_where/,86,1686301620.0,"U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.  
  
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

I can honestly say that around 80-90% of the comments I've seen here about my company make it clear that they have no idea what they're talking about. IMO there are completely legitamite reasons to be either bullish or bearish on my company's stock, but the majority of comments I've read from people about why they've chosen a certain stance make absolutely no sense. Like they make it clear they don't understand how the company makes money, who their customers are, what products they have & how important each one is to the company's bottom line... Every once in a while I see a comment from someone that actually does seem to know what they're talking about (both bear and bull theses) but honestly it's rare. I don't want to get too specific but I've seen tons of comments that to me basically make as much as sense as someone saying something like ""Google's search results have gotten worse lately so they're going under, Yahoo will probably just acquire them anyway.""

97,"Tech Layoffs, Signal?",144,10jrqq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10jrqq8/tech_layoffs_signal/,155,1674518478.0,"There’s been a lot of news about tech layoffs in recent weeks, just thought I’d collate some of the big ones and put some context in as well:

- Google / Alphabet. Ended last year with about 188,000 employees. Announced cuts of 12,000 recently. Leaves them at 175,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. 

- Microsoft. Ended last year with about 221,000 employees. Announced cuts of 10,000 recently. Leaves them at roughly 211,000. Comfortably more headcount than they had in 2021. 

- Facebook / Meta. Ended last year with about 87,000 employees. Announced cuts of 11,000 recently. Leaves them at 76,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. 

So my takeaways are:
- The headlines of ‘woah 10,000 jobs cut’ sound like a lot. And they obviously are and each of those jobs is a person who now is out of work, not minimising that. But in % terms they’re not that big a reduction when you see the context of how big these workforces are.

- All these companies are still comfortably larger in terms of headcount than they were just 2 years ago. Facebook is double the headcount it was in 2018. Google and Microsoft aren’t quite 2x as big but aren’t far off.

- Revenue and profit haven’t fallen at these giant co’s yet but they seem to be cutting in advance of that happening based on their own forecasts or expectations. 

- Obviously there’s plenty more tech companies out there that have announced cuts but these are a decent proxy for the sector cause of their size and cause we can compare where they were 5 years ago to now (cause they’ve been around for a while).

Do you think there’s more layoffs to come? Or is this the end of this little shrinkage / reset of workforce size?"

&#x200B;

eBay is the latest major tech company to lay off workers, having announced that it will lay off 500 employees. That's roughly 4% of the workforce, and according to CEO Jamie Iannone, it's in response to the global recession of the past few months. The chief executive hopes the layoffs will prolong eBay's life and allow it to focus on areas where it can expand but has been coy about those areas. 

The layoffs are the latest round of layoffs in the tech industry, with Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Meta cutting entire jobs in recent months. 

Twitter cut half its workforce. Meta announced 11,000 redundancies, Microsoft let 10,000 employees go and Google axed 12,000 jobs.

Google and Microsoft can and have entered the field of AI technology, the future looks bright and will boost investor confidence. Microsoft has launched its AI version of Bing that uses the technology behind ChatGPT, while Google has announced that it is developing an AI language model to compete with ChatGPT.

Unfortunately, with eBay being an online marketplace platform, it doesn’t have the same opportunity to pivot to the latest AI tech trend. Will this spell harder times ahead for eBay?"

But the new year will likely be the one of “recovery”, a D.A. Davidson analyst said in a note this morning.

Microsoft stock could climb to $270

On Thursday, Gil Luria recommended that investors buy Microsoft stock at the current discount as it has upside to $270, which translates to a more than 20% increase from here.

He’s bullish primarily on the tech behemoth’s $1.0 billion investment in OpenAI – an artificial intelligence research lab that operates “ChatGPT”.   

Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside. Longer-term, incorporating ChatGPT into Bing may provide MSFT with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance.

A day earlier, “The Information” said Microsoft was working with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into its flagship search engine.

OpenAI investment to benefit Azure as well

Interestingly, the D.A. Davidson analyst doesn’t expect OpenAI to benefit “Bing” only. In fact, Azure – its cloud platform stands to benefit just as much from the said investment. His note reads:

We’ve heard estimates between $250 million to $1.0 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI, much of which is being spent on Azure. We expect those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of GPT 4.0 later this year and the many product offshoots that’ll link to OpenAI via APIs.

In just over a month of its launch, ChatGPT has surpassed 1.0 million in terms of user count. Luria is also convinced that the multinational is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn (find out more).

The Nasdaq-listed firm is set to report its Q2 results later this month. Consensus is for it to earn $2.28 a share versus the year-ago $2.48. Versus its high in mid-August, Microsoft stock is down about 25% at writing."

>*For transparency, labor relations, adherence to governance, for example, having a CEO who doesn’t send out random tweets, Tesla scores poorly*  
*\[Tesla’s 2019 impact statement\] “was not exactly a statement that endeared Tesla to those who create ESG scores”*

>Musk is correct about the oil companies here, two oil companies ([OMV AG: 27.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/omv-ag/1008289354) and [Repsol: 26.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/repsol-s-a/1008201748)) both have better scores than Tesla.  
>  
>The key problem here is that E,S and G are all weighted equally, while not close to being equal in practice. E can be quantified, while S and G are entirely subjective. The equal weighting of each metric means that companies outstanding in one area are beaten out by seemingly much worse companies overall because of the other two dimensions.  
>  
>The scores also don’t account for the wider impact that a company might have had, for example Tesla isn’t given get credit for helping to push other automakers towards EV’s.

>  
>*He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by* [*Refinitive ESG*](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3579819-1&h=2880314828&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&a=Refinitive+ESG)*, which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years — one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 — the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.*  
*He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 — just six weeks apart — and found that 85% of firms’ scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.*  
>  
> *Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&S score on the firm’s future stock returns. These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies.* 

ESG FUNDS:

>*Sector exposures across the funds revealed that information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, and an almost zero allocation in energy. This was one of the key drivers behind the shorter-term recent outperformance of ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 whilst energy declined.*  
>  
>So the overperformance of ESG funds compared to a wide index was because they are tech heavy.  
>  
>*Google was the most commonly held stock across most funds; Alphabet Inc. was in 12 funds, with an average weight of 1.9% . The companies with the highest average weight across the funds were Apple (5.6%) and Microsoft (5.0%)*  
>  
>So ESG funds are basically investing in the same things that most other funds do: Tech (FAANG) and industrials, with very little, if any allocation towards energy. This is permissible by their rules because all of these companies have good ESG scores. Afterall their CEO’s don’t tweet.

109,Is it fair to say that SP500 growth could just be a march towards monopolies?,107,10aif3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10aif3t/is_it_fair_to_say_that_sp500_growth_could_just_be/,34,1673576480.0,"This is something that I think about from time to time, but haven't ever seen it discussed.

Imagine that there are 1,000 companies in a country, each with an identical market cap of $1M. The SP500 in this theoretical economy would be $500M (say they have some clever way of picking the ""top"" 500). Then imagine that each company in the SP500 completely steals 100% market cap from one of the other 500 companies. Now each company in the top 500 has a market cap of $2M, and the SP500 index has increased a full 100%! This seems very exciting, and everyone who invested in one of those original companies, or some SP500 index fund, has doubled their investments, and the ""economy is twice as large."" However, no real value has been created, since this was a zero sum game.

Now I'm not claiming that the US economy operates in a zero sum game, and I do believe that real value growth happens almost every year. However, when I look at how much of the SP500 is attributable to Apple, Microsoft, and Google, I have to wonder how much SP ""growth"" is Apple stealing market cap from viable smartphone competitors, etc. Even if you were to measure the entire stock market--the market cap of all publicly-traded companies, you'd still be attributing ""growth"" to public companies stealing market cap from private companies, mom-and-pop shops, etc.

Furthermore, due to the increase of passive investing, there is a self-fulfilling cycle, where the companies that have stolen more market cap are having the value of their shares inflated by people like me who just passively throw my savings into an index fund. This gives their company a higher value, and allows them to raise more cash, higher better developers at a lower ""price,"" etc.

I'm not condemning the system, but I'm interested in having a discussion about how we talk about growth. I'm sure people much smarter than me have made attempts at calculating the actual growth, and I'd love to talk about those efforts."
110,Dropbox analysis and valuation - The free cash flow is not so free,111,w15mxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w15mxb/dropbox_analysis_and_valuation_the_free_cash_flow/,46,1658058419.0,"Dropbox is a company that's been public for less than 4 years and the price today ($21.74) isn't that far from its IPO price of $21.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, provide insights about the key topics and value the company as a whole. The purpose is purely for education.

&#x200B;

**What is Dropbox?**

It is a cloud storage solution where content can be accessed from anywhere and shared with others. Today, with all the storage alternatives that we have and the progress that has been done in this field, well, it doesn't sound as revolutionary as it did 15 years ago.

&#x200B;

**The key numbers**

As it is a subscription-based platform, the number of users plays a big role. This is what a lot of analysts pay attention to and although they look at the exact same numbers, they end up with different conclusions about the future of Dropbox.

\#1 - Registered users - Over 700m! - This is the first big number to focus on. This number is roughly 10% of the world population, so they are able to reach a lot of people.

\#2 - Paying users - 17m - Wait, is that a typo, that's only 2.5% of the total users. No, it is not a typo. Only 2.5% of the registered Dropbox users are actually paying users.

The question is, can they convert more users to become paying? Do you trust in their ability to do that? Here's when the analysts are clashing. On one side, the bulls are painting the picture of a future where the conversion is high, while the bears are asking the question where will this conversion start? This is a fair question as the users were there last year, the year before, and the year before...

&#x200B;

**The financials**

The revenue formula is simple, **# of paying users** multiplied by the **average revenue per user**. Both of these numbers have been increasing and that reflects in the total revenue. The users, we already touched upon that earlier and it is clear that it depends on their ability to convert. The average revenue per user depends on their ability to either charge more for their existing service (which is tough, as their competitors are all giants - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and their ability to create new product offerings (through R&D or through acquisitions).

However, the growth of the revenue has been declining. From **19%** growth in 2019 to **15%** growth in 2020, to **13%** growth in 2021...

What about the pandemic? With the huge change from the traditional working environment to the remote/work-from-home, yet, surely the demand for this is surging. When I started analyzing Dropbox, I was expecting to see a surge in the revenue, so seeing that it isn't there, I was a bit disappointed.

As for the margins, they keep improving over time:

\- Gross margin improved from 72% in 2018 to 80% in 2021. The cost of service represents the expenses associated with the storage, delivery & distribution of the platform/services, not only to the paying but also to the free users. so, free users burn some of Dropbox's cash.

All the operating expenses decreased as % of revenue between 2018 and 2021:

\- R&D from 55% to 34%

\- Sales & Marketing from 32% to 20%

\- G&A from 20% to 20%

So the operating margin improved from -35% to 13%. Is there room to grow? Yes, absolutely. Based on the management's guidance, they can improve at least an additional 7% in the future, hence, the margin will be over 20%. On top of that, the investments that they make in the equipment cost them less than the historical amounts that they've paid, so the margin will increase even further over time.

&#x200B;

**The key topic - the cash!**

One of the topics that you'll notice appearing most, especially around bull analysts is the free cash flow of the company and the expected increase in the coming years.

The free cash flow grew from $392m in 2019 to $491m in 2020, to $708m in 2021, and is expected to reach $1b in 2024!

The market cap today is roughly $8b. So, that's roughly 12.5% free cash flow yield (2024 is not that far, so I'm simplifying this). In theory, if Dropbox is not growing at all, and just pays the $1b out to the shareholders, that should bring a 12.5% return every single year, right? Well, not really.

We need to step back to better understand this. The free cash flow formula is quite simple:

Free cash flow = Operating cash flow - Capital expenditures

It represents **the cash that is free for the management** to decide what to do with it, whether that is buying back shares, paying it out as a dividend, acquiring a new company, or, well, just nothing yet.

As this is looking through the prism of cash and it doesn't take share-based compensation (it is not a cash movement) and it doesn't take acquisitions (Dropbox had 2 of them in the last 3 years, totaling over $300m) because that depends on management's decisions.

You might be wondering, well, isn't acquisition capital expenditure? It definitely falls in the same category, but free cash flow doesn't represent what's free to distribute to the shareholders. Again, it is the free cash flow left **for the management** to decide what to do with it.

If you notice, the free cash flows mentioned above are quite far from their operating result. The main reason is stock-based compensation, which is huge! It is roughly $300m/year. What does this mean?

Part of the employee compensation is not paid in cash, but in stock options/shares. This is not a cash expense, hence, looking through the cash lense, it just isn't there.

If Dropbox wants to maintain the number of shares outstanding, it would need to spend the $300m and buy back shares. Have they been doing that? Yes! The number of shares decreased by roughly 10% in the last 3 years. But it wasn't free, it cost them over $1.6b!

This is important to understand, so whenever we encounter free cash flow, we don't assume that's what is free for us as investors, because it isn't. The free cash flow for the investors is a lot lower.

&#x200B;

**The valuation**

I used a DCF model to estimate the value of Dropbox. Below are my assumptions:

**- Revenue**: To increase 7% per year in the next 5 years, then slowly decline to 3%. - In line with the average analysts' expectation.

**- Operating margin:** To increase to 24% over the next 5 years.

**- Discount rate:** 6.7% to increase over time to 9.64% to reflect the environment that we're in today (with the FED increasing rates)

\- **Outcome:** $14.82/share

The DCF takes into account the $1.5b in cash and $2.4b debt that is on their balance sheet (As of Q1/2022) and the $650m equity options outstanding.

&#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 75% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 24%. I could significantly be wrong in my assessment.

Let's take a look at how the valuation of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|22%|24%|26%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|50% ($3.3b)|$11.4|$12.7|$14.0|
|75% ($3.9b)|$13.3|$14.8|$16.3|
|120% ($4.9b)|$16.6|$18.4|$20.3|
|150% ($5.5b)|$18.2|$20.2|$22.2|

**My thoughts**

Dropbox is operating in a fairly competitive field and the fact that it couldn't significantly grow during the pandemic shows that the alternatives are more appealing.

The # of registered users is definitely a huge number, but unless they are monetized, it doesn't add value.. Can they convert a significant portion? Based on the historical data, there's not enough proof, hence I do not feel comfortable including that wishful thinking in my forecast.

I am looking forward to reading your views about the company and feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis, that is always appreciated!"

If the deal goes through Microsoft will buys out Activision shareholders for $95/per share.  Activision shares currently go for around $76. 
 That’s roughly give or take a 20% gain on your investment. 

I hear the Microsoft Activision deal should be settled by summer 2023. I feel like this may be a good opportunity to load up on Activision shares however, I am relatively new to the stock market so some of your views on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  

I’m assuming however, the downside of this opportunity may be that the deal does not execute and you are stuck holding on to crappy Activision shares which may potentially drop in value according to some analysis I came across on google."

113,Google accuses Microsoft of unfair practices in Azure cloud unit,108,14ff0kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14ff0kv/google_accuses_microsoft_of_unfair_practices_in/,46,1687371080.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/google-accuses-microsoft-of-anticompetitive-practices-in-azure-cloud.html

Google, which has spent years defending itself against claims of monopolistic behavior across the U.S. and Europe, is going public with its own complaint of anti-competitive practices by longtime rival Microsoft. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday, Google alleged Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in clients” to exert control over the cloud-computing market. The letter was sent in response to a broad FTC request for comment on potential anti-competitive acts in the cloud industry. A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment further.

Google singled out Microsoft in the complaint, arguing that through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Offices products, the company can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering. Google described Microsoft’s licensing restrictions as a “complex web” that prevents businesses from diversifying their enterprise software vendors. Google also said such control represents a significant national security and cybersecurity risk. It highlighted successive cyberattacks involving Microsoft products, including the SolarWinds breach. Microsoft and Google both have active cybersecurity practices that respond to and research cyber threats. Google is no stranger to antitrust concerns. In January, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, targeting its advertising business.

The department’s earlier lawsuit, filed in October 2020 under the Trump administration, accused Google of using monopoly power to cut off competition for internet search through exclusionary agreements. That case is expected to go to trial in September. Google also faces three other antitrust lawsuits from large groups of state attorneys general, including one focused on its advertising business led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In its FTC letter, Microsoft also alleged Oracle’s practices are harmful to customers. “With overly complex agreements that seek to lock in clients to their ecosystems,” Google said, companies such as Microsoft and Oracle “are not only forcing customers toward a monolithic cloud model but also limiting choice, increasing costs for customers, and disrupting growing and thriving digital ecosystems in the U.S. and around the world.”"

●There are low chances that you will be the next Burry. 

●Don't time the market. June proved to many that they suck at timing the market, while people who timed it right; congrats and ...you know what. Enjoy your luck. Don't fomo puts, because you can get burned like bears couple of weeks ago. I still remember people saying that ""it can't get any higher, it will crash next Monday, Im buying puts"" to just see market showing them big green middle finger.

●Red days after such rally are healthy, so don't act like it's the begging of the big crash. It can crash or go sideways, definitely it will go to the right. That's all we know. Don't rush things and buy puts asap after reading one youtube video or a few comments on Reddit.

●You will compete on the whole different level than just buy/sell shares strategy... If you need advice whether you should buy Apple or Meta, or if you should buy now or during crash, then most probably options are not for you. If you don't believe me, Google why retailers are losing on options.

●""Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" is exactly about playing puts. 

●If you get rock solid seeing these massive gains from puts, jerk off for the post nut clarity, then read about the survivorship bias. 

Happy to see others opinions. Use puts responsibly or go yolo to post a massive gain/loss for some reddit awards in that place. Its up to you, but please don't post another ""I learnt my lesson"", because it's nothing interesting and groundbreaking."

117,Apple to Make Small Number of Job Cuts in Some Corporate Retail Teams,95,12b074i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12b074i/apple_to_make_small_number_of_job_cuts_in_some/,13,1680560838.0,"Apple Inc. is eliminating a small number of roles within its corporate retail teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking its first known internal job cuts since it embarked on a belt-tightening effort last year. 

The company is shedding positions in what it calls its development and preservation teams, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced. Those groups are responsible for the construction and upkeep of Apple retail stores and other facilities around the world.

While the number of positions being eliminated couldn’t be ascertained and is likely very small, the move represents a new step for the world’s most valuable company, whose peers have been slashing their ranks in the face of a shaky economy and sluggish consumer spending.

Apple is positioning the move as a streamlining effort, rather than layoffs. It told employees that the changes were designed to improve upkeep of stores globally and that the company will provide support to affected workers.


The iPhone maker has largely held off on corporate layoffs, even as it trims budgets and pares back much of its contractor workforce, including on-contract engineers, recruiters and security guards. The company previously cut corporate jobs before the pandemic, when it eliminated a couple hundred members of its self-driving car division.

With the latest move, Apple told employees in those groups that they would have the ability to reapply for a number of roles similar to their prior jobs. Those who don’t take a new role will get as much as four months of pay, the people said.

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.

Apple’s Workforce Has Grown Steadily Over the Past Decade

The company avoided the hiring surge of some peers during the pandemic

Sources: Company reports, Bloomberg
Some management roles are also being eliminated. While those employees could be rehired as so-called individual contributors, they may not have the same compensation, according to the people. In a few instances, some employees are exempt and will keep their jobs without needing to reapply.


Apple had 164,000 employees as of September, when its last fiscal year ended. The company didn’t expand its workforce as quickly as many big tech companies during the pandemic, decreasing the need for major layoffs. Its peers, including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, have cut tens of thousands of jobs.

He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.  
  
“What do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,” Shmulik wrote.

The analysts also pointed to Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company’s search advertising business. SGE is Google’s experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft’s Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.

“We recognize that \[Google’s\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,” Walmsley wrote in a research note. “But our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‘old’ Google…which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.”  
  
Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet’s margins.  
  
The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union’s European Commission to break up Google’s massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws."
121,Microsoft is beating Google at its own game,93,10n347x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10n347x/microsoft_is_beating_google_at_its_own_game/,152,1674871341.0,"Microsoft appears to be on the cusp of being something it hasn’t been in a long time: cutting-edge. It’s a label the company lost a long time ago after a series of small startups grew to become Microsoft’s biggest competitors. Google, for example, started out as a nimble, innovative upstart and eventually bested Microsoft in browsers, email, and mobile operating systems. But now Microsoft might be the nimble, innovative company that bests Google in artificial intelligence. And it’s all thanks to OpenAI.

OpenAI is the hottest AI lab out there with one of the buzziest and most exciting products: ChatGPT. And Microsoft is its very good friend. On Monday, the two companies announced that Microsoft was investing $10 billion into OpenAI (that’s on top of the $3 billion Microsoft has given OpenAI since 2019), and Microsoft is rumored to be adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Yeah, that’s right: The much-maligned, little-used Bing might finally become a real competitor to Google’s search.

Following the news of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that ChatGPT is a “potential game changer” for Microsoft, and that the company was “not going to repeat the same mistakes” of missing out on social and mobile that it made two decades ago. Microsoft “is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind,” Ives wrote.

There are parallels here, at least on the surface. Microsoft was once the dominant player in computer technology, with its Windows operating system being used by the vast majority of personal computers and its Internet Explorer browser being used by the vast majority of web surfers. And then it got in trouble with the US government, which sued Microsoft for using its dominant position to unfairly drive out competition and take over the then-nascent browser market by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. The lawsuit tied up Microsoft for years. In that environment, companies like Google emerged, putting out better products that people preferred in an exponentially growing market.

Microsoft still did just fine — it remains one of the most valuable companies in the world and is still more valuable than Google — but it doesn’t have the same consumer-facing cachet it did before. Its enterprise clients drive the vast majority of its revenue, through products like Microsoft 365 and Azure. Google, by contrast, is very visible to and much-used by the general consumer, owning everything from Chrome to Gmail to YouTube. Its main revenue source is the digital ads that consumers see as they navigate the internet, and the majority of them are using Google services while they do it.

But now Google is the company that’s having antitrust issues, facing multiple lawsuits from the federal government and almost every state and territory in the country that target core parts of its business, including one that was filed just yesterday. Those may well clear the way for Microsoft to be the leader in a burgeoning industry with a ton of potential: AI. Companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements in the technology and are now showing it off to the general public, while Google’s competing products are practically nowhere to be found beyond updates on Google’s blog. (Microsoft isn’t entirely in the clear, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently trying to block its massive merger with the gaming company Activision Blizzard, but it’s in a much better position, antitrust-wise.)

That’s not to say that Google doesn’t recognize AI’s potential and increasing importance. It’s been working on AI offerings for years, and has some of the best ones. It acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, before OpenAI even existed. And it developed the Transformer technology that ChatGPT is built on (GPT stands for Generative Prediction Transformer).

But Google has held back on giving them the kind of public demonstration that OpenAI has, saying it wants to ensure that its products are responsible and safe before unleashing them. Not helping matters was a claim from a (now-former) engineer that Google’s chatbot technology, LaMDA, had become sentient. That’s been widely dismissed (and denied by Google), but it underlined how advanced the technology has become. And it showed the risks not of the technology becoming sentient, but of it being so good that people would think it was and start to treat it as such.

Now that ChatGPT is out there, Google has to play catch-up and figure out how it wants to integrate its AI technology into its own offerings. It’s even, reportedly, brought back founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help out. The company also recently published a paper outlining its approach to AI and how important it is for that approach to be responsible (or Google’s definition of responsible, given the lack of government regulations).

“Google is, I think, justified and correct in taking this seriously and taking Microsoft’s bid to use this tech to seriously compete with them in advertising, search engines, and other products,” said Derek Leben, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s business school who focuses on AI ethics. “I think this is a very brilliant move from [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella. This is something that is definitely going to position Microsoft very well.”

But, Leben warned, there remains the question of whether the benefits of these products outweigh their risks — and if rushing them to market to compete will enhance those risks.

“That is indeed the problem with arms races,” he said. “They tend to motivate actors in them to move faster, and accept risks that they otherwise would not have accepted.”

Maybe OpenAI’s technology is a game changer. Maybe it’s just a party trick. Either way, Microsoft’s got it, and a lot of people think it’s amazing. That perception is important. Google now finds itself in a similar position that it helped put Microsoft in two decades ago: hoping it can release something better before it gets passed by.

122,Uber stock analysis and valuation - The disruptor,95,122v543,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/122v543/uber_stock_analysis_and_valuation_the_disruptor/,43,1679855650.0,"This week's stock analysis and valuation is Uber.

I hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to add your take and agree/disagree with what's mentioned below.

&#x200B;

The post is divided into the following sections:

* Introduction
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* Management's guidance
* Assumptions & valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

Although Uber doesn't really need an introduction, I'll keep it short: It is a company that is disrupting the transportation industry. It is operating in 3 segments:

1. Mobility (Ridesharing, carsharing, micro-mobility, rentals)
2. Delivery (food and small packages - via Uber Eats / Postmates)
3. Freight transport

I wasn't that familiar with its freight transport, but in a nutshell, it is not significantly different in its technology compared to the other two.

All three segments are related to transportation. The first one - is the transportation of human beings, the second one - is the transportation of food / small packages, and the last one - is the transportation of goods via trucks.

What I was surprised about was how much Uber has changed over the last 5 years. To illustrate the change, take a look at the % of the revenue of the 3 segments in 2018 vs 2022:

Mobility: 83.8% --> 44.0%

Delivery: 13.0% --> 34.2%

Freight: 3.2% --> 21.8%

&#x200B;

Mobility increased in absolute terms but is overshadowed by the growth of the other two segments.

Despite COVID-19, Uber managed to not only grow in size (which will be shown in the next segment) but also become a more diversified business than any of its competitors.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

Between 2018 and 2022, the revenue grew at a CAGR of 30% (vs. Lyft - a CAGR of 17%) increasing from $11.3b to $31.9b.

Not only that its top line grew at an impressive rate, but the company also managed to reduce its operating expenses as % of revenue from 77% down to 44%. (For comparison, Lyft's operating expenses reduced from 88% --> 76% in the same period)

However, the gross margin is around 38% and is currently not sufficient to cover all the operating expenses of 44%, leading to a negative operating margin of 6%. (vs. Lyft negative 36%). 

Analysts project the company passes the break-even point from an operating point in 2023.

&#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

Uber has kept above $4 billion in cash historically and is no stranger not only in acquiring companies but also in making investments. As of December 31st, 2022, its significant investments were:

\- $1.8 billion in Didi (Chinese transportation company)

\- $1.7 billion in Grab (Singaporean tech company involved in transportation, food delivery, and digital payments)

\- $1.6 billion in government securities

\- $0.9 billion in MLU BV (Joint venture with Yandex - The google of Russia) - In February it was announced that Yandex will buy the remaining ownership, so Uber will receive around $1b for it.

&#x200B;

On the other side of the balance sheet, there are 3 topics that I'd like to point out:

1. $11 billion in debt (including leases) - not extremely high comparing it to its market cap of $62 billion.
2. $5 billion liability related to insurance reserves - I will be deducting it from my valuation
3. $3 billion in accrued expenses related to legal, regulatory, drivers, and merchants liability - Same as above, I'll be deducting it from my valuation

The reason why I'm deducting points 2 and 3 is: These are recurring expenses that Uber faces and the company is deferring them from one period to the other. However, they have been incurred already. I do not do this for accounts receivable/payable as those are normally comparable in size and set off each other. However, a total of $8 billion cannot be ignored. At least, this is my approach.

&#x200B;

**Management's guidance**

Back in February of 2022, Uber had investor day and in the presentation, the management mentioned its long-term target to reach an adjusted EBITDA of 25%.

Any time that you read adjusted, my advice is to try to understand what is being adjusted. In the annual report, you can always find more information about it, including a reconciliation between the net result and this ""Adjusted EBITDA"", which is nothing else but an alternative profitability measure defined by the management.

In theory, to get from the net result to EBITDA, all one needs to do is add back, the interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. However, here's what else Uber is adding back that is significant (which leads to the EBIDTA being adjusted):

\- Stock-based compensation (roughly 5% of revenue - although a non-cash expense, it is an expense to the existing shareholders)

\- Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements (I argue that these are normal and recurring expenses and should not be added back)

&#x200B;

When I try to assess the company's profitability, I try to estimate the EBIT in its pure form (the operating profitability). If I start with the management's target of 25% and I adjusted for Depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and the expenses that I find recurring, the EBIT that the management is targeting is around 14%.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions & valuation**

As I am using my analysis to act upon them, I am always using a bit more conservative assumptions than the analysts (and the management). Here are my assumptions:

1. **Revenue growth** \- 15% for the next 2 years, then decreasing to 10% by year 5 and further decreasing to 4% by year 10 (leading to revenue growth of 130% in 10 years time)
2. **Operating margin** \- Breaking even in 2023, increasing to 8% by year 5 and then to 10% by year 10
3. **Discount rate -** 11% (WACC-based) decreasing to 10.4% by year 10

&#x200B;

After adjusting for what I've mentioned above related to the balance sheet (cash, debt, other liabilities) and the equity options outstanding, the value of Uber is **$31.6 billion ($15.7/share).**

For comparison, at the moment, its market cap is $61.8 billion ($30.75/share)

&#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|8%|10%|12%|14%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|100% ($63.7b)|$9.6|$13.3|$16.6|$20.0|
|130% ($73.5b)|$11.4|$15.7|$19.6|$23.4|
|175% ($87.6b)|$13.9|$19.0|$23.6|$28.1|
|200% ($95.7b)|$15.1|$20.7|$25.7|$30.6|

Based on the table above, the market is valuing Uber as if it is going to reach the 14% EBIT that the management is targeting and grow its revenue by 200% over the next decade.

In my opinion, Uber has a great business and it has proven that it can expand both in different segments and geographically and is extremely close to becoming a profitable business.

I personally do not own any shares of Uber at this moment, but I am open to having it part of my portfolio if the price goes down to a more acceptable level. This is not financial advice, just a disclaimer.

As always, thank you for reading the post, and until next week for the next valuation!"

125,Google Stock is Approaching Buffett 10x EBT Levels (viewed by the market as a terminally stagnating business),92,10mucgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10mucgb/google_stock_is_approaching_buffett_10x_ebt/,71,1674849395.0,"Source: Google Shouldn't Be, But Approaches, A Buffett 10x EBT Stock

The argument in this article is quite simple: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (""Google"") is undervalued based on the Buffett 10x EBT (earnings before taxes) rule. It is selling at a valuation of around 13x FW EBT only after its cash position is adjusted. At such a valuation, the market essentially views Google as a terminally stagnating business. A 13x FW EBT already provides close to 8% of pretax earnings earning yield, making it equivalent to owning an equity bond with a similar yield (bond yields are all quoted on a pretax basis). Any growth will be a bonus at this valuation.

To be more specific, as of this writing, Google's stock price is about $98 per share. And my estimate for its 2023 EPS is about $5.8 per share and its tax rate is about 14%. And finally, do not forget that it has about $9 of net cash position sitting on its balance sheet (more on this later). Putting all these numbers together, its current valuations turn out to be ~13x FW EBT after the cash position is subtracted from its stock price.

At such a valuation, Google is essentially viewed by the market as a terminally stagnating business, according to Buffett's 10x EBT rule."

If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. 

Now for the meat and potatoes. What will you be buying up when the news eventually comes out that we are no longer having severe inflation problems? The perfect scenario would be Jerome Powell announces ""we are no longer going to remain hawkish, inflation is now under control ..."" and the rest will be history. Here is a breakdown of my portfolio picks when that day comes, which remember could be in a few months or in 2024, hell it could even be in 2026 for all I know. Right now my portfolio is about 95% cash. I will breakdown and explain each of these holdings: 

25% of portfolio will be in VOO - VOO is the lazy, set it and forget it ETF. It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. 

20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. 

10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? 

10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. 

8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. 

8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. 

7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. 

2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago. 

10% of portfolio will be in cash to do swing trading."

I just don't see the point in holding my MSFT and stuff.

I got in MSFT at $220 and my AAPL is basis $103 but I feel by October MSFT will be at $150 and AAPL will be at $80 or less so I'd rather get out now.

I'm still negative so I'll have no tax consequences, but I'll have wash sales but that's no.biggie for me.

I'll keep my UNH since I'm up 54% since buying it 1.6 years ago and probably keep things like UNP NEE COST and my ENPH.

So anyone else selling all their tech?

I just think MSFT and AAPL will be going down at ver least 50% so why lose money when I can just buy in lower?

I like MSFT and AAPL, but I think tech will get crushed now.

So basically I'm 50% cash and maybe gonna up to 70% cash or so till end of October maybe.

Good luck all! Keep the faith!

We'll get through this!"

Microsoft AI Bing appears to be significantly more useful than Google’s search engine in terms of less clutter and better to the point results. 

Since Google pays Apple an estimated 20billion per year to be the default search engine on IOS, Apple has the most powerful position in this war. They can easily negotiate a new contract with Microsoft. This will absolutely destroy Google’s business. The only way for Google to maintain its position as the default browser would be to pay more than Microsoft or invest heavily into the technology. Either way, their margins get hit. 
Microsoft has nothing to lose but some of its massive cash position. But the obstacle stopping mass adoption of Bing would be Apple’s position as Judge, Jury and Executioner. 

My thoughts going forward? Apple is the king, and this further proves it. Whilst Google and Microsoft fight for search, Apple laughs at the two companies whilst it attaches any price tag it wants for the default browser. So Apple is the only company that’s currently profiting from the war. If GOOG or MSFT don’t pay up, AAPL can go create their own search engine and seamlessly integrate it into their devices. My conviction in Apple is now stronger."

130,"Apple indefinitely postpones its lightweight AR glasses, planning a lower-cost MR headset for 2024 or 2025",75,10f7ibv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10f7ibv/apple_indefinitely_postpones_its_lightweight_ar/,33,1674048807.0,"
Apple Inc. is still planning to unveil its first mixed-reality headset this year, but an even more important follow-up product — lightweight augmented-reality glasses — has been postponed due to technical challenges. 

The company had originally hoped to release the AR glasses after the debut of its mixed-reality headset, which combines both AR and virtual reality, but that part of the plan is now on hold. Instead, Apple will follow up with a lower-cost version of the mixed-reality headset as soon as 2024 or early 2025, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

The shifting plans underscore the challenges Apple faces in pushing into a new industry. The company is betting that AR and VR devices could be a major moneymaker, but the technical challenges of producing a consumer-friendly product has bedeviled much of the tech world. Apple’s initial dream of offering a lightweight pair of AR glasses that people could wear all day now appears many years away — if it happens at all.

VR headsets — a market currently dominated by Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. — offer a more immersive experience, with people typically using them to play video games, communicate in virtual meeting rooms and watch video. AR glasses, in contrast, overlay visuals and information on real-world views. The hope is that users could wear such glasses as they go about a normal day, but earlier attempts at the concept — such as Google Glass — haven’t gained traction.

High cost also could make an Apple mixed-reality headset more of a niche product. The initial mixed-reality device due this year will cost around $3,000. The hefty price stems from its use of advanced and high-resolution displays, more than 10 cameras, sensors to determine where a user is looking, and the use of both a Mac-grade M2 processor and a dedicated chip for handling AR and VR visuals.

Apple is aiming to lower the price of the follow-up mixed-reality device by using chips on par with those in the iPhone rather than components found in higher-end Macs computers. The company will be competing with Meta’s mixed-reality headset, which costs $1,500. That’s a price Apple may strive to get closer to with its lower-end model.

Trademark filings made by Apple hint at the dual device strategy. The documents have included the names “Reality Pro” and “Reality One.” The Pro name is likely for the initial model, while the “One” suffix could be under consideration for the cheaper version. There also is a trademark filing for “Reality Processor,” hinting at the name for the dedicated chip.

The company is focusing on the lower-cost headset instead of the AR glasses, which were once planned to be released about a year after the initial headset, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is still under wraps. At one point, Apple aimed to release the glasses in 2023, before delaying the launch until around 2025. Now, Apple has postponed the rollout indefinitely and pared back its work on the AR device.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans. 

Apple’s mixed-reality headset will use displays to create an all-encompassing VR environment and pass-through cameras to mimic an AR effect. That’s a lot less complicated than the technology needed to make an AR-only device that looks similar to normal glasses.

Apple ultimately sees less-cumbersome AR glasses as a product that could replace the iPhone by moving the smartphone’s main functions to a wearer’s field of view. Such a device could let users see incoming notifications, get maps directions, make and take phone calls, or snap photos right from their face.

But finding the right chips, batteries, software and manufacturing to create a lightweight product that can last all day isn’t on the horizon yet. Apple’s first high-end headset will last about two hours on one charge. A phone, in contrast, can usually last the whole day or longer. 

The headset’s battery also will be cumbersome, with the company choosing to not include it in the device itself to reduce the weight and heating risks of the head-worn product. The battery will connect to the headset over a cable and rest in a user’s back pocket. Creating a lightweight device with advanced augmented reality and a built-in battery that could last all day isn’t feasible with today’s technology.
The vast majority of Apple’s Technology Development Group — the 1,000 person-plus unit dedicated to AR and VR — is focused on the first two mixed-reality headsets. But the company still has some teams exploring technologies that would go into standalone glasses, should they eventually launch. 

Some people within Apple doubt that the company will ever ship AR glasses, but it remains a long-term goal. Meta and and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have both announced their own plans for AR glasses, but those products also remain in early stages."

There’s no sugarcoating it, Cathy Wood’s Ark Funds got clobbered, her strategy does work in the current environment. I’m not arguing that she’s the best fund manager of all time. No risk management

I’m just looking at the stocks in ARKK such as Zoom, Tesla, Block, Shopify, Teladoc, Roku, etc. and asking myself do we really think these stocks won’t be around 5 years from now? 

These stocks are all down like 80% or more from ATHs and a lot of these stocks are trading well below pre-pandemic levels 

The bottom for the  S&P 500 and QQQ was around September 2002 during the dot.com bubble, and March 2009 for the financial crisis. 

Apple, which was more speculative back then before it was the tech giant today, bottomed in 12/2000 and 12/2008.

 Netflix bottomed in 7/2007. 

Google bottomed in 11/2008. 

Amazon bottomed in 9/2001 and 11/2008. 

The point is that high-growth, more speculative tech companies hit their bottom months or up to a year before the broad index funds. 

To outperform the market you need to be doing something radically different

Everyone gave up on Cathy’s stocks a while ago and the the sentiment towards her and her strategies are sooo negative right now. It may soon be time to buy the fear. To follow the herd is to buy high and sell low after that 2020 stimulus bubble in equities 


Cathy may be a fool in this market cycle, but how the f$ck are you people not buying at least a few shares of these ARK funds? It’s much closer to a bottom than the broad index funds"

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&P 500 goes below 4000.

&#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

Disclaimer: I am long index funds and GOOGL. I also hold couple QQQ puts for hedging which got burned."

# Some Briefing

I made adjustments and fixed some numbers from my last analysis. The Final Price is the average of all the evaluation methods listed.

* *Graham Fair Value Formula*
* *CFO Evaluation*
* *Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow*
* *Dividend Discount Model*
* *Total Payout Valuation Model*

**Changes from the previous post:**

* **Use of Annual Data**: In the last one I used quarterly data and forecasted it as it was annual lol (what an idiot)
* **Use of Unlevered Free Cash Flow**: I used Free Cash flow to do DCF in the last one
* **Use of Growth Rate calculated by me**
* **Tax of 8.46%** calculated by me, in the last one i just guessed one randomly loool
* **Fixed Unlevered Beta**: Used MCap and Long tern & Short Term Debt to calculate Unlevered Beta instead of using Shareholders Equity

**Final Introductory Notes:**

* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis
* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%
* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!
* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).
* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho is calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.
* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol
* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong. Is is calculated on FCF of 9,662,000 thousands and Cash & Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands :/

# Ratios

*Quick Note: this is just indicative, i know i need more ratios and i need to compare them with industry and competitors to better have an adjusted commentary on Intel's ratios, in the next post i will add more ratios like: ROIC, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Payable Turnover, Debt to Equity, Quick Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio, Price to Book ratio, P/E etc (this list is not biding, some ratio listed could be not included), i will try to compare some with its historical variations.*

|Ratio|Numbers|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Working Capital**|2.10|The company can cover its short term expenses with its current assets|
|**Acid Test**|0.18|The company cannot cover its short term expenses with only its cash and cash equivalents|

Note: The Ratios section can be skipped.

# Risk Analysis

Following are factors that can impact the company Free Cash Flow:

* **Inflation rate increases**: Last Month's inflation decreased just a little bit, but that doesn't indicate that it will plunge soon, high probability to see it increase in the near future.
* **Unanticipated effects of interest rate hikes**: We know that the FED is trying everything to fight inflation, even spending and injecting more cash in the economy! We expected the last rates hike, and we expect another one soon.
* **Geopolitical events**: one word: \*reads it with Trump's voice\* ***China!***
* **Sales forecast, cost estimates, and cash conversion cycle inaccuracy**: It is forecasted by Intel itself a decrease on sales for the next near future due to demand decrease.
* **New competitors entering the market or taking market share**: AMD is smashing it and Intel is stagnating.

**Risk in Numbers (a historical overview)**

By observing the yearly variation of its Free Cash Flow, we can extrapolate some statistics.

* Average variation of Free Cash Flow for the last 10y: **8.18%**
* Variance of the data set: **10.57%**
* Standard Deviation: **32.51%**

# Comments on the Valuation Methods used

|Method|Comment|
|:-|:-|
|**Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula**|Used in Value Investing taking in count EPS, growth rate and AAA bond yield. As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|
|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash & Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions. Some said that Cash & Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|
|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|
|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|
|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general ""discount rate"" loooool.|

# Conclusions

As i stated, **this is just a preliminary analysis**, *i still have to integrate some data, ratios and take in mind many other variables!*

Intel is surely lagging behind it competitors and falling in the ""***Too Big To Fail***"" mentality which makes them too complacent and lazy in doing things good. I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.

**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*

Many bulls are betting on a pivot toward the beginning of next year once a recession becomes evident. For two years it was constantly repeated to “not bet against the Fed” and now Bulls are doing exactly that. They have no clue if the Fed is going to back off at the end of this year, in fact Powell isn’t signaling he is going to at all. To me it appears they are just hoping they do. With the bond market holding at approximately 2.7%, the Fed only has to hike one more time and basically be done. I don’t foresee 2.7% to hold as further inflation readings come out. 

But let’s say he does pivot - how does that benefit the economy? There’s no way the rate hikes that have been implemented are doing enough damage to inflation to suggest that QE would be a good idea next year. If they lowered rates only a year after starting, that would just further lead to a stagflationary environment where consumers will continue to be priced out of everything - leading to another inevitable inflationary recession or the prolonging of the one we are entering. It would be a bandaid on  a much bigger wound that needs adequate medicine - a hardcore high unemployment recession. 

Without high unemployment inflation can not go down. It’s simply not possible. They need to push people out of work in order to conduct true demand destruction. We have started seeing hiring freezes and slight layoffs in certain companies, but nothing in terms of the magnitude to adequately conduct demand destruction. I firmly believe Powell won’t back off until he sees higher unemployment. He consistently repeats that the labor market is strong and is suggesting we aren’t going into a recession, so if that’s true how is that bullish? If anything he’s stating how strong things are and it gives him even more of a reason to hike. He reiterates the same thing over and over - we have a strong labor market. 

So to me we get two options: either a Fed that hikes into a recession and high unemployment and he meets his goal of demand destruction to tackle inflation or he pivots and further contributes to higher inflation and leads to a recession anyway. I am a bull long term, but the current times mimic the depression. The roaring 20s were due to QE after the war (this time COVID), unchecked speculative investing and inflation, and a behind the curve Fed that started tightening into a recession.  Earnings also haven’t been looking great, with big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta missing. Apple is up tomorrow as well and I anticipate a miss, especially after seeing Walmart’s atrocious miss. So genuinely curious (and not looking for hate, I am a bear short term but bull long term) - what is bullish?"

During an internal presentation, Meta execs laid out plans for three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‘neural interface’ smartwatch.

Meta plans to release its first pair of smart glasses with a display in 2025 alongside a neural interface smartwatch designed to control them, The Verge has learned. Meanwhile, its first pair of full-fledged AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has predicted will eventually be as widely used as mobile phones, is planned for 2027.

The details were shared with thousands of employees in Meta’s Reality Labs division on Tuesday during a roadmap presentation of its AR and VR efforts that was shared with The Verge. Altogether, they show how Meta is planning to keep investing in consumer hardware after a series of setbacks and broader cost cutting across the company. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment for this story.

With regards to the VR roadmap, employees were told that Meta’s flagship Quest 3 headset coming later this year will be two times thinner, at least twice as powerful, and cost slightly more than the $400 Quest 2. Like the recently announced Quest Pro, it will prominently feature mixed reality experiences that don’t fully immerse the wearer, thanks to front-facing cameras that pass through video of the real world. Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date, Mark Rabkin, the company’s vice president for VR, told employees during the presentation.

(I’ll have more from this meeting and my thoughts about Meta’s roadmap in Thursday’s issue of my newsletter Command Line.)

Three new Quest models


Meta’s main challenge with the Quest 3, which is internally codenamed Stinson, will be convincing people to pay “a bit more” money than the cost of the existing Quest 2, according to Rabkin. “We have to get enthusiasts fired up about it,” he told employees Tuesday. “We have to prove to people that all this power, all these new features are worth it.”

Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date

Mixed reality will be a huge selling point, and Rabkin said there will be a new “smart guardian” to help wearers navigate the real world while they are wearing the device. “The main north star for the team was from the moment you put on this headset, the mixed reality has to make it feel better, easier, more natural,” he said. “You can walk effortlessly through your house knowing you can see perfectly well. You can put anchors and things on your desktop. You can take your coffee. You can stay in there much longer.”

There will be 41 new apps and games shipping for the Quest 3, including new mixed reality experiences to take advantage of the updated hardware, Rabkin said. In 2024, he said that Meta plans to ship a more “accessible” headset codenamed Ventura. “The goal for this headset is very simple: pack the biggest punch we can at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.”

Rabkin didn’t say whether a second generation of the recent Meta Quest Pro, which received poor reviews from The Verge and others, is coming anytime soon. The closest to what sounds like a successor will be “way out in the future” after Ventura in 2024, when Meta is planning its most advanced headset codenamed La Jolla featuring photorealistic, codec avatars.

“We want to make it higher resolution for work use and really nail work, text and things like that,” Rabkin said about La Jolla. “We want to take a lot of the comfort things from Quest Pro and how it sits on your head and the split architecture and bring that in for comfort.”

Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged. “Right now, we’re on our third year of Quest 2,” he told employees. “And sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas, they’re just not as into it” or engaged as “the ones who bought it early.”

Rabkin pushed employees to make the sharing of VR content on other platforms “trivial,” redesign the Quest store to make it more “dynamic,” and give developers the ability to do things like automated promotions.

The current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged

“We need to be better at growth and retention and resurrection,” he said. “We need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more intuitive so people can count on it.” 

Even with these struggles, Meta has built an early lead in virtual reality hardware. But its big swings over the coming years speak to the serious competition that’s about to arrive. Apple is expected to announce a high-end virtual reality headset sometime this year, while Sony just released the well-received PSVR 2 for console gamers. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Snap, and others are all racing toward something even bigger: augmented reality glasses — and that’s where Meta is hoping its early efforts in the mixed reality space will really pay off.

AR glasses and neural interfaces

Aside from the Quest lineup, Meta also has thousands of employees building future AR glasses and wrist devices for controlling them. The key difference from VR is that the company intends for AR glasses to eventually be worn throughout the day as a replacement for smartphones. Zuckerberg has called them the “holy grail” device that will “redefine our relationship with technology” by the end of this decade.

During Tuesday’s roadmap presentation, Alex Himel, the company’s vice president for AR, laid out the plan for a bevy of devices through 2027. The first launch will come this fall with the second generation of Meta’s camera-equipped smart glasses it released in 2021 with Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.

In 2025, Himel said the third generation of the smart glasses will ship with a display that he called a “viewfinder” for viewing incoming text messages, scanning QR codes, and translating text from another language in real time. The glasses will come with a “neural interface” band that allows the wearer to control the glasses through hand movements, such as swiping fingers on an imaginary D-pad.  Eventually, he said the band will let the wearer use a virtual keyboard and type at the same words per minute as what mobile phones allow.

The smartwatch will integrate with Meta’s social media apps and offer health and fitness features

While Meta canned its plans for a smartwatch with a detachable display and cameras, it’s still working on another smartwatch to accompany its 2025 glasses, Himel confirmed.

“We don’t want people to have to choose between an input device on their wrist and smartwatch functionality that they’ve come to love,” he said. “So we are building a neural interfaces watch. Number one, this device will do input: input to control your glasses, input to control the functionality on your wrist, and input to control the world around you.”

Himel showed employees a demo of the glasses in which, during a video call, the cameras on the glasses were showing the wearer’s front-facing perspective at the same time as a selfie view was being shown from the camera on the watch. He said the smartwatch will be an optional upgrade from a paired-down neural band that comes with the glasses, and that it will also integrate with Meta’s social media apps like WhatsApp and offer health and fitness features.

Meta’s first true pair of AR glasses, which the company has been internally developing for 8 years under the codename Orion, are more technically advanced, expensive, and designed to project high-quality holograms of avatars onto the real world. There will be an “internal launch” for employees to test the glasses in 2024, according to Himel. A version won’t be released to the public until 2027, when Meta will launch what Himel called its “Innovation” line of AR glasses for early adopters alongside a “Scale” line of the less advanced smart glasses and the second generation of its neural smartwatch.

Himel framed the market opportunity around the almost two billion pairs of regular glasses and hundreds of millions of smartwatches that are sold each year. “If we can put on shelves a great product at a great price with the right value, we believe we can get into these upgrade cycles and have a lot of growth of our devices,” he told the room. “It’s on us to deliver.” 

“A business unlike anything we’ve seen on mobile phones before”

Meta is planning to rely on its existing business model of advertising to help it make money off these future devices. Himel said the company thinks it can make a higher average revenue per user than what it makes currently in social media, thanks to a combination of selling virtual goods, optional add-ons like cloud backups, and AR ads.

“We should be able to run a very good ads business,” he said. “I think it’s easy to imagine how ads would show up in space when you have AR glasses on. Our ability to track conversions, which is where there has been a lot of focus as a company, should also be close to 100 percent.”

“If we’re hitting anything near projections, it will be a tremendous business,” he said. “A business unlike anything we’ve seen on mobile phones before.”"
136,Is ChatGPT a threat to Google? Yahoo refusal to acquire Google give us some hints on what may be on the horizon.,66,109wccz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/109wccz/is_chatgpt_a_threat_to_google_yahoo_refusal_to/,209,1673518915.0,"Google is an interesting company. It has strong competitive advantage, is basically a monopoly on the search engine market, with the word ""Google"" that became a verb. Google is soo dominant in its position (Bing is a joke, Firefox is basically financed by Google), is the default search engine on both android, that they own, and ios. The search engine is the centre of Google's eco-system, (Drive, G-mail, Google account, to a smaller extent YouTUube), that make competing with them almost impossible. Even in a ""bad"" year like 2022, made over 60bln in net profits. Nothing to worry about right?

I think chatgpt can be a treat for Google's business model. It is developing very fast, is infinately scalable and is backed by Microsoft. Of course Google is working on it's AI technology, and I am sure what they developed is impressive, I have no doubt that they can become a juggernout in the chatbot/AI space.

However we should not confuse CAN with WILL. Embracing this technology would require Google to revolutionise its business model, and find new ways of monetizing its data. Back in the days, Yahoo lost everything for the same reason. They could have acquired Google, a new powerful search engine that delivers search results quickly (for only 1 mln dollars), but they decided to dismiss the better more efficinet solution, that they had no finacial incentive to adopt. They instead decided to make people spend more time on their website where they can be bombarded by ads. Sounds familiar, right?

Yahoo still exists, but is nothing like before. Google used to say, ""competition is always one click away"". Maybe they are right. What do you think, will they be the next Yahoo?"
137,"Chat GPT, Microsoft and AWS",71,10epgzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10epgzd/chat_gpt_microsoft_and_aws/,53,1673994044.0,"Been reading about how Microsoft is looking to add ChatGPT to its Azure cloud platform and make it available to customers that way. 

This seems like very smart poker from MSFT. 

And I think most people might be looking at the wrong competitor here (looking at Google rather than Amazon). Here’s why I think that. 

I think the battlefield here (for the moment) is cloud, not search. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the dominant cloud services provider, with Microsoft second (Azure) and Google third. AWS is responsible for the vast majority of Amazons profit, even though it only brings in a minority of its revenue.

But offering customers of Azure the ChatGPT functionality gives Microsoft a genuine unique selling point over its largest rival in cloud. And until Amazon plugs that capability hole it might be vulnerable to losing some very valuable market share to Azure.

Cloud is internet infrastructure worth billions currently, with plenty of runway left. This way of going to market with ChatGPT might give Microsoft a big edge in that market and give it time to figure out how to better integrate it with its other services while the cash rolls in.

139,Let's Talk About Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD),64,wo474r,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wo474r/lets_talk_about_warner_bros_discovery_wbd/,70,1660476547.0,"Note : English is not my first language, sorry if i can't articulate my point properly.

**Background**

Early this year AT&T spinoff their entertainment division, WarnerMedia to merge it with Discovery. The combined entity is now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

WBD started their first trading day, on April 11, 2022 closing at $24.78, but now the share price is at $13.78

**Why the stock dropping so much**

There are several reasons that might explain:

1)General market condition 

During April to July, we see a market correction across all indices, so WBD might be a victim of ""IPO"" at the wrong time.

Moreover, there seems to be general apathy toward media stocks as of right now that contributed to the price performance. You named it, from social media like Meta, Snap. Streaming co like Netflix, traditional media co like DIS, PARA, video game maker like TTWO, Ubisoft, RBLX.

2)AT&T shareholder don't want to have anything to do with WBD

Most AT&T shareholders are in it for the dividends, and yet WBD don't pay dividend and will likely to remain so in the few years as their priority is to reduce their leverage. So, it is likely that the stock tanked due to selling pressure from forced owner.

3)Management quality?

This is probably the major overhang. David Zaslav, the CEO seems like a capable and competent guy for the jobs, a long time veteran in media business. But unlike Disney, WarnerMedia on its own is a clusterfuck with no clear vision. Adding Discovery makes it even harder. Can Zaslav fixed it?

So far there are already questionable decisions like shutting off Batgirl when it is already finished, relaunching of new streaming services (when they have already invested billions growing HBO brand), DCEU problems, etc.

4)Very high leverage

Thanks in large part to AT&T, WBD is saddled with very high level of debt. Of the $142 billion of total assets, about $53 billion is funded by debt, and total liabilities of $89 billion. To put thing into perspective, the current market cap for WBD is $33 billion. So every profit that they make, mostly will go to debt holder, instead to shareholders (yes, this is oversimplification).

5)Last result is not encouraging

The consesus estimate EPS for Q2 2022 is $0.12, yet the company record an earning loss (EPS) of $1.5

**Why this trade might work?**

1)It is cheap

Yes, a terrible investment thesis, especially when they just recorded an earning loss. All the potential synergy might never realizes, making this investment a total value trap. But again, it is cheap as of right now, and for all we know, all the bad things have already been priced in, no?

2)They have a strong collection of IP

DC Universe, Wizarding World (Harry Potter), Every shit HBO made (Game of Thrones, and i dont know), CNN, Oprah Winfrey, etc. 

Also, this can possibly makes them for prime takeover target.

Netflix prove that you need strong IP to win long term in media business, something that they severely lacks. Amazon bought MGM last years. It is no secret that big tech, whether it is Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and even Meta has lofty ambition in media industry.

3)Seems to be a favorite amongs superinvestor?

Michael Burry, David Einhorn, Seth Klarman loads up the position during Q2 2022. Buffett, bought shares in PARA, but i believe there are not much differences in business thesis between WBD and PARA.

4)Industry Tailwind

Both Disney and Netflix are planning to raise prices, signalling the priority for profits amongs media business. Cinema is making a comeback, midterm election means increasing ad spent for both parties, etc. 

An industry going back to its roots should be perfect time for David Zaslav to shine.

**What do you think?**

Personally, i have small position in the stocks. I see this as special situations where heavy selling pressure exist due to AT&T shareholders selling their stake instead of business performance issue.

While high debt level is cause of some concern, they manage to lock the interest rate between 3%-5%.

Overall still manageable. Earning loss probably related to M&A, and in due time should normalize to profitability.

What do you think? Please share what you though."

[DD],55,12hevdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12hevdn/a_deep_dive_on_paypal_is_it_a_good_time_to_buy_dd/,75,1681123404.0,"A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?

# Operations

First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased. 

* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts added  
Out of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts
* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion
* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.

The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.

When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.

***US market***  
In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.

***Worldwide***  
In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps. 

***Total Payment Volume competition***  
Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.

# Financials metrics

We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?

To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.

Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:

* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%
* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%
* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%
* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%

Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.

# Analyst Expectations

Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:

* 18.33% in 2023
* 15.28% in 2024
* 13.07% in 2025

In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.

Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.

# Valuation

This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:

* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.
* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94
* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2
* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1
* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4

The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.

One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.

The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.

The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.

# Conclusion

Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.

What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?"
148,Softbank files for ARM IPO. Looking to raise $8-10b. I'm not buying.,50,134m54h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/134m54h/softbank_files_for_arm_ipo_looking_to_raise_810b/,17,1682946728.0,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks\_arm\_to\_ipo\_buyers\_beware/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first:**

>ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  
Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  
Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  
Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM.  
ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business.

I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.

Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more.

In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft.

ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent.

This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is [ditching stock ARM cores](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16684/ampere-roadmap-full-custom-cores) for their own custom server cores.

Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs.

Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am [one of the few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/s1r0w8/nvidia_was_approached_by_softbank_to_buy_arm_not/hsb30a6/?context=3) on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real.

Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.

ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow.

There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company that valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The job and cost cutting come after a decade of heavy spending in a focus on top-line growth © FT montage/Bloomberg
Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft will collectively incur more than $10bn in charges related to mass redundancies, real estate and other cost-saving measures, as the Big Tech companies reveal the hefty price they incur to rein in spending.

The US companies that have been implementing the largest job cuts in the tech sector disclosed the high costs related to their restructuring efforts in earnings statements released this week.

The four groups had previously announced 50,000 job cuts to convince Wall Street they were heading into a “year of efficiency”, as Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg described it. This trend comes after more than a decade of heavy spending in a focus on aggressive top-line growth.

Despite the companies’ high upfront costs such as severance payments, investors appear encouraged by the steps taken.

Since formally announcing their cuts, the companies have together added more than $800bn to their market capitalisations. Meta, the earliest mover among the Big Tech groups, has seen its value almost double since detailing its job cuts in November.

While savings could have been made by implementing more gradual cost reductions, tech companies were being rewarded by the markets for “ripping the band aid off”, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

“Big Tech has been spending money like 80s rock stars for the last four to five years,” he said. “It feels like there’s adults in the room now.”

The process to become leaner in the wake of macroeconomic pressure contrasts starkly with the pandemic-era hiring boom, with headcounts increasing rapidly at tech companies that were responding to a rise in demand in digital products and services.

Apple remains the only large tech company that has not announced any job cuts or a cost-cutting programme, despite on Thursday reporting its first decline in quarterly revenues in three and a half years.

According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker logging instances of tech redundancies, almost 250,000 employees have been let go across the sector since the start of last year.

Some of the most recent, from this past week, include software group Okta, which laid off 300 employees, data analysis company Splunk, with 325, and image-sharing social network Pinterest, which said 150 roles would go.

The deepest cuts have come from the biggest names. In November, Meta announced it would let go 11,000 of its employees, as well as dump office space and data centres.

On Wednesday, the Facebook parent detailed charges of $4.6bn related to restructuring. Severance costs ran to $975mn, according to a company filing, though that cost was offset by “decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses”. A further $1bn in charges related to reducing office footprint is expected in 2023.

Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy told employees in January the company would eliminate 18,000 roles.

Speaking to investors on Thursday, Amazon’s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said $640mn had been spent on severance in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as an additional $720mn on abandoning real estate, primarily due to pulling back on opening new physical grocery stores. The company did not share further details on charges it might incur in the current quarter and beyond.

Google parent Alphabet, which is laying off 12,000 people, said it expected to incur severance costs ranging from $1.9bn to $2.3bn, with most of the impact in the current quarter. At the high end of that guidance, the cost of severance will work out at approximately $191,000 per employee. Alphabet faces a further $500mn in costs relating to office space reduction in the current quarter, it said.

Despite the cuts, Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat told investors on Thursday the company would continue “hiring in priority areas, with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent, as well as on the global footprint of our talent”.

Microsoft’s planned savings — which include 10,000 job cuts — has resulted in it incurring a $1.2bn charge in the final three months of 2022, $800mn of which was from severance pay.

Salesforce, which will not report earnings until March, is expected to be another company facing significant restructuring costs, having announced a 10 per cent reduction in its workforce last month. That move came as activist investor Elliott Management took a multibillion-dollar stake in the company, saying it intended to work “constructively with Salesforce to realise the value befitting a company of its stature”. 

Likewise, Alphabet has drawn attention from activist Sir Christopher Hohn, of TCI Fund Management, who wrote to chief executive Sundar Pichai, saying he needed to make further headcount cuts and trim “excessive employee compensation”."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

162,Irritated Google CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by employees over cuts to travel and entertainment budgets. Good sign for shareholders?,46,xn11r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xn11r0/irritated_google_ceo_sundar_pichai_was_grilled_by/,42,1664045996.0,"Seems Googlers don't understand why travel and entertainment budgets/perks are getting scrutinized and cut. Markets undergoing a meltdown is irrelevant apparently.  From a shareholder perspective, this is a good sign from Pichai that he's not afraid to have these difficiult conversations with his staffers.  Surely Google is not the only tech company being cost conscious, given the volatility and uncertainty in the markets.  

&#x200B;

**Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly grew agitated during a “heated” all-hands meeting in which an employee asked why the search engine was “nickel-and-diming” workers by taking away perks and benefits.**

Pichai, who has ratcheted up the pressure on Googlers to **boost productivity in the midst of a sharp economic downturn**, held court at a meeting in New York this week during which **he was** **grilled by his employees over cuts to travel and entertainment budgets.**

**One worker summoned the nerve to ask Pichai why Google was “nickel-and-diming employees” when the company reported “record profits and huge cash reserves,”** according to audio obtained by CNBC.

**The Googler’s pointed question was met with a positive response by his colleagues**, who **rated it high on the company’s internal Dory Q&A system**, according to CNBC.

Pichai reportedly paused to gather his thoughts and offer a measured response.

“How do I say it?” the CEO is reported to have told the disgruntled employee.

**“Look, I hope all of you are reading the news, externally,” Pichai continued. “The fact that you know, we are being a bit more responsible through one of the toughest macroeconomic conditions underway in the past decade, I think it’s important that as a company, we pull together to get through moments like this.”**

Pichai is said to have sounded annoyed, telling his charges: **“We don’t get to choose the macroeconomic conditions always.” He added that it was important for the company “to be smart, to be frugal, to be scrappy, to be more efficient.”**

**“I remember when Google was small and scrappy,”** Pichai said.

**“Fun didn’t always — we shouldn’t always equate fun with money. I think you can walk into a hard-working startup and people may be having fun and it shouldn’t always equate to money.”** 

**One employee commented on Dory that it was ironic for Pichai to be slashing travel expenses while at the same time flying out to New York from his Bay Area headquarters to meet with them.**

**“It’s an interesting choice for Sundar to be in New York…after travel for employees is cut to only the most business critical,” the employee reportedly wrote on Dory.**

“I’m sure Sundar has business-critical meetings in New York.”

Pichai responded: “I think so. I think it qualified.” The response drew laughter from the audience, according to CNBC.

The CEO, who hinted at layoffs after the company imposed a hiring freeze earlier this summer, also **pushed back against an employee’s suggestion that Google shifted to a strategy of ""aggressive cost saving"".**

**“I’m a bit concerned that you think what we’ve done is what you would define as aggressive cost saving,” Pichai said. “I think it’s important we don’t get disconnected. You need to take a long-term view through conditions like this.”**

Pichai, who dodged a question about executive pay at Google, said that the firm was **“still investing in long-term projects like quantum computing.”**

Pichai earned $6.3 million in salary last year.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that **Google informed some employees that they needed to apply for new jobs within the company if they hoped to remain employed**.

**Those who failed to reapply within 90 days would be let go**, The Journal reported.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported that its payroll had 174,014 employees as of the end of the second quarter.

In July, Alphabet reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue. The company anticipates that its third-quarter sales growth will fall into the single digits — a far cry from the more than 40% figure from a year prior.

Shares of Alphabet fell 1.4% Friday.

The Post has sought comment from the company.

An Alphabet spokesperson told CNBC: **“Sundar has been speaking to the company consistently over the last few months about ways we can be more focused.”**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

170,Unpopular opinion: oil prices will stay high until oil stocks go up,44,ykus4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ykus4r/unpopular_opinion_oil_prices_will_stay_high_until/,61,1667458723.0,"In a normal commodity cycle, the cure for high prices is high prices. However, that is no longer the case, and I will explain why I think that is the case. I will try to list sources where I can but a lot of this information has been synthesized over time and therefore you will just have to google some things. Even the sources I find will be articles I find on google to support my statements.

High prices do not necessarily create permanent demand destruction. Even in the worst parts of the 2008 recession, oil demand barely dropped. Not to mention that demand can recover and if the fed pivots, it can be quite inflationary at least for commodity prices where physical markets are tight.

Here is an article of which I only want to highlight a single sentence (but I figure I should include a source). 

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/oil-demand-price-coronavirus-world-bank/

“In 2008, the Great Recession led to demand falling by 0.66%”

That is nothing! But supply had already grown too much from the shale boom, leading to a supply/demand balance that favored the buyer. Compared to today, however, as the bottom half of the world is lifted out of poverty, they will consume more oil. They will go from bikes to motorcycles and motorcycles to cars. Let’s be real: they aren’t getting EVs anytime soon.

Furthermore,  as europe heads into an energy crisis and Russian gas is no longer an option due to nordstream explosions (only one pipeline left but it’s way smaller capacity than before), they will need to burn more oil and coal. This could lead to a lot of gas to oil switching https://bisoninterests.com/content/f/gas-to-oil-switching-–-winter-is-coming

I DONT WANT to hear any poorly framed arguments about european storage being full or TTF going negative. It doesn’t matter. Here is why anyone that tells you that europe will be fine with their storage doesn’t know what they are talking about: If you are driving cross country and start with a full tank that can get you 20% of the way there (being generous here), does that mean you can automatically make it coast to coast? No. You have to gas up. Likewise, getting through winter is the same. Gas storage cannot account for the entire winter. They need constant inflows. Heating oil, diesel and coal are just LNG without the infrastructure and therefore Europe will go for those next.

That being said, demand is ultimately very difficult to pin down. What I would like to focus on is supply.

Biden often complains about oil companies doing buybacks and dividends. Why? Because at these prices, dividends and buybacks get shareholders better return than growth at these multiples. Why are multiples low? Because institutions have shunned fossil fuel companies too long and Yellen and Granholm have also told development banks to tighten lending conditions to oil companies. 

Divestment examples:

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-new-york-pension-fund-divest-half-its-shale-companies-2022-02-09/

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-swf-oil/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-to-divest-oil-explorers-keep-refiners-idUSKBN1WG4R9

https://www.npr.org/2021/09/10/1035901596/harvard-university-end-investment-fossil-fuel-industry-climate-change-activism

Yellen and fossil fuel lending:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/yellen-targets-curbs-on-development-bank-support-for-fossil-fuel#xj4y7vzkg


Besides that, analysts will say “shareholders want buybacks and dividends over growth.” It’s becoming a tired phrase. Who are shareholders here? Greedy people like me who want gains and don’t want to have them produce more without me making any more money, and etf and fund managers like blackrock and vanguard who only are custodians of the shares but get all the voting power. Guess what? Not only are they greedy too, but they also want to choke oil. Consequently, the sector globally is in liquidation. According to Rick Rule (who I trust a lot), the oil industry is $1b/day underinvested in sustaining current output. Furthermore, if, for example, Brent is at $110 and oil stocks price in $60, am I going to want to risk oversupply? No! Because I would be terrified about what share price would do if it priced in $60 at $110 and then the price actually dropped down to $60. What would it price in then? $20 at $60? $10? Negative?

OPEC also cannot ramp up production anytime soon. And why would they? 

https://time.com/6219783/opec-large-production-cut/

They want $90+ oil

https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-biden-that-uea-saudi-can-barely-raise-oil-output-2022-06-27/

They can’t. Only Russia could have, but they needed western OFS, which all left the country, so their production will actually fall. 

We must rely on western oil companies.

Unpopular take: oil prices will remain heightened and volatile and spikes will persist until oil stocks go up. The cure to high prices is no longer high prices. It’s high oil stock prices. They are stupid cheap, and until they trade at reasonable multiples, shareholders and etf managers like blackrock and vanguard will not let them do anything but dividends and buybacks.  And that is great for CEOs and boards. No need to make hard choices. No need to take risks. Just say those two magic words, so of course they will choose the easy way.

tl;dr
Shareholders will only allow significant new production when stocks go up. Till then, buybacks and dividends.
If they are not making gains somehow, what the hell are they holding high torque cyclical stocks for? So stop throwing money into the bottomless hole that is tech. XOM just hit ATH. you will never make as much money as the guy you heard about it from, but there is room to run. If you are afraid of being late, late cycle OFS hasn’t outperformed yet. It’s a bull market.


edit: Regarding XOM being at ATH: No cause of concern yet. there are small caps cash flowing their market cap out there. I would buy those. But as for XOM, XOM/SPX chart shows we have a long way to go till overvaluation https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=XOM%2FSPX

ATH tells you one thing. inflation adjusted high says another. reinclusion into SPX will tell you another (people will frontrun that). Ratio chart is the most useful imo. For XOM/SPX and also XOP/oil ratio. I learned to look at those from a guy on youtube who runs a neat channel called “finding value finance”. great follow for all things commodities"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If you want a shorter version, here is a nice [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-amazon-meta-highlight-tech-heavy-earnings-week-11658568602?mod=hp_lead_pos5). They note:

> A little more than one-third of S&P 500, or 175 companies, are scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, according to FactSet. [...]

> So far, around 20% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings for their recently ended quarter, according to FactSet. Results have been mostly underwhelming, with the number of companies reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those surprises trending below their five-year average. Overall, earnings are on track to rise 4.8% this period, which would mark the slowest rate since the end of 2020, and revenue for the period is on track to grow 10.9%, FactSet said.

Hey Everyone,
First time posting on here. Me and my fiancé are working on reallocating our money in our retirement fund to reduce some risk to the downside over the coming year. Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.

20% S&P index fund,
XLK - 5%,
XLI - 5%,
XLP - 20.25%,
XLU - 10%,
XLB - 2.5%,
XLV - 18%,
XLC - 5%,
XLE - 5.5%,
5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.

Essentially we’re leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.

Remaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.

Edit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into ANY companies we like for the long run. Those are just the ones we thought of off the top of our heads. Open to suggestions here, they don’t have to be tech companies."
186,"The million-dollar question: ""Gloomy bonds vs optimistic stocks"", column by dutch economist Corne van Zeijl",38,126mo7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/126mo7g/the_milliondollar_question_gloomy_bonds_vs/,8,1680182227.0,"*I'm posting this because I was thinking the same before I read this. It's google translated, but it holds up well:*

Corne van Zeijl

**Gloomy bonds vs optimistic stocks**

Bond investors often see the future somewhat gloomy. If you are very optimistic about the future, you invest in stocks. At least there's a big upside in that. With bonds you receive a modest interest payment if things go well, but if things go wrong you lose your money. Just ask Credit Suisse subordinated bondholders. When I see what expectations are priced into the bond market, the gloom is dripping off. In the United States, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates sharply in the course of the year. Before the banking crisis, a Fed interest rate of 5.5% was still assumed at the first meeting of 2024. Now only 4.2%.

That is a special scenario. It doesn't seem logical. The Fed itself also assumes that interest rates will remain high for the time being. A longer period of time in which the Fed holds the pause button is more realistic. The Fed will first want to see how inflation develops. Of course inflation is going down. But the question is how fast? There are plenty of second-order effects, or derivative effects. In the Netherlands we have the example of healthcare workers. They just gained 15%. I wish everyone a big salary increase. But who's going to pay for it? The premium for health insurance will therefore rise and that will drive inflation. So everyone wants more salary again. And so on, and so on.

It is of course possible that the gloomy bond investors will be proven right. But that requires a dark scenario. For example, a scenario in which the fear of even more failing banks continues. Then the Fed could help by cutting interest rates. Or a scenario in which the economy goes down hard. In that case, the Fed need not be so afraid of high inflation and the arrows will be aimed at saving the economy. Keep in mind that the Fed mainly looks at employment. And it's still excellent.

Equity investors, meanwhile, are only seeing the positive side of this lower interest rate. The negative consequences of the banking crisis are carelessly brushed aside. In 2008, the world stock index halved. In the current banking crisis, there was a short correction of only 5%. Analysts already see a strong recovery in profits at the end of 2023. While the economy will suffer considerably from the decline in lending. And wages will also eat up a large chunk of the profit pie.

It seems that equity investors only want to see the bright side, while bond investors only see dark clouds on the horizon. But only one of the two is going to be right. And if the truth is somewhere in the middle, they will both be disappointed.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# **S&P 500 ends Thursday higher, but suffers its first down week in four: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
> Tech stocks lifted the S&P 500 into the green Thursday as the market wrapped up the short trading week on a high note despite signs of a weakening labor market.
*****
> The S&P 500 rose 0.36% to 4,105.02 after losing as much as 0.50% earlier. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a 0.76% gain to 12,087.96, boosted by a 3.78% rise in Google-parent Alphabet and a 2.55% rally in Microsoft shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 2.57 points higher to 33,485.29 after losing more than 150 points at its session low.
*****
> The S&P 500 still lost 0.1% on the week, posting its first losing week in four. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.1% this week, while the 30-stock Dow rose 0.6%.
*****
> The market remained volatile as the latest weekly jobless claims came in higher than expected, adding to recent signals that pointed to slowing job growth. The expansion in private payrolls was well below expectations in March, ADP said earlier this week. Meanwhile, the number of available positions fell below 10 million in February — a first in almost two years. Job cuts have also soared by nearly fivefold so far this year from a year ago.
*****
> Over the past several months, investors had cheered signs of economic cooling on the hope that it could push the Federal Reserve to change course on its interest rate hiking campaign. But they are now wondering if the central bank has gone too far in its bid to cool inflation, tightening the economy to the point of a recession.
*****
> “The Fed built a wall with interest rates and now the economy is running into it,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
*****
> Thursday capped off a shortened trading week with the market closed for Good Friday. Investors will still closely monitor March jobs report Friday morning. Nonfarm payrolls have been showing solid growth despite layoffs across tech and financial sectors, but many believe the trend is poised to reverse soon.
*****
> Jobless claims data “lends credence to the idea that the Fed’s rate hikes are beginning to cool down the labor market and slow down the economy,” said Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Independent Advisor Alliance. “The odds are much higher that it will cause a recession – and even a significant recession – than most people are currently willing to believe.”

> # A Big Win for the Bulls

> “We may not know where we are going, but we better know where we stand.” Howard Marks, Co-Founder of Oaktree Capital Management

> A little-known technical indicator triggered in the first quarter, and it could bring smiles to the bulls. This one is known as the December Low indicator, and it is fairly straightforward: when the S&P 500 doesn’t close beneath the December low close, good things have tended to happen the rest of the year. The opposite, of course, is when the December lows are violated in the first quarter. To refresh your memory, that is exactly what happened last year and was one subtle clue that the odds of a dicey rest of ’22 had increased. Given that stocks didn’t break their December low this year, this is one less worry for sure.

> Interestingly, since 1950, stocks held above the December lows 36 times while they broke the lows 37 times. Talk about even Steven. Those are some pretty big sample sizes, and sure enough, the results are quite conclusive.

> Those 36 times the December lows held? The full year was up an incredible 34 times and up an average of 18.6%. The times it failed? The full year was down 0.2% on average and higher less than a coin flip.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-170.png))**

> If you wanted to investigate things closer, here are all 36 times it held above the December lows. I added what happened the rest of the year (so the next three quarters) as well, and once again, strong performance was quite normal. We get it. Anything could happen from here, but the truth is it would be quite abnormal to expect a massive bear market and a horrible year for stocks this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-216.png))**

> Here’s the other side to things; what happened when the December low was violated? Once again, the full year and the next three quarters’ returns were much different and weaker. Just a quick glance and some of the worst years ever saw the December lows broken. Years like ’73, ’74, the tech bubble, ’08, and ’22 all made this infamous list.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-32.png))**

> Odds are, as you read this, I will be on a beach in the Turks and Caicos for Spring Break. (You caught me, I wrote this last week.) So as of right now, I’m not overly concerned about this potentially bullish development; I’m more into those fruity drinks with umbrellas in them, but once I get back home, you better believe this will be one that I’ll be focusing on closely. Or, as Howard Marks said in the quote above, we don’t know where we are going, but we do know we stand on potentially a better backdrop for stocks than most think.

> # What Would Moses Do? Sell Passover

> If Moses were trading stocks in the 21st Century, he would be wise to the seasonal cycles that move the markets year after year and know that Passover is the time to begin considering some portfolio spring cleaning.

> The full Hebrew calendar trading strategy is “Sell Rosh Hashanah-Buy Yom Kippur-Sell Passover.” Passover conveniently occurs in March or April, right near the end of our “Best Six Months” strategy and it’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and opportune months.

> DJIA is up 81.8% of the time from Yom Kippur to Passover since 1990 with an average gain of 8.1%.On the flipside DJIA is up 62.5% from Passover to Yom Kippur with an average gain of only 1.2% (not shown). DJIA is up 10.3% since Yom Kippur 2022 as of today’s close.

> # Claims Get Revised

> Jobless claims were in focus this morning as seasonally adjusted initial claims were surprisingly high at 228K versus expectations of 200K. Previously, adjusted claims had consistently come in well below 200K with 10 readings below that level in the last 11 weeks. However, that large increase in the most recent week's data was matched with large revisions to the past couple of years' data as the BLS updated its seasonal adjustment methodology. The net impact of those changes was to redistribute claims throughout the year, revising up readings from Q1 and Q4 while Q2 and Q3 were revised down; total or average annual readings were not changed. As discussed in greater detail on the BLS website and we will review in more depth in tonight's Closer, there are two methods for seasonal adjustment: multiplicative or additive. Most of the time the claims data has used multiplicative seasonal factoring, but periods like the first year of the pandemic in which the indicator experiences unusually large level increases means an additive approach becomes more apt. This week, the BLS applied a new hybrid approach with additive factoring applied from early March 2020 through mid-2021 and multiplicative factoring for all other periods.

> As shown below, that change back to multiplicative factoring resulted in some large revisions for initial claims over the past couple of years. In turn, that has dramatically changed the picture jobless claims have painted. Previously (red line in chart below) claims had been more or less trending sideways after bottoming around a year ago, but after these revisions (blue line) claims are trending upwards and bottomed this past September. In addition, the upward revision to 247K to the print from two weeks ago would mark the highest level since January 2022.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-1a.png))**

> As for the non-seasonally adjusted data, the story is much less noisy being unaffected by the aforementioned revisions. In other words, the overall picture for claims hasn't changed when looking at this series. Claims remain near historically healthy levels consistent with the few years prior to the pandemic. Granted, those are off the strongest readings from last year. At this point of the year, claims are also trending lower as could be expected based on seasonal patterns. The next couple of weeks may see claims move higher because of seasonality, though, that would likely prove to be a temporary bump in the road with claims resuming the trend lower through the late spring.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-Claims-2.png))**

> The revision likewise impacted continuing claims which rose to 1.823 million in the most recent week. That brings claims back up to the highest levels since December 2021 as they have risen sequentially for three weeks in a row.

> # Sentiment Back to Bullish

> Sentiment saw a huge rebound this week based on the latest AAII survey. With the S&P 500 taking out early March highs late last week, bullish sentiment jumped 10.8 percentage points to 33.3%. Although there was a higher level of bullish sentiment as recently as February 16th, this week's increase was the largest WoW jump since June of last year. Even though a double-digit jump in bullish sentiment sounds significant, S&P 500 performance has been unremarkable following similar instances historically.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-1.png))**

> The rise in bullish sentiment borrowed almost entirely from those reporting as bearish. Bearish sentiment fell 10.6 percentage points down to 35%. That is the lowest reading since mid-February and the first double-digit drop since November.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-2.png))**

> The huge shift in favor of bulls this week resulted in the bull-bear spread narrowing to -1.7 points. That is the least negative reading in the spread since February when the bull-bear spread had broken a record streak of bearish readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/040623-AAII-3.png))**

> As we noted last week, the AAII survey has been a holdout in showing more optimistic sentiment readings. Whereas other sentiment surveys like the NAAIM exposure index and the Investors Intelligence survey had essentially returned to historical averages, the AAII survey saw firmly bearish sentiment readings with a bull-bear spread of 1.6 standard deviations from its historical average as of last week. Given the quick turnaround this week, the AAII survey is no longer weighing on our Sentiment Composite as it moved back into positive territory indicating bullish sentiment for only the fourth week since the start of 2022.

> Let’s not forget about the looming debt ceiling crisis. It is the same political set up as pre-election year 2011: Democratic President with a split Congress composed of a Democratic Senate majority and a Republican House majority.

> The banking crisis may have been averted, at least for the time being. War in Ukraine drags on, but it still appears more like a protracted Cold War 2.0 scenario that the market has shrugged off. The earnings trough may indeed be ending. But! Let’s be devil’s advocates here.

> The standoff in 2011 between the White House and House Republicans is eerily similar to what’s developing in 2023. Markets topped out on the last trading day of April 2011 and entered a mini-bear phase with S&P down 19.4% on a closing basis before bottoming on October 3.

> 2011’s Worst Six Months were negative with the Dow down 6.7% and S&P down 8.1%. NASDAQ’s Worst 4 Months July-October were down 3.2%. S&P finished the year essentially flat at -0.003%, Dow was up 5.5%, NASDAQ was off 1.8% on the year.

> Uncertainty & headwinds can take a bite out of usual pre-election year gains. Heeding our Best 6 Months MACD Sell Signal when it triggers will likely be the prudent course of action. Review your portfolio. Get prepared to lock in these BSM gains, sell losers & tighten stops.

> # 3 Reasons the Dollar Isn’t Going Away Anytime Soon

> There’s always been talk about the U.S. dollar (USD) losing its dominant currency status globally, but lately, the chatter seems to have increased, especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which saw the US impose severe and expansive sanctions on Russia and Russian officials – enabled by the fact that the US treasury has jurisdiction over any transaction that involves the flow of USD. Rising tensions between the US and countries like China and Saudi Arabia have also raised concerns that these countries could price oil sales in Chinese yuan, denting the USD’s dominance in the global oil trade. Never mind the fact that these talks have been going on for several years now.

> The reality is this: the USD’s dominant role is not going to end any time soon, especially since there’s no good alternative. Let’s walk through 3 reasons why, using some great data from a recent Federal Reserve report.

> # 1. The World has confidence in the US, and thereby the U.S. dollar
> This confidence doesn’t come out of nowhere. As the Fed report notes, a key function of a currency is:

> *“A store of value which can be saved and retrieved in the future without significant loss of purchasing power.”*

> The US has the world’s deepest and most liquid financial markets thanks to the following:

> * The size of the US economy

> * The strength of the US economy

> * Open trade and capital flows, with fewer restrictions than a lot of other countries

> * Strong rule of law, and property rights, with a history of enforcing them

> This is why, despite the US making up just about 25% of the world economy, about 60% of global foreign currency reserves are denominated in USD. This has fallen from about 71% in 2000 but is still far ahead of other currencies, including the euro (21%), yen (6%), British pound (5%), and Chinese renminbi (2%). And the decline has been taken by various other currencies, as opposed to a single other one.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-foreign-exchange-reserves-1202x1600.png))**

> # 2. Network effects: The USD is dominant in trade invoicing and international finance
> The USD is the world’s most popular medium of exchange when it comes to trade, even beyond North & South America. Outside of Europe, where the euro is naturally dominant, more than 70% of exports are invoiced in US dollars. That’s not likely to change anytime soon, especially with so many countries and companies involved.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-export-invoicing-1201x1600.png))**

> It shouldn’t be a surprise that the popularity of the USD as a medium of exchange means it almost automatically becomes the dominant currency in international banking. Think of all the USD flowing across global banks as companies/customers make payments to each other. 60% of international foreign currency banking claims, i.e., bank deposits denoted in foreign currency, and loans are USD. That’s been fairly stable since 2000 and has increased over the last few years. The euro is second but makes up just about 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-share-of-international-banking-1202x1600.png))**

> Network effects can be extremely hard to dislodge. It won’t be easy to convince people across the world that they have to move their assets from the US dollar to another currency, let alone make the switch without any risk.

> # 3. Most important reason is: The US is willing to maintain massive trade deficits
> Here are a couple of statistics (as of Q4 2022)

> * The rest of the world held about $7.4 trillion in US treasury securities

> * The rest of the world held about $1 trillion in USD banknotes, which is about 46% of all USD banknotes out there

> These are all “liabilities” of the US government, i.e., loans to the US government. But the real question is, why do foreigners hold so much of these in the first place?

> Part of the answer lies in the first two reasons, but here’s another big one. Foreigners sell a lot of stuff to Americans, about $3.3 trillion worth in 2022 alone. And they got USD in return for all that.

> In an ideal world, foreigners would turn around and use those dollars to purchase stuff made in the USA, and trade would be “balanced”.

> But they don’t. Instead, they bought about $2.1 trillion worth of goods from the US last year.

> *Which means there was an extra $1.2 trillion that foreigners had. What do they do with it?*

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-05-USD-trade-deficit-revised-1202x1600.png))**

> # The US is willing to supply the rest of the world with treasuries & banknotes

> U.S. dollars can only buy goods and financial assets in the US. Foreigners could buy something in Europe or China, but they’d have to convert the USD to euros/yuan first, and then someone else is left holding USD, and then they have to figure out what to do with those USD.

> Instead, foreigners turn around and buy the safest, most liquid security in the world: US treasuries. Some of them also simply hold USD in cash (or deposits in their local bank). As I noted above, these are liabilities of the US government that the US is more than willing to issue. No other country, including the Eurozone, looks remotely capable or willing to do that anytime soon.

> Which is why there are so many dollars and treasuries held by the rest of the world.

> Could that change as countries decide to trade in their own currencies instead of the USD? Sure, but there’s a problem.

> Take Saudi Arabia and China, for example. The former could sell oil to China in yuan, but then the Saudis have to figure out what to do with those yuan. They’d have to buy assets in China – but there aren’t too many of that, especially Chinese government bonds.

> China has capital controls as well. which means it may not be easy for the Saudis to pull their money out of China in the future, especially during a crisis when the Chinese want to limit outflows. Capital controls are how the Chinese control their currency, and it’s hard to see them letting go of that lever anytime soon.

> In sharp contrast, the Fed is willing to act as the global central bank, supplying dollar liquidity to the rest of the world when there’s a crisis.

> # The global economic model is unlikely to shift
> The Chinese could decide they don’t want extra dollars. So instead of selling all the extra stuff they produce to Americans, they could sell it to Europe, the rest of Asia, and Africa. But the thing is, those countries don’t want too many of those goods either – because consumption is not as big a part of their economies (like the US).

> Now, the Chinese could decide not to produce as much, but that is not a recipe for economic success.

> Ideally, their own citizens would buy all the extra stuff they produce. But here’s the problem: Chinese households don’t earn enough to buy all those extra goods, and they save a lot more than Americans. They have to since there’s nothing like Social Security or Medicare there. China then channels these savings into investment, which leads to a lot of buildings, infrastructure, and industrial production, which is what drives their economy.

> The Chinese government could “fix this,” but that involves a significant shift in how their economy works – essentially redistributing national income away from the government and businesses to households. A massive political project that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon.

> It’s not just the Chinese. It’s the Germans, too, along with countries like Taiwan and South Korea, all of whom are reliant on exports to drive their economies.

> A shift away from the economic model that these countries are reliant on to a model that is consumption-led is very difficult. As the previous chart shows, its actually gotten worse over the last few years as US trade deficits grew even more.

> In fact, it would be better for US manufacturers if other countries do switch their economic model. Because that would mean they could buy more stuff that’s made in the US. And trade would be more balanced.

> In any case, there’s no practical alternative to the U.S. dollar right now, and its dominance is likely to remain in place.

196,Lessons From Trading Risky Volatile Sticks,36,zlht7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlht7i/lessons_from_trading_risky_volatile_sticks/,22,1670993331.0,"Hey everyone, I've spent several years trading volatile risky stocks and I've learned a few lessons along the way. I would like to share them here in case they may be useful to you.

Now before I begin, I want to make it clear that I'm not promoting any particular stock. Nor do I encourage anyone to trade risky volatile stocks. Your best bet is to consistently invest in a total market index fund like VTI and forget about it. If you must invest in individual stocks, invest in safe blue chip stocks like Apple or Amazon.

If you do invest in risky volatile stocks, realize that you can very well lose all your money. This isn't a joke or a game. Take it seriously. I'm sharing what I learned so you can hopefully minimize your risks and maximize your gains.

I don't own any BBBY shares now but I did own many of them earlier this year. In fact, I invested my entire life savings into BBBY shares. I bought at the right time, in late July-early August 2022. I ended up buying around 5000 BBBY shares and my total cost basis was $45,000. This represented my entire life savings as I don't have a 401k or IRA account. So you can imagine that I took on a fair amount of risk by investing my entire life savings in 1 stock. I did it because I wanted to swing trade and make a lot of money.

Now as you may be aware, BBBY share price went up by a lot in August 2022. On August 17th, my 5000 BBBY shares were worth $150,000. Yes, that's right. I had made $105,000 in unrealized gains. Unfortunately, like a greedy fool, I didn't sell. I wanted that $150,000 to reach $500,000 before I sold my BBBY shares. Yes, I was greedy and foolish and paid the price.

This brings me to my first lesson:

**Always take profit when you're in the green.**

You will never be able to time the top so don't even try. Remember, it's better to take some profit then to take none. If your unrealized gains is good enough for you to want to take a screenshot and send to your friends and family, then it's good enough for you to sell and realize those gains. Never forget that. Always sell when you're in the green. Don't be greedy and try to time the top so you can maximize gains.

My second lesson is:

**When you're in the green, at least sell enough shares so that you've covered your cost basis. That way, you're left playing with house money.**

This is a huge one. Cover your cost basis. If I had sold enough BBBY shares to cover my 45k cost basis, I would be in a much better financial situation now. Instead, I was greedy and decided to keep holding so I could make more gains. The best part of doing this is the relief you feel after your cost basis is covered. You know then that you're just playing with house money and even if you lose everything, it's ok because it's house money, not your initial money invested.

Like a naive greedy fool, I held on to my BBBY shares as the share price went down. I could have sold for a huge profit but I decided to keep holding. However, to my credit, I did sell all 5000 of my BBBY shares on Friday, September 2nd 2022 for $8.50 a share. In hindsight, that was a great decision because the BBBY share price kept slowly going down since then and the share price ended under $3 today, Tuesday, December 13th 2022. If I had kept holding those shares and not sold, I would have lost almost 30 thousand dollars.

This takes me to my third lesson:

**Be ready to exit your position, even at a loss, if you feel you will incur more losses by holding on to your position. It's better to take a small loss than a big loss.**

I really didn't want to sell my 5000 BBBY shares. I was hoping that the BBBY shares will go up in price like it did in August. However after analyzing the situation, I realized that the future didn't look bright for BBBY and it would be better I sold and took a $2500 loss rather than holding on to my shares and taking a much bigger loss. Looking back, I sure am glad I sold.

There was another reason why I sold and that's opportunity cost. After analyzing BBBY, I realized that even if the BBBY share price doesn't go down, it will most likely just stagnate and not make me any gains. It would be better to sell my BBBY shares and buy shares of a more promising stock which would make me more gains. That's what I did and it brings me to my fourth lesson:

**In addition to financial gain and losses, always consider opportunity costs and the value of your time. Even if a particular stock doesn't make you lose money, if it doesn't give you gains, then consider the opportunity cost. Consider what you're missing out on by tying your money into this particular stock that isn't taking you anywhere.**

The fifth lesson I learned is that even if your entry point to a particular stock isn't great i.e. you buy in at a high price and the share price subsequently drops, you can improve your cost basis by selling covered calls. This is especially useful for volatile stocks since they tend to have high implied volatility (IV) which usually means higher covered call premiums.

My fifth lesson is therefore:

**Consider selling covered calls to reduce your cost basis and generate some income, especially if you own a lot of shares of a particular stock.**

I'm not going to describe how to sell a covered call here because this post is long enough already but google and youtube will help you there.

Now I've been using BBBY as an example but these lessons are applicable to any risky volatile stock that you decide to trade with. I've traded several different risky stocks such as AMC, Palantir etc. in the past and the lessons I described above are applicable to all of them.

Anyway, that's it guys. I hope this is of some use to you. Please DM me if you have questions and I'll do my best to help. I know that none of the lessons I'm sharing are amazing secrets or anything like that. It's mostly common sense but many rookie traders forget to apply them. I wish someone had taught me these lessons before I started trading stocks which is why I made this post."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Microsoft is planning to use AI technology to revolutionise its Bing search engine and is looking to go head-to-head to take away from Google’s dominance in the space. While this poses substantial upside potential for Microsoft, Google still handles 93% of worldwide searches, and it will take something significant to knock it off its perch. 

While it is interesting to see the initial reaction of investors, it is way too early to call a winner, and it will be worth watching how both of these companies look to dominate the AI industry in the mid to long term."

218,Verisign (VRSN) Stock Review,35,zojavo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zojavo/verisign_vrsn_stock_review/,9,1671319057.0,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

# Verisign (VRSN)

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ VRSN operates 2 of the 13 world’s root servers. Root servers track IP Address with the domain names associated with that IP address. VRSN has been granted a monopoly for .com and .net registrations.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Recurring. Each year domains must pay to keep their domain associated with its IP address so it can be connected to the internet. These prices are set through ICANN. The current agreement runs through October 2026 and at that point VRSN is allowed to raise prices up 10.26. In January 2020 the price was $7.85. This implies an annual price increase of 4% per year. 

§ Revenue is influenced by 3 factors: New registrations, Retention Rates and pricing.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Yes, VRSN leverages its monopolistic position with a high amount of debt. Currently they operate with more debt than they have assets (negative equity). Having said that their interest coverage is a very reasonable 12x given the steadiness in revenue. While negative equity can indicate a company is insolvent, negative equity here showcases their ability to distribute significant wealth to its shareholders through stock buybacks.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, as of their 3Q report they have a credit line outstanding $200 million with none drawn on it. That represents about a quarter and a half of expenses. Given the low customer concentration, the mission critical nature of their service and the nominal cost for businesses, I am comfortable with this LOC. 

§ Additionally, they operate with a negative cash conversion cycle (take in cash before expenses occur).

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ VRSN has been the backbone of the internet for over 25 years and has contracts in place to 2026. The internet works extremely well, and its fees are nominal. To me this translates into a cemented position. Would it be worth it for a regulator to entertain a competitor that is willing to charge $9 or $8 given things work extremely well? Probably not.

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes VRSN’s financials are the envy of virtually any firm. Their average ROA over the past 5 years is a massive 34% with average FCF margins are 60% over the past 5 years and they have virtually no CAPEX.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ Regulatory Entrenchment. They have smoothly operated as the backbone of the internet for over 25 years. This gives VRSN a unique understanding of the internet’s operations as they are the only player in the space. I feel that it would not be worth the risk for a regulator to move to a different provider.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No. Capital is not the issue for this business. Any company could match IP with domain names. What matters here is relationships to get the contract as well as history of strong services, which they have.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ Yes what they actually do is extremely easy, but it is only available to one player. 

o Are their competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, they potentially could be bypassed from blockchains. Blockchain operates outside the DNS system which is used to match IP addresses with domain names. Should the world move on the blockchain, and we start navigating to Google.eth rather than .com or .net they would be cutout as their service would not be needed. This has a minor potential at this point, but is something important to watch for sure.

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, revenue has grown literally every quarter over at least the last decade with margins pretty steady at 60% over nearly all TTM periods.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Probably not. Over the last 5 years revenue gains have averaged at 3.1% per year despite a covid bump

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? 

§ I feel I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes, although growth will be somewhat a challenge

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ They do not pay a dividend.

§ Free cash flow Yields have averaged 3.7% over the past 5 years.

§ Revenue 3 years from now is estimated to be $1.78 billion.

§ With an average FCF margin of 60% over the past 5 years, I believe margin will hold around that level meaning FCF is expected to be $1.068 billion.

§ Over the last 4.25 years shares have been reduced by about 4.25% per year. During this period of buybacks FCF yields ranged between 2.7% and 4.2%. Given that FCF yield is at the higher end of the range I would say they could easily retire 4.2% per year going forward. I will model share buybacks at 3.75% to 4.25% per year

§ Shares Outstanding as of 10/21/22 are 106,016,456. 12/31/25 would be 3.08 years away. This implies shares outstanding 3.08 years from now at 92.74 million and 94.24 million

§ This means forecasted FCF per share is estimated to be between $11.31 and $11.51.

§ If we assume a FCF Yield between 3.5% to 4.5% this implies a Dec 2025 price of $251 to $328.

§ With a current price of $200 this implies a 3-year CAGR between 8.01% to 17.93%

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ Given the historical steadiness of the company and contract through 2026 along with the low-end expectations of an 8.0% annualized return, I feel that this company represents good value at this time given what I feel is a cemented competitive position.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

224,Meta Quietly Reduces Staff in Cost-Cutting Push,34,xkkifw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xkkifw/meta_quietly_reduces_staff_in_costcutting_push/,17,1663802624.0,"Meta Platforms Inc. META -2.72%▼ is planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions, as the social-media giant confronts stalling growth and increased competition, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.

The Menlo Park, Calif., company has begun quietly nudging out a significant number of staffers by reorganizing departments and giving affected employees a limited window to apply for other roles within the company, according to current and former managers familiar with the matter, in a move that achieves staffing cuts while forestalling the mass issuance of pink slips.

The reductions are expected to be a prelude to deeper cuts, according to people informed of the company’s plans. While some savings will come from cuts to overhead and consulting budgets, the people said, much of it is expected to come from reduced employment.

The moves come after weeks of Meta executives publicly discussing the need for hiring freezes and “ruthless prioritization” of its business, while avoiding use of the word layoffs.

In response to questions, Meta spokesman Tracy Clayton referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s July statement that the company would need to reallocate resources toward corporate priorities as pressures mount on the business.

“We’ve been public about the need for our teams to shift to meet these challenges,” Mr. Clayton said. He said giving displaced employees a period to apply for new jobs is a means of retaining talent that Meta might otherwise lose. He declined to say how many employees have been affected by the recent moves.

The company has been slashing its guidance for operating expenses since the third quarter last year but hasn’t previously suggested it would reduce head count through means other than natural attrition.

Among some Meta employees, the process of reapplying for jobs within a limited window internally is known as a sort of human- resources purgatory they call the “30 Day List.”

Meta, as of last year the name of Facebook’s parent company, has long had a practice that employees whose roles are eliminated are subject to termination if they can’t find a new job internally within a month. Many other companies also make efforts to reassign employees whose groups are closed or restructured.

At Meta historically, it was usually only employees that were deemed undesirable who failed to land new positions. Now, affected employees and managers say, workers with good reputations and strong performance reviews are being pushed out on a regular basis.

Meta reported having 83,553 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 32% from a year ago.

As part of its own cost-cutting measures, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -1.79%▼ Google has also required some employees to apply for new jobs if they wish to remain at the company. Last week, Google told roughly half of the more than 100 employees at the company’s startup incubator Area 120 they would need to find other jobs at the company within 90 days, said people familiar with the decision.

Google typically gives employees 60 days to apply for other roles in the company if their jobs have been cut, though Area 120 employees usually receive more time if their projects are canceled, said people familiar with the process.

In March, more than 1,400 Google workers signed a petition demanding that the company extend the typical 60-day period to 180 days for a group of more than 100 employees in the cloud computing division, citing the “barriers to transfer that many workers face.”

A Google spokesman said almost 95% of employees who expressed interest in staying with the company found new roles within the notice period. Alphabet had 174,014 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 20.8% from the previous year.

In Silicon Valley, the staff reductions are notable after the biggest companies hired at breakneck speed through the pandemic. In May 2021, Tom Allison, head of the Facebook app, wrote a memo titled “Why is Hiring So Hard Right Now?” Mr. Allison lamented a “major supply and demand imbalance between our hiring needs and talent availability.” With the shortage of engineers most acute, the company was hiring more recruiters, he wrote, but even those were hard to find.

With the economic climate cooling and the digital-ad market in turmoil, the language from some prominent tech executives is now distinctly different.

“Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Zuckerberg said at a company town hall in June. Separately, the company’s head of engineering issued a call for managers to identify employees who were coasting and place them on remediation plans as a prelude to their termination.

The memo’s brusque phrasing led to considerable jeering and angst in the company’s internal forums, according to posts viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Meta’s share price is off more than 56.6% so far in 2022, and the company’s market value has dropped more than $685 billion since its peak in September 2021 as of the close on Tuesday.

Google has been more resilient but the search giant’s share price is also down 27.3% over the past year. In July, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google would slow hiring for the rest of the year and urged employees to be “more entrepreneurial.” Mr. Pichai said at a conference earlier this month that he wanted the company to become 20% more productive, without providing details on how he would measure the improvement.

Snap Inc. is among the outliers in publicly announcing layoffs. The company last week said it would slash about 20% of its staff after growing its head count by around 65% since the end of 2020.

“We must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,” Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in a memo to staff. He said the company was launching an opt-in talent directory to help departing employees find work outside the company.

Silicon Valley continues to be a competitive talent market, so finding ways to relocate employees within a company can produce benefits, said Allison Rutledge-Parisi, senior vice president of people at Justworks, a professional employee services company.

“It would be ridiculous for a company to jettison a group of people who they know, who they’ve managed, they have a relationship with, who’ve contributed, summarily without thinking through a methodology that would find them another place and another home within the organization,” she said.

There are also potential downsides to having employees compete for a limited number of internal positions, including hits to productivity and morale, said Dave Fisch, chief executive of careers site Ladders. “There’s going to be a lot of chatter, there could be a lot of animosity and finger pointing that naturally starts to arise,” Mr. Fisch said.

At Meta, the hustle to get rehired is well under way.

“I’m a fast learner who is keen to take on a challenge and evidently by this post, someone who’s not afraid to put herself out there,” wrote a Meta data scientist on an internal forum last month, in which she said she was looking for a new position. “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take and I’d be kicking myself if I ended up leaving without exploring every avenue I could.”

230,TSM and NVIDIA,34,y1man3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y1man3/tsm_and_nvidia/,67,1665526967.0,Both are down ungodly amounts. But they are some of the most important companies in the world! How much further down can they go? After losing all my gains I want to re-enter and just go in on the Googles and Apples of the world. But also these two chip giants. When’s a good entry? How come they’ve fallen so hard when they’re so essential?

I don’t like to bet against Elon, but firm believers in this hypothesis, what is a play that you could make in the market? This doesn’t mean a complete collapse of Twitter, but say they lose 20% of users in the next 6 months. Would it be bullish for Meta? Snap? TikTok? Google? Disclosure: I currently only hold googl but am considering buying Meta at support around $75. Thoughts?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.
