Why elon musk should buy Sri Lanka?

- It is in desperate need of $22-$25 billion right now. IMF and asian development bank and other neighboring countries are tired of giving Sri Lanka money.


- Sri Lanka is close to the indian ocean. Elon musk can put a Space X and Tesla factory there. Being close to ocean he can get chinese materials for his Tesla and also use srilankan labors to build his dream.

-  Safe for him to do more crazier space X experiment there because of less strict rules and regulations. 

- Being there he can hire smart scientist from India and China and Russia for cheaper price for his Tesla and Space X factories.

- Buying Sri Lanka he can meet new ladies there and spread his seeds in all continents and be real life Iron Man. 

- He can start world domination from Sri Lanka and move to other countries soon!

- people will work for him for rice, chicken, lentils and coconut and 1/8 of salary that he pays in USA üá∫üá∏

- Neuralink phase 1 testing without FDA approval

- Elon can finally fully test his solar energy company and show the world how he can sustain a whole country electricity need just with solar power

- Also, with less strict emissions regulations in Sri Lanka, Elon can make a V8 version of the Model S!"

&#x200B;

[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=56e3c99d9a5a3704f8fb491a17925c521537f4e4)

...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  


My Thesis on this Play is as follows -  
I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

  
After the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

  
‚Ä¶Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it‚Äôs lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- ‚ÄúBuy Buy Baby‚Äù. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.

  
With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC‚Äôs cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)

&#x200B;

[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45b2bf08a477ee2051fdf97676961572c3222022)

  
As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  
That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.

  
Again, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I‚Äôm glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.

  
So again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of ‚Äúmeme basket‚Äù and bed Bath & beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.

  
So back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME‚Äôs stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.

  
I waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time‚Ä¶ either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.

  
As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  
Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.

&#x200B;

[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0eefe610e6a812f3d3a378e1c6d0a8f4109d87f)

  
After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post‚Ä¶ I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)‚Ä¶.  
Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

  
The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  
So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  
Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

  
Thursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

  
Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  
So yeah‚Ä¶ I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  
Again, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of ‚ÄúMOASS‚Äù like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.

  
As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  
 It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.

  
In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).

In regards to the Yolo‚Ä¶

  
I Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, & the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  
I decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why‚Ä¶.

**Listen Up,**

I hate to interrupt while you are planning your wife's and her boyfriend's romantic getaway for the Independence Day weekend. With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.**

Before I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: **this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.**

So get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let‚Äôs go.

# Part 1: The lore of the electric K√§fer

Spool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the ‚Äú(not so) secret master plan‚Äù of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot **harder and more complex than initially thought**. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.

https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b8d9e90cdf1d97cd0266f1f423f7079b7c384376

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‚Äòll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting

>‚ÄúHumans are underrated‚Äù.

**Heartwarming**.

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1e6ede5055cfdc77c73d321d9cefb72867a7468f

When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, **this bombshell hit the wire:**

https://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=897bdbbbe4408ea7803f724bab31eb8aaf8e2fd4

**If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.**

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up [TSLA](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.

https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c393b85ebdac48b4ed5c64b2ef3f8644d5937d66

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.

# Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, **we are now going to war.**

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. **They combine everything MBA‚Äôs are afraid of.**

* Insanely capital intensive
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)
* Humongous unionized workforce
* Stiff competition
* Razor thin margins
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)
* Supply chains longer than the river Nile

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.

**No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.**

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.

Famously, Railroads are really ‚ÄúTransportation‚Äù companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.

**That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don‚Äôt need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA‚Äôs darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.**

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?

https://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55b4e3bfe272601ade332b6ed2b91d028d605df2

Damn right. **Warren Buffet.** The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don‚Äôt we take these attractive business models

[Are you getting it?](https://preview.redd.it/67vg4z62bx891.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=121d81826f20d730e801b0d3a5b07d5cadb7ab2b)

And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can‚Äôt we? **We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.**

https://preview.redd.it/i2nmy697bx891.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b6c0fec2b0528630036215740e2af0bd8f25e3e0

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don‚Äôt bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.

**Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.**

https://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4c05b6d5ce8ae7675e951da86138aa8eb420687

Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a **99.999% stock based compensation** plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.

[Head of Tesla cheerleading team with her girls.](https://preview.redd.it/pk7jor6pbx891.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e318e7b5007dc2a8cc57f3e58d61dde2de0903b)

Enter 2020. After a short rally into February, **a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down**. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, **this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.**

Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**

&#x200B;

# Part 3: Liftoff

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.

**So how do we fix the valuation?**

https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7e96fb6a6663021e2bc95501ae6c85cd9cb6d03

After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  **Hype, momentum and FOMO.** Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

**You bet!** Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. **Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.**

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a **baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.**

https://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cda17d080a87d2e40e12f0bbbfebca77e7d47f08

**Everyone, EVERYONE** was buying calls, **WSB** was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.

Even **Softbank** bought calls. The biggest and most Vapid unicorn VC. The poster child of dumb money. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise the final round before going public or broke. Even they decided to decided to chip in. **And in a big way.**

[A Billion Dollar VC fund suddenly gambling their portfolio money on call options is a bit unusual. ](https://preview.redd.it/ll1hhzzwbx891.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93ea316c861ce41173b962d2390846aad2a6b87f)

Thank you for your service! **Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was.**

All brought Tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of **1 Trillion USD.** We gave back some of these gains but **the valuation can still be described as ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù lofty.**

https://preview.redd.it/ddg5aq6ybx891.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fe6d7685c5a72f59074085020dd48d56297a649

# 4. The short the short shorts short

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: ‚ÄúNever short Tesla‚Äù, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.**

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.

**And as we have learned, the market really can‚Äôt stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.**

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.

[Lets look at the growth rate again. ](https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f78d97ce55ad4df69c5ee59a14ad3a11ce278bf)

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.

**This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.**

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.

https://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73d83fdbc3c90d92e3cb3924f62ad001baeb6427

**Let‚Äôs try to read a bit into the recent clues.**

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are ‚ÄúGiant Money Money furnaces‚Äù we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let‚Äôs see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ‚Öì stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?
12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.

&#x200B;

**This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?**

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow
* Earnings are next month
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.
* Market is closed on Monday.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.

&#x200B;

**I am in. How are we playing this?**

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, **you buy puts.** Depending on your personal risk tolerance **300 strike puts with 1 month DTE** look about right. If you want to play it safe, L**EAP puts for January ‚Äò23 should get you going**. This is where I am at.

**Positions:**

* **5x Jan 20 '23 140 Put**
* **3x Jan 20 '23 300 Put**
* **2x Jan 20 '23 400 Put**

&#x200B;

**EDIT:  Thank you for positions or ban, fucktards**

I‚Äôm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. There‚Äôs a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. 

I may be a little special and I‚Äôm quite baked rn but I‚Äôm going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. 

Firstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. That‚Äôs the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up America‚Äôs battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costly and relying on other countries isn‚Äôt for Uncle Sam. $ABML may have just stumbled upon the answer and if they have the stock is about to go parabolic.

You know that shit Daddy Musk and every other car company puts in his car batteries? The shit that currently costs more than gold at $70k per tonne‚Ä¶ This company has basically found itself with lithium deposits that are the same weight as 128k fat Jonah Hills. That‚Äôs pretty fucking fat.
So back of the napkin math 15 million tonnes X $70k = $1.25 trillion. That‚Äôs right $1,250,000,000! 

And the best part? $ABML controls 100% of the mining lode claims in the Tonopah flats and the subsurface minerals without any royalties. 
The company also plans to expand the area to the north and south of the property and explore to greater depths. 
90% of the 15 million tonnes is easily recoverable.
And if that‚Äôs not perfect enough, their factory is only 25 miles away from the Tesla gigafactory! 

Secondly, this is a company I‚Äôve been following for years, and it‚Äôs fair to say management hasn‚Äôt always been the best. The company is currently down 75% from it‚Äôs ATH of $4 per share, attributable to the slow progress they have made up till now. However, this company is now run by their fairly newly appointed CEO Ryan Melsert, an ex-Tesla employee who realised the importance (and financial benefits) of securing America‚Äôs battery metals supply chain. The guy is an absolute genius, the company has won countless awards and government grants for its unique, patented and environmentally-friendly way of recycling battery metals. 

The whole point of switching to electric cars is to reduce carbon emissions and damage to the environment. This company allows for what may be the most environmentally-friendly and scalable battery recycling process in the world. $ABML have a factory 25 miles from Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory and have signed agreements to recycle Ford, Chevrolet and GM‚Äôs battery feedstock. 

The company is currently pre-revenue, however I do believe that will change this year with the opening of their pilot plant. Despite the negative economic outlook we are in at the moment I can really see this stock outperforming the broader market. They‚Äôre flush with cash despite burning through it due to building their new factory. The amount of Lithium within the Tonopah flats alone is worth more than Amazon. 

Who‚Äôs to say Musk doesn‚Äôt buy the company outright? I really don‚Äôt see that as an impossibility given the company‚Äôs purpose, it‚Äôs location and the CEO‚Äôs ties to Tesla. If that happens I‚Äôd probably need to repaint my ceiling cuz my erection would be doing all sorts of damage to it. Anyway thanks for reading, I‚Äôm gonna post a few sources and go play with myself in my mom‚Äôs basement.

Full disclosure; I have 4995 shares and I‚Äôm looking to increase my position anywhere under $1 a share. 

TLDR - $ABML have $1.25 trillion of untapped Lithium deposits with the opportunity to expand further. They have the most environmentally friendly way to extract/recycle battery metals. Their CEO worked for Tesla and their factory is next to Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory."
91,TESLA CEO ELON MUSK SAID TO PROPOSE TO TWITTER TO PROCEED WITH DEAL AT $54.20 $TWTR,1321,xvj3yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xvj3yh/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_to_propose_to_twitter_to/,594,1664899816.0,"[https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1577329137936654337](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1577329137936654337)

$TWTR paused to volatility. It's happening.

**EDIT:** $TWTR resumed trading. Up 15%. Halted again.

**EDIT 2:** More context:

Twitter shares surged 15% on Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to go forth with his deal to acquire the company for $54.20 a share. The stock was halted after the report.

Musk agreed to the deal earlier this year, valuing Twitter at $44 billion, but he quickly changed course and tried to back out of the agreement. Twitter sued Musk to force him to go through with the purchase. The two sides were scheduled to go to court on Oct. 17.

According to Bloomberg, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, Musk made his latest proposal in a letter to Twitter. Other media have independently confirmed Musk‚Äôs renewed offer.

**EDIT 3:**  Letter Was Filed Confidentially With Court Ahead of Emergency Hearing Tuesday, Source Says -- WSJ

**EDIT 4:** [From WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-proposes-closing-twitter-deal-on-original-terms-11664901454?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

""The billionaire‚Äôs lawyers communicated the proposal to Twitter‚Äôs lawyers overnight Monday and filed a letter confidentially with the Delaware Chancery Court ahead of an emergency hearing on the matter scheduled for Tuesday, the person said.

If Twitter accepts the proposal, the two sides wouldn‚Äôt have to follow through on a five-day nonjury trial set to begin Oct. 17. There are no guarantees they will reach a deal and the trial could still go forward as planned.

Mr. Musk was set to be deposed later this week as part of the preparations for the trial."""

Edit: 5:56 pm est - Going to stop adding for now. Been at this all day. Thanks for the time. Just thought you should know.

some updates 5/4/2023

If anyone doubts anything just ask for the link or file and I'll send it. The largest part of this thesis is that one or two activist investors with reputations on the line are in the play and won't screw shareholders. This is mostly the back story here. May update and add/remove more if this post catches interest again.

If you're visiting here, - also worth checking out AJ's comments on the recent otc listing [https://youtu.be/1BeumQk2o0Q?t=2245](https://youtu.be/1BeumQk2o0Q?t=2245)

jan updates-trimmed some other areas i reached the text cap lol

relevant updates: u/Whoopass2rb found a change of control occurred triggering the abl default with jpm.  was related to their inventory levels.  jpm understands would break the change of control in the original abl, or board changes are significant enough. and/or. look at the 8 board members shuffling around recently, probably a clue there. cash out, removal, then readd to board back with shares, minus  Edelman.

I think whoops theory is probably the most sound - deal set to occur in Jan, but some banks with market maker activities postponed it, via a false ""ftc concern"" - i added that part in, because they were over leveraged short, like TD Canada, who is the largest shorted bank on the market.

Still waiting on form 25 to give us 10 days to the official ""delisting"" although we're suspended and trading otc until then. Puts us at least to the previous reverse stock split vote that was cancelled, and timing of the NT 10K drop, happening at latest if on time, a day after IEP Icahn's company changed earnings from May 3rd, to May 10, that just got heavily short attacked from the 50s to the 30s the last two days.    Jan 19 on paperwork filing, day of suspension, we see Ryan Cohen is an interested party along with Cerberus who was the other known interested party in Baby. Pitchbook shows LBO rumor deal in Jan, as well as the PIPE with Cohen tracing back to March when he received funding from Catterton through Dragonfly.

The 3.02 filed late Jan is for offering unregistered securities i.e. similar to the bond exchange offers for shares -- but no unregistered offering was done. We later saw that. Basically an easter egg (drink kool aid here). HBC acted as a proxy it seemed for a ""institutional investor with the early Feb set up of the subsidiary. The shares done in the offering were fairly minimal by some estimates for failing the price minimums. Different theories here.

Personally I'm waiting for auction process on June 2 - stalking horse bid May 22, and bids in by late May. Sales process June 7th. Some kind of LBO with private equity Catterton involved, imo a share exchange of some sort, reverse triangular merger with GME perhaps (GME created a new sub in Florida May 29 2022 (Gamestop Texas Corp) that may be used for this (Same date, May 29, Cohen sold Chewy to Petsmart btw fwiw.

Gove ceo and Patty Wu president of Baby have a ton of RSU's which would be worthless in BK fyi, along with David Kastin. All star M and A experience across the board with people currently there, not just specialized in bk.

the 11/16 dates mentioned below was also when Cheng of Volition capital who sits on the board with Cohen on 2 companies did a Form D 650 million dollar unregistered security offering - not yet sold....also he tweeted within 40 min of the 10q drop and said 2023 and beyond"" in the tweet

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research we've gathered and verified over the past several months.

Small update: All there offerings have warned of the potential of a short squeeze in several places. The latest chapter 11 events also possibly enable share recalls from previous offerings. Dragonfly board members have stepped down from their posts, along with Brett Icahn at Newell after scheduled to stay. Possible FTC conglomerate concerns? Chapter 11 will reduce the debt considerably and the valuation is low from Cohen's estimates, and he's listed as an interested party.

Why are institutions long on this stock right now if they're in such trouble?  "" **88.7% of all institutions invested believe the price will go up and are only betting on that""** (u/whoopass2rb post). - that was from several months ago, not aware of current standing.

Earnings doc highlights -

Welcome Rewards membership surpasses 16 million, increasing from approximately 6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, reflecting predominantly new members.

Potential to save an additional 80 to 100 million in shipping receiving etc. How would they do that? Seems teaming up with someone else could be a way. - Gme and BBBY center closures in close proximity where another stays open.

On track to deliver approximately $250 million of SG&A savings versus last year for the second half of fiscal 2022, or $500 million on an annualized basis. A going concern sale from the court transcripts is what the court is trying to make happen. Viewing the brand presidents Linked in, she says she's optimistic.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Late filings can be associated with major corporate actions. Some noteworthy ones

Cohen's 13 d/a and Form 4 - Over 3 months late (event date listed - April 21, BBBY's 10 k at the time when share count was declared from buy backs over several months making Cohen's ownership move from 9.8 to 11.8 %. Why so late in filing? The form 144 he filed by the way is signed showing that there was nothing wrong with ""the books"" as some have suggested.

His form 4 shows a financial interest despite having no shares at the time.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822844/000092189522002498/xslF345X03/form413351002\_08182022.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822844/000092189522002498/xslF345X03/form413351002_08182022.xml)

Dec 6 and Dec 19  S4 forms for bond extensions there- NOT FILED BY BBBY yet, at least not to the public. All the other bond extensions had these forms. BTW the new bonds gave second tier lein status. The old notes are unsecured - So who wouldn't exchange them to get a better status in the event of a bk? People convinced the bk is not happening - as well as an acquirer that could wipe out the debt holding them. They only received around a 14% participation rate overall among the three types of unsecured notes.

There are confidentiality options when you're doing M&A. An all cash buyout specific option would not appear to need an S4 according to a professional I referenced although I haven't verified this personally on the SEC website. A share exchange, merger acquisition would need one but they could be filed late. Good finds here by  [u/Dan23DJR](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dan23DJR/)

The N10 Q form filed is also often associated with M&A activity. Their 10 Q was ""planned to be filed by BBBY by Jan 10"" when this was filed on Jan 5. It still has not shown up. The penalties are modest, only severe penalties for late filing after 6 months. The fine is around 25k in this instance. So why the late filing?

If you look at a Tesla example their 10q from 2018 had a EX (exhibit ) 10.1 missing when they acquired a company. This form mentioning this wasn't public until 2022.

Now it's been noted Tesla is the acquirer here and how could BBBY be an acquirer? Worth mentioning, In the share offerings by BBBY they mention the ability to use funds to acquire a company. Good buy Gear - or a reverse merger - perhaps? Just FYI - another company Cohen is on the board of, a private company Dragonfly on Feb 24th increased authorized share count to 123 million shares close to a 1 to 1 with BBBY- A day after the HSR act adjusted brackets for pre merger companies - In a reverse merger a private company goes through a pre existing public company instead of a traditional IPO.

11/16 could be a significant date. Before 11/16 on the SEC Edgar search for BBBY it only showed the main branch but now shows BBBY, BBByCF LLC, BBBYTF LLC, BBB Canada Ltd., BBB Canada LP Inc., and BBBY Management Corp. Although this seems its just related to the 11/16 doc that was finalized on 11/21 this occurred after the first bond extension which could support support findings BBBY has been adding in legalese among the bond offers that makes a major corporate action available.

The form D's for the private bond conversions from 11/14 and 11/16 were also late 7 and 5 days respectively. The 11/16 Form D represents just under 10% of the total BBBY share count and was filed a day after institutional filing cutoffs for 13F's, which means any institutions that manage over 100 million dollars and received this exchange, wouldn't be viewable until this February.

 BBBY showed broken up and 6 subsidiaries listed as of 11/16 on the SEC Edgar search. Possibility of some kind of pooled investments, under 5% reporting limit each, although very rare. Judge wants to see holders of 4.5% or above, perhaps so BBBY maintains less than 49% of shares outstanding under one entity to maintain up to 1.6bil in tax credits through chapter 11. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current marketcap

RC Ventures letter to the board written March 6th, put the value of Buy Buy Baby  above the entire marketcap of BBBY at the time of 1.28 bil vs current .429 bil. Or 2.56 billion next day when it ran to $30 lol.

[March 7, 2022 when letter filed on SEC site $19 - $30 candle from $16 day previous](https://preview.redd.it/ttwcmwlu40ca1.png?width=161&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d35bfebe6ef26a8310fe4ee844c0413075133e4)

BTW in 2015 for example, BBBY had 174 million shares and reached 79 dollars a share a 14.6 b marketcap . It reached an almost 17 bil mktcap in 2013.

We're currently trading below 1992 marketcap  factoring in inflation (u/n3rdacalypso) [https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zsybmx/bbby\_historical\_market\_cap\_total\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zsybmx/bbby_historical_market_cap_total_shares/)

Sycamore supposedly made an offer for Gamestonk in 2018 too btw, nothing burger/distraction.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Other options for acquirers of BBBY - private bond conversions- amount done and known of -14.5 mil cumulatively.   Outstanding share count btw is 117.3 mil

The bond deal didn't get adjusted really on extensions after the first deadline of Nov 15th - just small modifications. Which means they didn't really care if people converted the bonds to new notes- most likely (speculation here) because an acquirer can gather \*bonds at was has been mostly 1/5th of their full value over the past year. Now even cheaper, wiping out debt cheaply.

Speculation part - [u/1nceAgainTip](https://www.reddit.com/u/1nceAgainTip/) Brought up a really interesting scenario. Imagine BBBY files the form that panics many.  After the filing, the limited partner approaches (Icahn ) with the majority of the notes - They convert to shares at the current share price like what was done in the other form D private exchange but post Jan 2. Cohen and Icahn get majority ownership above what Cohen had already done through the M&A with the S4's in December being finalized. Brining collectively their share count in the company from 19.9% cap under the standstill running through Jan 2, to 50? 70%? including what they picked up on the open market.

Food for thought - dates around the bonds (speculate amongst yourselves section) 9-28 Icahn buys 10 mil shares of IEP 86% ownership one day before BBBY earnings on the 9/29. 10-17 Icahn / Cohen pic tweet\*. 10-18 bond offering of BBBY.  11/14 and 11/16 bond private conversions. 11-16 first extension filing of bonds to 11-18. 11-19 first teddy (LLC bank holding company related ) tweet \*. 11-20 date of Cohen interview...\*(see my interpretation post) 11-21 IEP original ask of 1.2 bil in July adds 400 mil on 424b5. 11-21 bond offering extended to 12/5. 12-6 late filings of form D's private conversions.

\-----------------------------------------------------

**Their ATM offerings have all included the option for private sales.**

Also in Game stonks most recent call- they talked about being able to acquire companies ""at the right "" price. Specifically they mentioned in the used market - Good Buy Gear is in partnership with Buy Buy Baby and Good Buy's Ceo talks of massive opportunity and big things coming on her Linked in.

Cohen sold at time BBBY needed its FILO deal done. 375 million Filo - Cohen's proceeds of 189 million represent 50.4% of that. u/whoopass2rb and I found that Six street has been known to also do Mezzanine loans.- What if someone /some entity could acquire the ABL debt and or FILO, and get better terms due to their better credit rating? Specifically with the FILO- it could be converted to Mezzanine debt in the form of shares, or warrants convertible on X date if X price is met for example. If someone were acquiring the company- that could be a quick way for them to get majority ownership. The share counts, along with preferred, warrants etc. is extremely hazy and complicated and designed to be that way. The 4.5% will remain private with the court. AST as well as Computershares were both recently down at the same time. AST, BBBY's direct registration was down for over a week online.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Game stonks basically , depending on where you start did a 26x (2600% increase) over 14 days including non trading days.

At the time I posted this - (trimming down some sections hitting text limit) i mentioned the ttm pro looked like a powder keg- We did the run in February up to a fast 7 the same day (also the day of a filing though for the PIPE which was not used in large effect ultimately.

\------------------------------------

Team representing BBBY

Under the standstill agreement that ran through Jan 2 BBBY had from Cleary Gottlieb

2 time deal maker of the year Paul Shim. And someone who did over 4 acquisitions for Google. I would call that a heavy hitter team. David Lopez is there as well, and has extensive experience with IPOs.

If you do a search on Cleary Gottlieb's wikipedia - you can see a number of major M&A deals they've done over the years with US public companies.

Here's some examples -

In 2018, represented the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox on antitrust matters related to Disney‚Äôs $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleary_Gottlieb_Steen_%26_Hamilton#cite_note-22)

In 2018, advised on the $146 Billion Sprint T-Mobile merger.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleary_Gottlieb_Steen_%26_Hamilton#cite_note-23)

BBBY switched from Berkeley Research Group (where a board member of Dragonfly used to be ) to Alix partners recently. CEO of Icahn Enterprises IEP was a head over there prior to being with Icahn.

The fud you'll hear is that how they work with bankruptcies. Just like when BBBY was reported (but never verified) to be in talks with Kirkland and Ellis. Even though Kirkland and Ellis was named 2023 M&A firm of the year. As well as in 2021 and 2020.

\---------------------------------------------------------

GMEDD interview and Cohen speculation

GME flush with cash after the sneeze, bought back their bonds that would have prevented a merger (on Super somewhere , have to find it but it's in the bond terms). GME of course has short term treasuries earning interest right now (283 million worth) they could use quickly.

(speculative) - With treasury notes you can only have 50 in your cart at a time according to govt website.

First remember the timing of ""At least her cart is full"" tweet on Aug 12 , 4 days before his sales on 8/16 and 8/17 - is this dude gonna lose his whole future of activist investing he started with Game stonks, or have changed his mind on the company within 4 days of tweeting a signal like that?

And actually, if you see how he worded things he mentioned  he was critical of the buy backs and the cash burn of the company at the time of his letter in March. He goes on to say, when i saw that, and I saw ""the results"" he sold. The thing people often attribute his sales to is the situation he walked into knowingly.

His sales at the time represented 50.4% of the Filo in late Aug that BBBY was looking to get. Among other things - If he is on the board of his holding company he formed in July 2021 Teddy Holdings, on the Dragonfly board, Game stonks, and to have ownership of BBBY at the same time where he crossed the 10% threshold to mark on the form 4- Just consider Elon's drawn out legal battle involving Solar City (picking up a company his shareholders say amounted to a bailout) and what happened at Oracle with Ellison. As a matter of fact - Teddy being a bank/ holding company has restrictions on executives being across boards.

Teddy and his kids book is more than that. The privacy terms talk of merger and acquisitions. Looking through the terms it is not boiler plate at all.  There are links to the intellectual property trademarks for teddy dot com, filed through his law firm at Olshan - and the rest of the trademarks for an array of products including linens, toys, shower curtains etc. And a lot of the same categories of Gmerica's trademark which was approved for use as of Aug 23rd .

Speculation - Is it likely RC would create a competitor? I don't think so. In his interview he mentioned he's not interested in starting something up from scratch again like Chewy. In Game stonks history though, a holding company was formed and the former chairman of Babbages ended up being the chairman of the new holding company.  ""The merger was structured as a [stock swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_swap), where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed [holding company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company). Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop#cite_note-SoftwarePeers-9) Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar.

A share swap is considered a vastly harder position for shorts to be in. You can read more about that elsewhere.

RC has also removed Game stonks from his twitter profile. Replaced it with the Book King, then removed that as well. Game stop Inc out of Minnesota is interesting. It holds all the IP rights of Game stop. Recently Liberty Procurement , a subsidiary of BBBY set up shop there ( u/hollyberryness found). Liberty only has a handful of branches in other states, the last happening in 2012. Why setup in Minnesota?? BBBY holds their IP rights under this Liberty subsidiary.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form 4 Cohen files after sales in Aug- pecuniary interest listed (financial interest). Letter to board referenced ""financial sponsors interests"" -

Jan 3- standstill of 19.9% cap ownership of shares among affiliates of Cohen removed. Standstill ran from March 25 through Jan 2. - Any statement - including the one released by BBBY about partnership after his sales had to be approved by both parties (Cohen and BBBY).

You can check the supplemental forms by BBBY (as mentioned as relevant in the standstill and their bylaws) to confirm the Jan 2 date is the end of the standstill.

Cohen can buy again now as of Jan 3 whereas before he was restricted. Check his twitter post about the jewel if you want some tin along with Icahn talks about a jewel on CNBC interview. Tinfoil aside....

10 days after being over 5% share ownership then you have to report on a 13d. Which could be as early as Tue.

Current share count 117.3 million BBBY - The standstill would have allowed 23 million shares owned.

Now a filing in Oct is really interesting- the way BBBY worded things. You can check my post titled ""BBBY share count discrepancy...."" It's not really a discrepancy. But basically...

Oct 25 and or Oct 26 there were 4 million + shares issued as part of their initial 12 million share offering. We had the biggest one day move UP on Oct 25 compared to the previous (over) 45 days of trading. Would that have happened if it wasn't for private sales? Decide for yourself.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**New hires and removals**

David Kastin comes on Dec 12\* (great catch  @ adropot  on twitter) .Ben Rosenzweig, an activist investor from Privet steps down from the strategic committee exploring options for Buy Buy Baby on Dec 20. So Ben out, David is in the since Dec 12. Check David Kastin's track record? lol Guy has never joined a company going bankrupt in his whole career. And has a track record of being at companies in  merger /acquisition situations (u/n3rdacalypso).

[https://www.vanguardlawmag.com/case-studies/david-kastin-the-vitamin-shoppe/](https://www.vanguardlawmag.com/case-studies/david-kastin-the-vitamin-shoppe/)

Who has been axed? - Here's a few. Triton former CEO earlier in summer

As of late Aug call- Melnick and Hartman removed as well. Hartman was heading Baby\* with Wu under him. Wu gets new role Buy Buy Baby president.

BBBY recently switched their backend to handle more traffic to their website and fired their former tech head and replaced him. This was reported past few weeks. Would you bother to do so if you're going under?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

speculation -M&A language on phone calls and BBBY materials

Listen to the calls over the past several months, look at the letter to the board from March 7, and look at the materials. ""Unlock has been used repeatedly. Do a google search unlock M&A. it's code word for  sale of an asset, spin off, or merger (I did a whole post on this). RC himself put Buy Buy worth ""several billion"" in the right hands.

\---------------------------------

Insider purchases

You can see insider purchases here- some is outdated- but focus on the new hires. Why would they be buying with their own money? It's common in Wall St not to be invested in your own company. Why would they invest in a company with their own money. Some of these listed are stock grants.

Patty Wu background and Baby president role

Formerly at Mattel COO of Baby division at Honest Company (recently branched out to China). I have my speculation on Baby getting big and a true ""ultimate destination"" for babies, but her late Aug call spelled out how Baby will travel with the parents for the life of the parent- similar to how Chewy (Cohen founded company) approached pet ownership and was able to take on Amazon. Although the value brand line didn't work at BBBY - it works in 2nd tier cities in China across the 200k stores there where you'd get your product in as opposed to opening up your own store. I don't think you can compare the baby segment to bed bath as far as a strategy will go anyway, but there's one example and how Pampers also did the same with their gold line of diapers.

Her new president role as spelled out in BBBY docs includes specifically ""unlocking value""

Further in a late summer call (end of Aug update or Sept earnings) they mention they're on track to unlock value at end of year.

As far as BBBY end of Aug update saying they weren't selling baby, they said ""at this time"" specifically. One thing mentioned in the March letter is a spinoff of Baby. Legally you can't spin off baby until you are solvent, and it requires a shareholder vote within 10 days of announcement. Due to BBBY's financials they couldn't spin off at the time, if they wanted to, so if a spin off was indeed what they are going for, then of course it would make sense for them to phrase it as such.

In the latest earnings call they mention and emphasis exploring ""ALL"" strategic options. Baby sale or spin off is known as the strategic board that Cohen formed and placed people there. I believe exploring all options was a bit of misdirection.

In their filings they change the wording slightly removing partnerships for example in their forward looking statement as a possibility (from u/squaredenis post).

If you already have a partner, then a partner wouldn't be part of a future possibility, it's already done for example. The wording also is ambiguous enough to still include all potentials from previous wordings including aquation, merger, sale of Baby etc.

During the standstill by the way that ran through Jan 2-or Marc 16-  He was allowed open communication with the board at all times.

\-------------------------------------

Speculation section - Babies rus website updated on Oct 31 for the first time in 2 years (check the waybackmachine if you dont believe me). Nov 1, two new Dragonfly filings and Catterton - who gave the 500 mil for M&A gets added to the Dragonfly board. May or may not be relevant.

\-------------------------------------------------

Following the recommendations of the letter sent in March

Reducing exorbitant executive salaries. Cutting expenses, launch new offerings (Mighty Goods at baby) and satisfy customer demand (a refocus of national brands outlined in late Aug call).

Modernizing supply chain (80-100 mll savings as noted in Jan earnings call) improving tech stack (done in Dec).

Some fud you will hear is that they gave their plans away and thus weren't following the closely held moves Game stonks does. But if you actually see the letter he was criticizing Tritons 200 page picture book detailing every single move they would make.

The letter talks about the most value packed option is spinning of Baby shares to shareholders but also includes a sale option to a well capitalized acquirer. For a true spin off several things have to be in place. But also ones outside the box thinking wise. The letter also mentions a partial sale of Baby which may allow additional maneuvering around bond covenants.

\-(Speculation) The letter mentions selling the core business to BBBY to a well capitalized acquirer as well. Icahn IEP his company where he owns over 85% of shares has billions on the sidelines and West Point Home does a lot of business with BBBY - they make sheets and stuff. He talks about a jewel as well (cue latest tweet tinfoil by Cohen and pic of Cohen with Icahn in Oct on twitter).

\--------------------------------------

The Ultimate Destination.

Chewy was described as the Ultimate Destination for Pets in the March letter to the board. Gamestop was written as the Ultimate Destination for Gamers when Cohen wrote to the board  before becoming chairman. He describes Buy Buy Baby as being the Ultimate Destination for babies. To me this screams he's getting it and not letting go. Can you imagine him mentioning the Ultimate Destination for x, every time he approached a company ? If you watch his interviews I think he sees its a business he can scale in a segment with a fanatical customer base. And if you find the little that's written about his long time business partner Blake Day, you'll see the guy is too ambitious to just be part of a full buy out team for Catterton.  Since  the market is not valuing Buy Buy fairly, others won't go as high as what he's offering.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BBBY is closing unprofitable stores. Increased from earlier estimates drastically and focused in as per Cohen's letter by first removing Harmon branches.

Game stonks was set to close about 500 stores in 2020. When Cohen became chairman they moved that number closer to 1000. Perhaps we will see more mentioned soon.

\-----------------------------------------------

Timing of purchases and Catterton connection

Catterton wrote a paper on the maternity and childcare market opportunities in China who recently went from a 2 child up to 3 child policy. [https://www.lcatterton.com/pdf/2021-LC-Crisis\_or\_Opportunity.pdf](https://www.lcatterton.com/pdf/2021-LC-Crisis_or_Opportunity.pdf) found by (u/Movingday1)

Catterton gave Cohen's private company Dragonfly 500 mill for M&A. A day after announced, Cohen buys last of BBBY shares, and makes his call purchases days before public announcement.

Catterton has backed companies including Honest Company (Jessica Alba who just entered China) where Patty Wu - new and current Baby president as of late Aug,  was at Honest Company during the time Catterton funded a round for Honest. The China paper was release Oct 6, 2021. Cohen begins his BBBY purchases on Jan 13th, 2022. With his first purchase at 14.769 lol

Olshan , Ryan's law firm has been making changes to BBBY's board, helping current CEO Gove  arrive there in 2019 as well as board member Kirwan. and Schechter, directors still on the board.

Dragonfly total listed acquisitions (full buyouts their specialty listed on Crunchbase as of today only total around 30 million, and that's if you account for them doing all of the funding. Which means if the 500 million was specifically for Buy Buy Baby- Well over 450 million may be available to help that. Catterton moves big money around is regularly over subscribed to their funding rounds.

Edit: Found the link, they were hoping to raise 7.8 billion [https://www.wsj.com/articles/l-catterton-seeks-nearly-7-8-billion-for-new-funds-11638914599](https://www.wsj.com/articles/l-catterton-seeks-nearly-7-8-billion-for-new-funds-11638914599) \- And if you look at Catterton's acquisitions as of late, in 2022, they are modest so far.

\------------------------------------------------------

Dragonfly speculation section

Dragonfly added a new branch and a new officer for the first time in 2 years - from Catterton - a big funding wing related to LVMH (an over 50 billion dollar stock that includes Louis Vutton among others. The Catterton guy has a track record of being focused on companies in the 2 to 3 billion dollar market cap range.

Whether or not Dragonfly is directly involved where Larry Cheng of Gamestop, and Blake Day a long time business partner of Cohen is  up for speculation only. One of the oddest things I've seen is that Dragonfly's outstanding (not authorized) common stock changed by 2 total shares this year out of over 9 million (which seems to point to the ""Ryan Cohen by day, Warren Icahn by night"" tweet, but I digress).  Dragonfly is an E commerce focused buyout company for Catterton, and their head of M&A started a furniture LLC in Texas with paperwork signed days before the standstill started. It was later confirmed to be directly related to Dragonfly. He also picked up a warehouse through another LLC in Virginia where Good buy Gear paperwork is (a business partner of Buy Buy Baby). And a new branch of Dragonfly opened in Rhode Island which is for some reason associated with real estate via the NAICS codes. - RI is where kids2 expanded out of all places from their initial location in Atlanta. They have several products Buy Buy could sell including educational toys like baby Einstein. The warehouse, Rhode Island branch, and the new member of Dragonfly were recorded in filings from early November 2022.

The China market is hot with tutors and the government is trying to get people to have more babies. If they further crack down on tutoring as can be seen in china tutoring companies stocks, the next logical place is educational toys for them to turn to? When Wu was at Mattel, I believe she worked on this angle as well from a Linked in Post. Also Good Buy gear (if you check my furniture post) said big things ahead. Their paperwork for an LLC is not standard and  mentions options for current shareholders in the event of a buy out. Most LLC's don't have such detailed paperwork. To make the ultimate destination for babies, it seems this would be a good company to add, rather than just giving customers gift cards for their gently used baby gear and then reselling to Good Buy Gear which Buy Buy currently does.

As of December Games stonk cobranded with Cybercrew whose other work has several other brands highlighted. I'm sure if there was an issue Louis Vutton and Nike and Apple and others shown in their NFT's would be filed against in a suit and they'd be removed) (credit u[/edwinbarnesc](https://www.reddit.com/user/edwinbarnesc) ) but that has not happened. There was also a big fuss about Kagy leaving Gamestop but he left and has a role as head of Cybercrew and Protocol Gemini, which is working on metaverse pads and experiences. Dragonfly has branches in each state  corresponding with the states shown in the main Gmerica nft's (5 shown so far).

Ok, im getting off topic. going to go back through and add more solid DD that should be known...

FYI a ton of people not mentioned collectively all found this. I'm just putting it together here.

Just a small piece of tin - The Bulid Buck BunnY (BBBY) store is next to Game stonk in this Gmerica NFT (a double decker bus obscures the view in the gif / nft, you have to paste it together). And the hidden secrets txt from the game stonk nft website from this last July has BBB (Buy Buy Baby) and BBBY in the skull as the only letters on those rows. I've also confirmed someone working with Metaboy who did the Gmerica NFT, that hey have a non disclosure agreement with Metaboy.

In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). It‚Äôs amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isn‚Äôt being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable and revolutionary as many of these companies still claim to be. Look at Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúself driving‚Äù being a complete failure in actually delivering what was promised. It‚Äôs recent leaks show insult to injury with its thousands of ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù complaints. There have been no notable advancements since 2017 in AI (with the Vaswani et al paper), but these companies and singularity loving redditors would love for you to believe so. This type of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is nothing but a trend, and an arguably unethical one at that. It has the potential to boost productivity substantially, but it‚Äôs as close to replacing white collar workers as robots are to replacing blue collar ones due to its lack of high level reasoning. True general intelligence to replace workers advances incrementally which is still up for debate if it can even be done at all.

132,RIVN is undervalued and oversold‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leveraged to the tits üå∞üå∞,812,13cn3hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13cn3hx/rivn_is_undervalued_and_oversold_im_leveraged_to/,784,1683632161.0,"Today I want to tell you why Rivian, the electric car company that is best known for moving people down tax brackets, is now a buy.

Scroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.

&#x200B;

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian‚Äôs market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

&#x200B;

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They‚Äôve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn‚Äôt a grandstanding visionary. He‚Äôs slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn‚Äôt have close friends, is cut off from his family and can‚Äôt hold down a relationship. There isn‚Äôt a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they‚Äôd need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn‚Äôt a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn‚Äôt as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

In a Monday note, JPMorgan trimmed its Tesla price target to $385 from $395, representing potential downside of about 41% from current levels. The call came after Tesla announced weaker-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 254,695 over the weekend.

That's well below the 310,000 vehicles delivered in the first quarter, below JPMorgan's original second-quarter estimates of 315,000, and slightly below consensus estimates of 257,000, which were updated to account for the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in China.

""Lower production in Shanghai due to factors outside Tesla's control is likely the largest contributor to the production shortfall pressuring deliveries during the quarter,"" JPMorgan said.

Motorcyclist dies in I-15 collision with Tesla on autopilot, UHP says     
      
By Linda Williams, KSL.com | Posted - July 24, 2022 at 9:48 a.m.              

DRAPER ‚Äî A motorcycle rider died after being hit by a car on I-15 in Draper Sunday morning.

The motorcycle was southbound on the freeway near 15000 South when a Tesla hit it from behind about 1:10 a.m., according to Utah Highway Patrol.

The impact from the collision threw the rider from the motorcycle and the rider died at the scene.

The Tesla's driver told investigators he did not see the motorcyclist. The car's autopilot was on at the time of the crash, UHP said.

""Just because your vehicle may be equipped with driver-assisted settings or auto-pilot features, all the vehicles still require the operator of that vehicle to still be attentive and still be watching the road,"" said UHP Cpl. Michael Gordon, adding that there was little that the motorcyclist could have done to drive more defensively.

The motorcyclist's name has not yet been released."

Do you all not remember the famous **Volkswagen** (**VW**) squeeze of 2008? Shit went ballistic and **gained like 400%+ in 2 days**. VW became the world's #1 most valuable company for a short time during the squeeze. ***(Estimations shorts lost almost $40 billion.)***

**-** **HerbalLife** **(HLF)** got squeezed when Ackman and Icahn duked it out....Icahn won and walked away +$1billion, ***Ackman covered for double his entry, so figure out that loss*** LMAO.

**-** **Tesla** **(TSLA)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $40 Billion in 2020)*** \- *I don't need to hear about how great TSLA is*. TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.

**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better.

**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the ""value"" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point.

Now I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Strategic news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**

Shills, let's see you change my mind...

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages. Let me repeat to you extra regarded apes in the back. SQUEEZED FOR FUCKING AGES with billllllions in losses. It CAN happen again and will continue to happen over and over and over forever until shorting a stock is illegal.BBBY to the MOON mothfuckas! GODSPEED**

*Disclaimer:\*This is not financial advice. The stock market casino IS gambling and you SHOULD expect to lose money. Please gamble at your own risk. Call 1-800-GAMBLER if you need help with a gambling problem.I am long BBBY with 2000 shares and will be holding for WHEN it hits $100 and beyond.*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\* EDIT FOR ALL THE EXTRA SHILLY ONES OUT THERE WHO ARE 100% CONFIDENT BBBY = DEATH: \*\*\*\*\**Please excuse my rounding below. The numbers are perfect but fairly close to make my point.*

**GME RECAP** of all the times it **""died""** like **BBBY** lol\*\*:\*\*  
$4 --> $160      *(+3800% or so)*  
$160 --> $60   **(-62%. It's definitely dead and done. Was fun while it lasted)**  
*But wait, there's more!*  
$60 --> $500    *(another +700-800% or so run)*  
$500 --> $39   **(-92%. Okay, NOW it's safe to say it, definitely 100% without a doubt D.E.A.D. Nothing can come back from -92%)**  
*Think again mothafuckas!*  
$40 --> $180    *(yet ANOTHER +400% rip over 2 days. That was quick)*  
$180 --> $85    **(-56%, 3rd time is a charm. Never again will this shit see a price above $100 or I'll eat a monkey dick. That last one was a fluke.)**  
$85 --> $340    *(ANNNNNND ANOTHER +300% moonshot. Thank you sir, may a have another?)*  
*etcetera...*

**TLDR #2: No one knows shit. So stop acting like everyone knows this is mooning or tanking tomorrow or the next day or any day after that. Stocks are gambling. LFG! LMFAO**

EDIT #3 : BBBY needs to keep interest/announcements/catalysts coming. THAT is what squeezed TSLA and THAT is what squeezed GME. BBBY has a solid shot just like anything else if the positive news can keep flowing regardless of what it is exactly."

Twitter shares jumped more than 22 per cent to end at $52.00 on Tuesday, after a securities filing showed Musk intends to go ahead with his April offer of $44 billion to take the company private, signaling an end to a legal battle that could have forced Musk to pay up.

Icahn paid in the mid-$30s a share for the stake, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The estimated profit for Icahn Enterprises LP could exceed $250 million, it added.

Icahn made the investment on the belief that Tesla Inc chief Musk wouldn't go through a trial that he looked likely to lose, the report said. He also believed that the stock was worth close to the mid-$30s in the long term.

Other investors, including D.E. Shaw Group and Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, also placed bets on Twitter shares in recent months and could make sizable gains as well, according to the report.

193,Its time to go long on VIX/ UVXY calls... July is going to be a bloodbath,398,vw7sc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vw7sc0/its_time_to_go_long_on_vix_uvxy_calls_july_is/,215,1657507110.0,"Why I am long VIX/ UVXY Calls‚Ä¶

Picture this‚Ä¶ the year is 2022‚Ä¶ we just had the worst 6 months in market history since the 70s‚Ä¶ yet somehow we are magically now having the best start to Q3 since the 80s‚Ä¶ Does that make sense to you? No? Good! Keep reading my friend! 

Before we go any further‚Ä¶ the ‚ÄúYou cant TA the VIX‚Äù comments‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt hurt you little fingers typing that‚Ä¶ I tend to disagree and believe the VIX is very trending when it wants to be‚Ä¶

Here my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?

Green channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.

Orange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7

You also see we just broke major ‚Äúsupport‚Äù on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven‚Äôt made a recent higher high since May 2nd. 

Time wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX >25.5.

Okay still with me here?

IF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX ‚Äúbottom‚Äù tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn‚Äôt have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. 

This means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. 

Current positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn‚Äôt properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th. 

https://preview.redd.it/hn683uk2qua91.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1384fa9e27844b69c2f3df1a086a04c34bc6008

What does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù and see ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn‚Äôt quite seal the deal. 

If my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. 

The one question that we don‚Äôt know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. 

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel

The week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven‚Äôt already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. 

What if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ss5gzz93qua91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fd3f8e2cc5022e7f156059bad29bc2f4018f835

IF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don‚Äôt see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. 

All I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC‚Ä¶ Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July. I think July is about to be capitulation month for SPY and the markets."

**Hey you on the other side,**

&#x200B;

Yes it‚Äôs you I'm talking to. C'mon don‚Äôt look away. What are you doing here reading this sh9tpost? Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be out enjoying the 4th of July all day? 

C'mon now please don't tell me you don't have friends. Even geeky people do have someone. And if you really don‚Äôt then go get your keys and wallet and drive straight to your family or relatives. Today is the day the United States was declared independent by Continental Congress on 4th July, 1776 when American colonies threw off the yoke of British rule and adopted the Declaration of Independence. 

Today is not the day you are supposed to be sitting, crying or sobbing in your room all alone. So just go out there, definitely go wild and just be free for this day and I mean in a good way. Definitely not going all terminator today. I highly discourage you to do that ever in your life. In morning just go visit and later have lunch and discuss some serious issues that need to be addressed and raise awareness. 

If you're from the investing world go tell the true truth and i mean the real one we learn everyday which some of the people from other sectors really don't know about. Because the media both social and televised one kinda brainwashes people with wrong facts or when the event is at its highest peak. And then later at night enjoy the fireworks and definitely get drunk.

So from the bottom of my heart i.e. ventricles i congratulate you a ‚ÄúHappy 4th of July‚Äù

&#x200B;

Holy shit i think i fucked up. Sorry about this nuclear S and F bomb i dropped on you especially traders. So please bear with me. Okay!

&#x200B;

**Previously on Wall Street :**

&#x200B;

[Post June Fomc rally. Green candles in July, August.](https://preview.redd.it/th5a2s9tyk991.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5204b00f5ee672791eabad58cb31ca2d35a0ac76)

&#x200B;

My old viewers know that I called for a March post Fomc rally then a Q3 rally where the bottom will be June Fomc and then post Fomc we rally and hence July and August will be green on monthly candles. Only to crash starting September triple witching week or October 23-27.

if you remember guys i was quite adamant that i wont flip flop from my predictions which i made back in April when March rally was fading. Well folks, I have to say I'm about to flip flop now. Now I could be right and we go up but the odds of me being wrong have definitely gone up. 

So in this post I will address how I am about to be wrong, my reasons for it and at last an experiment demonstrating with chart where we will fall and then rise and then fall and then rise and then fall.

&#x200B;

**So the sentence have now become like this** 

**‚ÄúWe make a bottom on July 26-30 either in July fomc or Gdp July 28 Q2 adv est‚Äù And now after making a bottom and pricing recession we go up in August for a bear market rally and then we sell out somewhere in August making a bottom in September. Now my guess is it's gonna be a week of triple witching. But let's see later on that.**

&#x200B;

Now before we begin let‚Äôs take a deep breath and now please shit as much as you can on me in the comments down below. I definitely deserved that.

&#x200B;

**Now after shitting lets see how much of a loss i made for you guys.** 

&#x200B;

If you're my old viewers, you know I told to ‚ÄúDca index, especially Nasdaq somewhere in June fomc‚Äù and cautioned not to gamble on stocks here because if you really wanna do then find something that won't get Fud.

&#x200B;

[2.5&#37; up doesn't look bad :\)](https://preview.redd.it/9dup38kwzk991.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=173e6a668569b51ce99ad7dae9d8687d212671fe)

&#x200B;

Well look at that we were supposed to follow a green path ( min a short or max a big one ) but look like we are unable to break the red Ketlner line and are probably heading down. But currently we are making a profit of 2.5%. So i guess ahhh not that bad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Now lets Experiment : Swing trade July.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**For people :** 

* This advice is mostly meant for traders and not investors whose investing goal is in a long term horizon lets say minimum 15 yrs. 
* My investing approach is simple Dca at key levels. Have cash in hand plus a secured job to be ready for Dow Jones -89% drop or falling around 200 monthly moving average.

&#x200B;

My own one trick pony approach : Swing the 2nd bear market rally and let‚Äôs sit on the sidelines until there is at least -50%+ in all indices. You could also short after selling in bear market rally that is entirely up to you.

For no risk investors like billionaires : Just sit out and don‚Äôt enter until Dow hits 200 mma. Park your cash with mmf in and only in rrp. Even liquid funds ex : t-bills aren‚Äôt safe due to Paul volcker rate risk. Forget about keeping the money in the bank cause there will be a bank run if depression.

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis :**

* July we get -2% above contraction in the economy and also in July, August estimates.
* We are not in a depression coz then these rules will fail and we just keep going down till November 2024.
* A 3 factor world analysis including Gdp, Inflation and Fomc.
* Markets are always forward looking.

&#x200B;

**The reason why i‚Äôm wrong :**

&#x200B;

[New York and Atlanta Fed negative estimates.](https://preview.redd.it/6gxy5f011l991.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d4d2a21bdfd570b8f8ccdc01f5fe4b39348ee705)

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs pretty simple. There are 12 Federal banks in the United states of America. Out of which 2 of them recently came up with their Gdp forecast. These 2 banks have pretty good reputation and are certainly getting traction in the Twitter and Reddit world. So here‚Äôs what they said.

The New York Fed released a Dyse model forecast on 16th June  ( which they say is not from them but c'mon it‚Äôs on their website. Hence maybe signalling something ) that Gdp of Usa was expected to drop to 0.9 in march but they have now revised it to -0.6 in June. 

The Atlanta Fed on the other hand previously had Gdp forecast around -1%. But then came a shock on July 1st when Atlanta Fed have revised their Gdp forecast to -2.1%.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean is you may ask. 

Well one conclusion is simply that now the market will price this in. Meaning it will make a lower low. It didn‚Äôt get time on Friday but it nearly left an impression that it will go and test that support region it made after the Swiss franc surprise hike by 50bps.

&#x200B;

**Historical data for recession :** 

&#x200B;

[Blue line : JHGDP \( Gdp based recession indicator \) , Orange line : Gdp yoy , Graph : SPX ](https://preview.redd.it/4cznen3s1l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=90d8a671b54b273d96f9905d3e88e374f71d7d2c)

So we established above that the market will make a lower low to price recession. But what does it mean to price ? 

It means that markets will make a drop to -30%+ above by September. Don't forget we have discounted QT. But since i established earlier that this explanation is to a basic and intermediate audience therefore we won't dive into that.

&#x200B;

So what does this chart above tell us ?

It tells us that markets have priced out recession before the Gdp yoy growth fell to 0. The red circles below represent that. Meaning before final September Gdp data we might have bottomed providing if Gdp yoy doesn't fall more in Q3 or Q4 adv est data. ( Meaning if we do then make new LL in Gdp contraction and hence more price dropping ) 

The only two circumstance it didn‚Äôt was Stagflation of 70‚Äôs and 2008 recession. But why must the question be in your mind? The answer is pretty much simple. The Gdp yoy fell even more afterwards. So unless there was a proper bottom for Gdp the markets didn‚Äôt stop making lower lows.

Now there is an anomaly represented by a yellow circle. It‚Äôs called the dotcom recession where the Gdp fell dramatically by earnings recession. Though the Orange line i.e our yoy Gdp never fell below 0 but there was a recession. Quite strange perhaps but we will fit this in our recession pricing going forward cause we are doing a simple analysis.

&#x200B;

So now let's take all the recession into account.

Note : % = ( ( L - H ) / H ) \* 100 where L = low , H = high of candles.

&#x200B;

All data is in monthly charts because I'm not that free. Also I'm not using Dow Jones which I should but I'm not. But I should. Damn it's happening again. 400 Bad request.

&#x200B;

* 1970-71 recession ( red circle no 1 )

S&P 500 - H : $109.37 ( Dec 1968 ) , L : $68.61 ( May 1970 ) , Crash : -37.267%

&#x200B;

* 1974-75 recession  ( green circle no 1 )

S&P 500 - H : $121.74 ( Jan 1973 ) , L : $60.96 ( Oct 1974 ) , Crash : -49.926%

&#x200B;

* 1980‚Äôs recession ( red circle no 2 )

S&P 500 - H : $120.22 ( Feb 1980 ) , L : $94.23 ( Mar 1980 ) , Crash : -21.618%

&#x200B;

* 1981-82 recession ( red circle no 3 )

S&P 500 - H : $141.96 ( Nov 1980 ) , L : $102.20 ( Aug 1982 ) , Crash : -28.007%

&#x200B;

* 1990‚Äôs-91 recession ( red circle no 4 )

S&P 500 - H : $369.78 ( Jul 1990 ) , L : $294.51 ( Oct 1990 ) , Crash : -20.355%

&#x200B;

* 2001 dot com recession ( yellow circle. Note : 2002 first lower low and 2003 higher low )

S&P 500 - H : $1530.09 ( Sept 2000 ) , L : $768.63 ( Oct 2002 ) , Crash : -49.765%

&#x200B;

* 2008 Housing recession ( green circle no 2 )

S&P 500 - H : $1576.09 ( Oct 2007 ) , L : $666.79 ( Mar 2009 ) , Crash : -57.693%

&#x200B;

* 2020 Pandemic recession ( red circle no 5 )

S&P 500 - H : $3393.52 ( Feb 2020 ) , L : $2191.86 ( Mar 2020 ) , Crash : -35.41%

&#x200B;

So what can we observe from the above data ?

Recession : -20% to -50% and if you add the banking crisis over it, it goes past 50%.

So our min : -20.34% , max : -49.93% and our average drop : -37.505%

&#x200B;

Note : average drop = addition of all crash data / 8

Now we will be using this data in our ‚ÄúAladdin box‚Äù. Sorry guys it's getting long and boring but honestly this is my way of doing things manually.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs deep dive into the Key events :**

There are only three events we need to watch for. 

* Inflation i.e Consumer Price Index
* Fed Fomc
* Gdp advanced estimates.

&#x200B;

Note : Gdp comes in groups of three. Adv, second and final. Second and final will be released in August and September respectively. Usually they are all the same but this inflation swindler can f things up if it persists.

&#x200B;

[Aladdin Software xD](https://preview.redd.it/tzazplxq4l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a70cca6a03d11b2b5a438f3506b9c7c343aab459)

&#x200B;

But before we do that let me quickly go and grab someone‚Äôs computer in Black rock. For those who don‚Äôt know that I'm a toilet cleaner at Black rock. xD Running joke it is or is it not ;)  

Okay I'm logging in guys and I'm opening this ‚ÄúAladdin'' management software. So here‚Äôs basically what it does in a three factor world.

We will be distributing points from now. As we all know data is either a hit or miss. A miss can be a miss to higher or lower. A hit is exactly as the estimates say meaning they are already priced in by the market.

&#x200B;

So here is how the point distribution system will work.

A miss to lower : +1

A hit : 0

A miss to higher : -1 

&#x200B;

Note : In case anyone wants this full software for their company or for individual purposes just give $5M dollar to Jamie Dimon. He will get it installed for you right away.

&#x200B;

Let‚Äôs now head back to our events

**Inflation : July 13th 2022**

&#x200B;

[Cpi](https://preview.redd.it/4yqys1d35l991.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89a6d258df5e0751cf6b72beff87692e3283ccf6)

&#x200B;

I'm expecting it to come around est. 8.4% or is it 8.2% Just do check guys it's wrong in this photograph.

And do remember if less then  +1

If higher then  -1

&#x200B;

**Fed Fomc : July 26-27th 2022**

&#x200B;

[Fed monitor](https://preview.redd.it/onqmbme85l991.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a0dbc1f46f63994282f7887fd34a618992b4d6b)

&#x200B;

If 100 bps we fall : -1

If 75 bps sideways : 0. This is being projected by Fed monitor

If 50 bps we rally : +1

&#x200B;

**Gross Domestic Product : July 28th 2022**

&#x200B;

Gdp miss to higher : -1

Gdp hit estimates : 0 Currently markets have not priced Gdp estimates i.e. full definition of recession. We will discuss later how much it has priced. 

Gdp miss to lower : +1

&#x200B;

If market are forward looking they will price everything before September. Meaning markets will price somewhere b/w -20.34% to -49.93% if there is no banking crisis.

&#x200B;

**What has been priced for recession :**

Currently ( as of 4th July 2022 )

&#x200B;

S&P 500 - H : $4818.62 ( 4th Jan 2022 ) , L : $3636.87 ( 17th June 2022 : This number looks very funny i‚Äôm starting to doubt myself xD ) 

Crash calculation : -24.524%

&#x200B;

% of recession priced in by markets  = ( x% ( currently ) / historical recession low ) x 100 

&#x200B;

Best case pure recession : Historical recession low = -20.34%

Probability % = 100% already priced in.

&#x200B;

(Everyone is looking at it)\*\* Average case pure recession : Historical recession low = -37.505%

Probability % = (24.524/37.505) x 100 = 65.3886% 

&#x200B;

(Me) Worst case pure recession : Historical recession low = -49.93%

Hence probability % = 49% something. 

&#x200B;

What this tells us is that markets are pricing in kinda worst case recession around 50%. As it should because we got one negative quarter of Gdp.

So if we get another negative quarter in July 28, then the market will start pricing another 50% if worst case recession till September final estimates for Q2. 

&#x200B;

**Now comes two scenarios :**

Case a)

What if i‚Äôm wrong again? And market just prices full on recession in July itself and then we start moving up. Then market will just drop -50% from Ath in July itself. You should be just buying puts of 1 month expiry July 28 or later.  If you think that the case is. 

Case b)

And if you still trust me and kinda liked my analysis until now. Here‚Äôs what the market will do exactly and kinda dance on my whim.

&#x200B;

[Two : 15&#37; bear market rally , One : 23&#37;+ bear market rally. Dates are given in chart](https://preview.redd.it/muij34ds7l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=50e429be84caf09b2fe39ba14d6922ac48448738)

&#x200B;

You shouldn‚Äôt do anything until September if you can't comprehend what the chart is showing you above.

&#x200B;

What this is basically telling you is there is gonna be a two 15% rally starting July (one around Cpi and other around Gdp) and one 26% rally in August. Around September Fomc is where you will get your bottom and then the market might have priced in probability % of 99% by then of worst case recession. So that takes S&P500 to $2400-$2600 range. 

Exact number would be $245X . Now this X is something i don't know. So range is $2450-$2460.

&#x200B;

I could be wrong here and i really need to just quit posting sh9t. Or markets starts pricing in things after july 28 and hence eventual bottom will then be a day before September Fomc just like it was for June Fomc bottom and things started pricing in after April Gdp.

&#x200B;

Note : Current levels as of now are higher than bear market tops will be. So don't forget to sell everything if swinging and trusting this case b).

&#x200B;

**Beta calculations :**

&#x200B;

For this i will take just Nasdaq. You guys can calculate beta for your own stocks in a similar manner.

&#x200B;

[Beta](https://preview.redd.it/7krhxcwi8l991.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0253c49cb3add0a27f46e19e1829a84dcea1fcac)

Here is how it goes.

We know that NDX/SPY = 1.29 or sometimes 1.30. So providing if beta remains constant then if price of SPY moves down by -24.524% then the Nasdaq must have made low‚Äôs higher than beta multiply SPY downfall i.e. NDX drop > 24.524% x 1.29 = 31.63%.

Hence NDX fall > 31.63% which actually was 34%. So not exactly close but definitely higher than 31% assumed. Here are pictures down below to prove it.

&#x200B;

[SPY, NDX](https://preview.redd.it/ok1226fn8l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70daa10d17e0b7e1f0d69962176169747d15b0ae)

&#x200B;

How to use this knowledge ?

Well if we assume SPX will fall around 49% then NDX will fall 49% x 1.29 = 63.91% roughly 64% by september. Since the NDX fall won't be exactly 64% but higher and if i roughly wanna assume what that number will be in case i‚Äôm betting this on a casino table of billionaires or millionaires then i would i bet NDX fall by roughly 69% something for sure. xD 

&#x200B;

The other way we can interpret beta is with volatility

.

* A stock with beta greater than 1 tends to be more volatile whereas stock with beta less than 1 tends to be slow.
* It can also be used to measure volatility of stock against its sector.

&#x200B;

Note : Volatility and beta are not the same thing. Also V asset class especially V king have beta higher than 1.67 so for them above 83% drop is coming.

Volatility Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has an annual volatility of 40%, then it would be expected to move up or down 40% in price on an annual basis.

Beta Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has a beta 1.26 in relation to the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ), it would be expected to move at a rate of 126% of the fluctuation of the SPX. (This beta is calculated over a period of months and does not necessarily hold true on a daily basis.) The higher the beta, the more volatile the stock. A beta of less than one indicates that the stock's price is more stable than the market (in general and over a long time period).

&#x200B;

**Invalidation : Here‚Äôs why i could be wrong. Case a)**

&#x200B;

New York Fed forecasted in March (read above sheet of Nyc. march 0.9) that Gdp will be positive. So the market being a voting machine in near term didn‚Äôt price anything until we got close to that April advanced Gdp estimates which signaled start pricing in recession and till final estimate Gdp month we completed a worst case 50% probability recession. 

But this time around the Atlanta and New york Fed has forecasted a recession already. So maybe it‚Äôs time to increase from 50% to almost 99% in July itself. And after that we go up. 

Tbh, this sounds stupid. Markets will die, banks will get broke and all our friends in Apple, Google Microsoft, Facebook except Tesla ( they are prepared ) will be crying because of huge layoffs. Because then it could signal a depression is coming and this 50% drop is just nothing as compared to -89% Dow Jones drop. Plus Fed is still buying Mbs and selling so low bonds. Man the bank reserves are just not there i guess.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

If total pts >= 1 :  We are going straight up after July Gdp estimates. Not directly the day after.

if total pts 0 :       We bear market rally like told above in graph

if total pts <= -1  : Bear market rallies will be tough and not that higher. Don‚Äôt bet on it.

&#x200B;

**Result :**

Case 1 : ( Highly unlikely )

July destruction : Price -50% right here right now by July 28 and open the doors for depression.

&#x200B;

Case 2 : ( Most likely )

Calm selloff : Two 15% rally and one 23%+ rally in august. On 20th September a day before Fomc we bottom. ( because last time it was on the day. Swiss franc was an exception won't count. And in march it was a day before too ) After that we shall see. Also we make a lower low from here now to July 28 because Gdp estimates aren‚Äôt priced by markets. 

I like my odds with case 2.

&#x200B;

Case 3 : So where did this come from. Well it's from my tweet. As I must have said on the latest tweet by institutional level analysis. $2800 - $3200 is the true range for recession because below this institutions believe financial system will struggle.

&#x200B;

Reasons why number $2800 and $3200 :

200wMA was the last time SPX bounced from and it could go a little lower due to QT. Hence this number is on everyone's lips nowadays and you must have heard on news many times.

The $2800 number is pretty easy. It‚Äôs the average recession drop number around 37-38% that we calculated above. For Michael Burry this is the number coming and after this Fed will start QE again. Let‚Äôs see if he right. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Closing thoughts :**

That‚Äôs all I have to say guys. I think i didn't do a great job explaining as i'm busy doing other things. You guys can perhaps improve the model better. My twitter post is kinda weird. It's based on institutional levels sh9t. Meaning think of it as someone sitting in Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan are doing things. 

I just try to give my original content only here for guys because I believe in the future of this platform. I just enjoy posting stuff here and trynna help people not necessarily with trading but just giving out some theories with unique kinds of analysis mostly macro. ( This is the last time I'm swinging. It‚Äôs tough when markets do jump from where we expect but just sell off like i just threw my money to a black hole in outer space ) Something you may not see in any youtube channel or stock trading courses. 

&#x200B;

With lots of love.

A Happy 4th of July once again.

&#x200B;

Thank you

Let me start out by saying that I did not yolo into puts, I was actually smart about it.

My story begins before Monday, I wend back 72 weeks and took the absolute value of weekly tesla percentage move, so last week tesla was up 9% I would take 9 and put it into my table. I did this to calculate the average weekly tesla move and then use this data to sell calls or puts. 

Monday: tesla started the day being 7.5% up (average tesla weekly move over 72 weeks was 7.68%) I took this as an opportunity to sell puts and call. ( I sold 7 jan 27 129 puts and 6 jan 27 155 calls). I waited. 

Wednesday: 2 hours before market close I sold 4 more jan 27 157.5 calls. At this point my breakeven including all the premiums received was 160. keep in mind that last week tesla closed at 133 so that would be a 20.5% move. I though that this was a great trade as tesla only had 1 week over the past 72 with a weekly move above 20% ( 25 oct 2021 was the most volatile week with 22,4%) keep in mind that over the past 72 weeks tesla has moved by 20% or move only once. 

Friday: I am writing this from Wendy's bathroom. As of right now tesla has moved 33% for the week. This is fucking insane, like statistically this is insane. I thought I was smart, I thought I was right, I thought that tesla investor and Elon could not be this challenged, but as it turn out I was wrong. not on my math, my math was correct, but I guess I just never thought that a 300B company can move like a fucking penny stock. 

Conclusion: Fuck, fuck, fuck. Even options profit calculator said that my options have a 94% chance of expiring in the money. (deep breath) I am mad, to be clear I don't actually hate Elon, but I want someone to understand my pain. 

Anyway I am only 20, so I will have time to make a comeback.

So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074aab4603aac6ebb22c8742d06ee325a9a7b1ae

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b47cfba028b2d0d4685bf6893714f526afded492

Something I don‚Äôt talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY rallied too‚Ä¶ those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing‚Ä¶ that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8baa7a27a6d38e1a843f4a4d516abece0d69f66

Now here is something very interesting to think about‚Ä¶ We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the ‚Äúend‚Äù however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a6f5d020f5548567d41718adf38bf2c1c557bff

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn‚Äôt even in question. 

So the question now remains‚Ä¶ did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different‚Ä¶ we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nypazjonymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=859d2154628f7dc723c12eeacaeab3c350e3f27c

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not‚Ä¶

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today‚Ä¶ this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day.

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased.

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow‚Ä¶ that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books‚Ä¶ 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day‚Ä¶

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day‚Ä¶ sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn‚Äôt take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour‚Ä¶ have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me‚Ä¶ a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week."
218,This is why I shorted Tesla TSLA,306,1092iiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1092iiy/this_is_why_i_shorted_tesla_tsla/,377,1673436629.0,"Bloomberg said the question many **investors ask now** is when **Elon Musk** will be ""**foreclosed**"".

The report shows that as of March 2022, Elon Musk has **mortgaged about 52% of his shares** to borrow money. We don't know how much Tesla stock he pledges to fund Twitter. Investors can still rely on Twitter's $44 billion deal to predict some of Elon Musk's predicament.

Elon Musk **borrowed $12.5 billion** from a bank with a **loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 20%**. In the event that the **LTV reaches 35% or more**, this founder will have to **pledge more Tesla shares** or pay to reduce the amount of debt if he does not want to be forfeited.

Based on the conditions from the Twitter contract, as well as the **price of $ 359.2 per share** as of **March 31, 2022**, Elon Musk may have **pledged $ 96 billion of Tesla shares** to borrow a capital of **$ 19.2 billion. USD.**

The **threshold of 35% LTV** is said to have been **reached on October 14, 2022** when the share price of this electric vehicle company fell **below 205 USD/share**. To be able to **return to 25% LTV**, Elon Musk will be **forced to pledge an additional $ 22 billion** in Tesla shares to the bank or accept a partial loan payment equivalent to $ 5.5 billion.

Just a few weeks after the October 14 session, the T**esla founder sold $ 3.95 billion** of Tesla shares even though it was in April and August 2022.

Right after **Elon Musk sold shares to pay debt**, Tesla's stock price **continued to drop 19%** as of December 12, 2022. This is also the time when Elon Musk **sold another $ 3.6 billion of shares** of the electric car company.

In the event that Elon Musk sells all the Tesla shares he is holding, this billionaire can **only endure** if the share price does not fall **below $ 79 / share**.

By the beginning of **January 2023**, Tesla's stock price had dropped to **$101.81 per share**, equivalent to a decrease of **nearly 50% within 5 weeks**.

Again, **the number of bonus shares** in 2018 valid from 2020 through many payments also did not help Elon Musk. Because under **the agreement**, they will not be allowed to trade within **5 years** from the date of receipt. 

26.6B is bonus shares.

219,The Return of Blackberry (BB) - $15.92+/share (2024),300,zxdf4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxdf4g/the_return_of_blackberry_bb_1592share_2024/,237,1672243778.0,"I believe there is a lot of potential in Blackberry (BB).  I'm not a WSBer, but all the investing subs have blocked my posts because BB was caught up in the meme stocks, so WSB is the only place left.  This post focuses on a new product called **Blackberry Ivy**, launched in partnership with Amazon AWS.

If you haven‚Äôt been following BB, they no longer make phones and have transitioned to software. Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Automotive, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Automotive.  To use a crude analogy, Android Automotive is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.

**What is Blackberry Ivy?**

Ivy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.

To give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.

An app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.

The previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.

**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**

BB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \~20M QNX vehicles and \~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).

If all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB‚Äôs total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.

BB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)

**What would this do to the stock price?**

BB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.**

**Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**

There have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)

The inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.

[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e6fe8eeb198eb44c74a24ec3d580b40162bd2468)

BB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.

Re:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)

It's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.

The AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:

https://preview.redd.it/f0o8xzuzwn8a1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33084220a52fb30e29ffeed166e5b77f62cad8f1

Notice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).

Blackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.

**Final Thoughts:**

I'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.  But, I believe BB will be successful and will become many times more valuable than it is now.  Time will tell.  Keep an eye on BB.  Set reminders for Jan 9 and Mar 31 and see if any auto manufacturers have signed-on to Ivy.  If they have (especially if Stellantis is named), come back to this post with a new set of eyes.

I am long BB with a price average below $10 CAD.  I have held for 4 or 5 years (pre-meme).  A merry Christmas to you and your families."

228,"‚ÄúDuring a gold rush, sell shovels.‚Äù - Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) & Autonomous Vehicles",277,13l3z7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13l3z7b/during_a_gold_rush_sell_shovels_advanced/,109,1684428076.0,"‚Äú**During a gold rush, sell shovels.‚Äù** This saying arose following the California gold rush of the mid-19th century when it became clear that few prospectors made money panning for gold while the suppliers who sold them shovels and picks profited nicely. 

**I. Introduction** 

This due diligence report focuses on the *Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)* and Autonomous Vehicles sector. It aims to provide an overview of the industry, including the latest technological advancements, market trends, and investment opportunities within this rapidly evolving field. Mainly, employing the strategy of ""During a gold rush, sell shovels."" The aim is to identify key products and companies within the supply chain that can benefit from the industry's growth and technological advancements. 

**II. Autonomous Driving Technologies Industry Overview**

ADAS & Autonomous Vehicles industry is experiencing significant growth and transformation, driven by evolving consumer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory initiatives. These technologies aim to enhance road safety, increase transportation efficiency, and provide improved mobility options. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning algorithms to perceive the environment and make informed driving decisions. In USA, this industry is regulated by the *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).*

Automakers are moving past passive safety (airbags, seal belts, etc..) into active safety (ADAS features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, etc...).

Automobile OEMs are racing to deliver the first automobile offering level 4 ADAS system. Mercedes currently has level 3 offering to consumers. ADAS unlock a major source of subscription-based revenue for automobile OEMS. 

ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by *The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)*. ADAS can be divided into 5 levels:

[5 levels of ADAS\/AVs](https://preview.redd.it/fzfjl9nn5m0b1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88f6a64d59eda5088696454a11be86b0c71bb758)

**III. Government Regulation**

*National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)* and other agencies around the globe will regulate ADAS requirements and standards. Germany is leading the way with the USA following closely behind. Most likely, AVs will be required to have more than one type of sensor (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonics/sonar) to offer level 3 and above ADAS features. This is due to requiring a high degree of redundancy for safety reasons. 

In my personal opinion, Tesla's pure camera vision is a bust. This is evident by the increasing number of accidents involving Tesla when Autopilot was engaged. Also, certain environmental factors can hinder cameras useless (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc..). Elon will never admit this and will blame his failures on government interference. 

**IV. Technological Advancements in the Supply Chain**

 The ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry has witnessed a surge in investments and strategic partnerships, indicating the growing interest and confidence in this sector. Established automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively pursuing collaborations to leverage their respective expertise and accelerate the development and commercialization of ADAS and autonomous vehicles. 

ADAS = Chipmakers + Real Time Operating System + Automotive Cloud + Sensors + Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 

*Chipmakers:*

* Mobileye (Spun off, but still controlled, by Intel)
* Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion Platform
* Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Flex Soc

*Real Time Operating System (RTOS):*

* BlackBerry QNX already has deals with automotive OEMs to offer them their RTOS.

*Automotive Cloud:*

* Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (powered Microsoft Azure)
* Blackberry IVY (powered by Amazon AWS)

*Sensors:*

* Microvision (LiDAR) - Most likely, all AVs that offer level 3 ADAS and above will need to be equipped with a lidar sensor. The LiDAR sector has consolidated, and MVIS aims to take over 50% of the automotive market. MVIS shareholders just authorized an additional 100 million shares. Currently, a major squeeze is being anticipated. Get in while you can!

*Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:*

* ADAS is going to be a major revenue stream for automotive OEMs. Most likely, will be a subscription-based model.
* All the automotive OEMs have their own version. The race to offer Level 3 and above is currently underway. Here are a few examples:
* Autopilot by Tesla
* Bluecruise by Ford
* Super Cruise by GM
* Subaru Eyesight
* Honda Automated Drive
* Mercedes Drive Pilot (level 3)
* ETC...

**V. Conclusion**

When considering investment opportunities in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle sector, it is essential to identify companies that demonstrate technological leadership, strong partnerships, and a clear roadmap for future growth. These companies are likely to be at the forefront of innovation and well-positioned to capitalize on the market trends and evolving consumer demands.

In conclusion, the ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry is witnessing a transformative phase characterized by increased investment and strategic partnerships. Automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to advance technology, share resources, and accelerate the market adoption of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.

Positions: $EOSE - 304,298 shares https://www.reddit.com/user/mpwrd/comments/14k39tl/eose_position/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

EOS Energy (Ticker $EOSE) is probably the most exciting opportunity I have come across since going balls deep into TSLA during the COVID meltdown. I‚Äôm going to lay out exactly why I‚Äôve built up a 7 figure position in the stock. I have been itching to share this DD on WSB and watching the market cap like a hawk so that I can finally post this DD when EOSE breaks the $500 million market cap requirement.

EOS Energy is grid-scale battery manufacturing company that builds long duration energy storage batteries. It builds zinc-bromide batteries, which, unlike lithium ion counterparts, have virtually zero fire risk using significantly cheaper and more available raw materials inputs that can all be sourced within the USA. EOS is based in New Jersey and its main manufacturing facility is located in Turtle Creek, PA. It went public via a SPAC in 2020. Significant investors include Point72 (Steven A Cohen), The Koch family (which own convertible notes), Vanguard, and Legal & General Group PLC.

THIS IS A SHITTY SPAC THAT IS TEETERING ON BANKRUPTCY

Let‚Äôs get the bad out of the way: as of Dec 31, 2022, the company (a former de-SPAC flameout) was roughly 2 quarters away from bankruptcy based on cash burn and money in the bank. In Q1, they managed to avoid barreling towards bankruptcy only through the magic of massive dilution.

Second bad point - EOS raised that money from some of the absolute worst sources of capital available to shitty public companies: an alternative lender (read: loan shark) named Yorkville Advisors. Yorkville finances EOS through a secondary equity purchase agreement (SEPA), which allows EOS to raise debt at will from Yorkville. The problem is that Yorkville can, at any time, call that note and force EOS to issue shares to Yorkville to pay off the note at a discount to the lowest daily average over the past 5 or so days. Yorkville then dumps the shares on the public market causing intraday swings of 10% or more. I suspect Yorkville is actually shorting the shares in advance of acquiring the shares, using the worst trading methods possible to depress the share price as much as quickly as possible, then covering using the SEPA. Yorkville gets all of its shares under the SEPA at the lowest intraday average price, so the bigger the delta between when it starts selling and the lowest price, the more Yorkville makes. 

This is the biggest risk in the near term for EOS: that it will need to raise more capital tanking the stock leaving us as bag holders. But we have help on the way: enter Jigar Shah, the head of the Department of Energy Loan Program Office who is making it rain on green tech companies to the tune of $400 BILLION. 

HERES THE GOOD NEWS: ITS GOING TO GET A HUGE, CHEAP DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TITLE 17 LOAN

The Department of Energy‚Äôs Loan Program Office is about to swoop in and provide a minimum of $250 million dollars of financing, which is an immediate catalyst to sending EOS to the fuckin moon. EOS has been pursuing this loan for over a year and everything points to an imminent approval of the loan for the following reasons:

1 - EOS is the only major player in the non-lithium ion grid-scale battery pack - a major focus of influential senators including none other than Joe Manchin, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/2/manchin-bipartisan-colleagues-urge-administration-to-invest-in-non-lithium-energy-storage-solutions

2 - EOS sources over 90% of its materials for its batteries from the United States (this also helps it qualify for additional tax credits under the IRA which we‚Äôll talk about below). https://www.eose.com/technology/ 

3 - EOS estimates that the loan will help it generate 700 new jobs in a key battleground state for the upcoming elections, Pennsylvania, where its main manufacturing facility is located.

4 - At an investor conference on Jun 9, 2023, the CEO said this about how the loan is progressing: ‚ÄúEos is in the final innings with the process and has solidified most of the commercial terms. The company‚Äôs attorneys are working through the final punch list of items after which it will be submitted for Treasury final review. That review process should be completed within 30 days of submission and if approved will be followed by an official announcement.

Oh, and by the way, @jigarshah tweeted (in a subsequently deleted tweet) on April 1 that ‚ÄúMany announcements are coming to Pittsburgh and the Ohio River Valley‚Äù. 

If EOS gets the loan, this would completely remove bankruptcy risk priced at 10-year treasury plus a slight risk premium, making the company fully investable for investment funds looking for exposure to the only US based non lithium storage company delivering commercially deployed batteries. 

EOS IS A HUGE BENEFICIARY OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT

Eos gets incredible benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act hitting all sides of the income statement. Energy storage installations are eligible for the following IRA benefits, of which Eos can qualify for every single one:

1 - a 30% investment tax credit to the buyer for installation of energy storage
2 - a 10% tax credit to the buyer for domestic content
3 - a 10% tax credit for installation of the storage in an energy transition zone.
4 - EOS gets a $35/kWh production tax credit for cell manufacturing
5 - EOS also gets a $10/kWh production tax credit for domestic battery module assembly
6 - Finally, a 10% qualifying tax credit for active electrode material costs.

THERE IS NEAR INFINITE DEMAND FOR ENERGY STORAGE

As of Dec 2022, EOS had an order backlog for committed orders of $535M. A lot of orders were sitting on the side lines waiting for guidance on domestic content for the 10% additional tax credit mentioned above and the company is currently projecting for $1B of new booked orders for 2023. This translates to roughly 6 GWh of backlog.  

On a longer timescale, the company had another $1.5 billion of LOIs, another $7 billion of active proposals, and $10 billion of lead generation available to be converted to loans. Look for another LDES provider at scale - there aren‚Äôt any. The only competitors are Tesla and Fluence that sell Lithium Ion grid batteries at about twice the cost of Eos.  https://investors.eose.com/static-files/589460b5-8001-4a76-b06b-2e2880968f98 

EOS BATTERY ECONOMICS ARE TURNING A CORNER

In Q1, Eos produced the last of its hand-made second generation battery. Q2 will be dedicated to transitioning to a semi automated production line that will significantly improve economics and scale and Q3-Q4 will be all about the ramp. 

Eos touts the following improvements between Z2 and Z3 batteries:

1 - 15% immediate improvement in cost structure with another 15%-35% gained by deploying automation that has already been ordered.
2 - cycle times for production vastly decreased resulting in 9x battery output.
3 - Q1 2022 to Q1 2023 has already seen a 24% decrease in CoGS during which time revenue increased by 168% on an absolute basis (NOT PER UNIT).

The company has already put down payments on long lead time items critical to manufacturing the Z3 batteries.

Eos doesn‚Äôt talk about its ultimate target cost per kWh, but its main competitor, Redflow, a tiny even earlier stage zinc based battery company based out of Australia that doesn‚Äôt get the benefit of the inflation reduction act hopes to achieve a $100 per kWh COGS.

EOS HAS SIGNIFICANT BAKED IN VALUE

Eos is projecting for approximately 6 GWh of backlog at the end of 2023, which results in $270 million of production tax credits which will be paid to the company.

On top of that, Eos, being a shitty SPAC, has significant net operating loss carry forwards, which can be used to offset future net income (similar to all the people who post loss porn on WSB, but with an actual chance to make money going forward and recapture that value). As of December 2022, it was sitting on $485 million of NOL Carry Forwards. In Q1 2023, it lost another $71 million. If you estimate another $100 million of NOL in 2023 * a 21% corporate tax rate, that‚Äôs approximately $135 million of value to EOS.

Together with the production tax credits, there are about $400 million in value of tax benefits, or about 80% of its current market cap.
