0,Tesla faces a $7.5 billion ultimatum: Open up its charging network to rivals or be locked out...,5811,1117dd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1117dd2/tesla_faces_a_75_billion_ultimatum_open_up_its/,959,1676292293.0,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/tesla-faces-a-7-5-billion-ultimatum-open-up-its-charging-network-to-rivals-or-be-locked-out-of-biden-s-ev-subsidies-report-says/ar-AA17qumN?cvid=ba9b99dea7ee4da08fe347d443676af9)

 New US requirements will put Tesla under pressure to open up its EV charging network to rivals, per Reuters.

* If it doesn't, it could miss out on getting in on the $7.5 billion in charger subsidies planned by Biden.
* Tesla's 40,000+ EV chargers can only be used by its cars, but officials told Reuters that could change.

 

Tesla could find itself locked out of $7.5 billion in Biden administration subsidies if it fails to open its EV charging network up to competitors, according to a Reuters report.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

Musk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally."

3,Was the TWTR bid by Elon just a way to hide a massive sale of TSLA Stock?,3839,vxi1zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vxi1zm/was_the_twtr_bid_by_elon_just_a_way_to_hide_a/,748,1657650514.0,"Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a ""massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses"" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.

I'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).

I'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).

One comment in particular really seems to confirm the above suspicion:

4,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,3445,12s8m77,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12s8m77/tesla_net_income_and_earnings_drop_more_than_20/,889,1681935275.0,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed Tesla from its top stock list.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.

When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, ""It does not.""

Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. ""


What do you guys make of all this? Is everyone still permabullsih on Tesla or are the tides turning against them? Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.

Personally I don't want to touch anything this man is involved with and haven't done so for a good year now, and that seems to be working pretty well. Kudos to anyone who's been making bank swing trading Tesla though and good luck to those who believe in the company long term. I wish I could, but I just don't trust them."

His advice to me was to invest everything into QQQ.

If I wanted to spread my money out between Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Ford, etc, aren’t I better off just investing in QQQ?"
10,Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,2382,12ekzkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ekzkx/tesla_cuts_us_prices_for_fifth_time_since_january/,869,1680873337.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is selling millions of Tesla shares again. The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.

In April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.

Musk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.

Tesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.

12,Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,2352,13rxgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13rxgz6/cathie_woods_ark_invest_sold_most_of_its_nvidia/,405,1685058945.0,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

Palantir’s boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if “such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.” Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that “many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.”

He added, without naming anyone, that this is because “people who have nothing to offer want to study AI,” but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, “studying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield” is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an “A.I. race” akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that “there is already an A.I. arms race, it’s just we’re ahead, [and] it’s not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.”

He pointed out that the “single most important event” in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir’s AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield “just throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,” Karp said. He added, “especially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There’s only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.”"
14,Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.,2081,ytlgev,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ytlgev/tesla_officially_makes_its_charging_standard/,311,1668295064.0,"Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.

Tesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”

The charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.

Tesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.

Tesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.

However, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.

The company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.

If automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks.

Twitter's stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This comes a day after Elon Musk completed [the company's takeover after a lengthy ordeal](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) late Thursday. Incidentally, the delisting is taking place on the same date as the U.S. midterm elections.

""The New York Stock Exchange hereby notifies the SEC of its intention to remove the entire class of the stated securities from listing and registration on the Exchange at the opening of business on November 08, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2 (a),"" the [filing reads](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/876661/000087666122000890/0000876661-22-000890.txt).

It also indicated that [the merger](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) between Twitter and Musk's subsidiary X Holdings II, Inc. was complete. Musk's X Holdings I, Inc. will now own all the stock of the social network.

""The merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Elon R. Musk became effective on October 27, 2022. Each share of Twitter, Inc. Common Stock was exchanged for USD 54.20 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Exchange also notifies the Securities and Exchange Commission that as a result of the above-indicated conditions this security was suspended from trading before market open on October 28, 2022.""

At the time of writing, Twitter's stock was trading at $53.70 — slightly lower than Musk's buying price of $54.20. Twitter won't have to make quarterly disclosures like its monthly active users or its earnings as a private company. But financial institutions that have lent money to Musk will pressure the billionaire to make the company profitable.

The social media company will likely form a new board after the current members will dissolve.

Tesla had exaggerated the “driving ranges of its cars on a single charge, their fuel cost-effectiveness compared to gasoline vehicles as well as the performance of its Superchargers” on its official local website since August 2019 until recently.

The driving range of the U.S. EV manufacturer’s cars plunge in cold weather by up to 50.5% versus how they are advertised online, the KFTC said in a statement on Tuesday.

17,Parted with TSLA this week after holding for 5 years. Here's why.,1965,ztzzhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ztzzhp/parted_with_tsla_this_week_after_holding_for_5/,384,1671850615.0,"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.

Being a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' 

However, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole ""but Elon isn't Tesla!"" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. 

I do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think ""Tesla"" you cannot escape thinking ""Elon Musk."" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. 

Now, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. 

A mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: ""Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."" 

Where is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?

Often times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how ""dumb"" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  

The sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. 

I'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to <$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.

My thoughts on being a TSLA investor is what my mother used to say: it's been real, it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun."
18,Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,1915,12u12hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12u12hf/ford_ceo_jim_farley_says_tesla_price_cuts_could/,584,1682082204.0,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Representatives for Tesla and Ford did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours."

Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found

Thousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.

A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.

The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.

The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.


Among the Journal’s findings:

• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.

• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.

• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.

• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.

• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.

Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.

He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”

Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”

Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.

Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.

This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.

A view of Washington, D.C.

Most officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.

Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)

Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.

Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.

At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.

Mr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.

In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.

Reported trades in energy and mining firms;

made by spouse through a financial adviser

The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.

Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.

In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.

In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.

In about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.

In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.

Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.

After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”

Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.

U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.

The EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.

Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.

Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.

Mr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.

In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.

Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”

The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.

“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”

He said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.

Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.

The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.

An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.

Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.

Mr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.

The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.

They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.

After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.

An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.

“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.

When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.

Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.

Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.

Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.

The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.

At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.

In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.

Because Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.

In early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.

It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.

Ms. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.

The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.

The new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.

Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”

Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.

The Federal Reserve building in Washington.

Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.

In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.

The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.

About one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.

Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.

Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.

Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”

Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”

The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.

Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.

Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.

Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.

Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.

Three days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.

The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.

In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.

The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.

At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.

When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.

A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.

One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.

When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.

The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”

Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.

Most federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.

The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.

At the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.

The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.

When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.

His “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.

In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.

Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”

Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.

“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”

The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.

“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”

Ethics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.

On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.

Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed."

Then, Elon will dump again. If the recession ends quicker, he will dump sooner. 

Every bubble eventually bursts. 

It's not a matter of IF he will dump, it's a matter of WHEN.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday he does not plan to sell any more shares of Tesla for at least the next two years, after the billionaire and nascent Twitter owner offloaded nearly $3.6 billion worth of stock this week as Tesla's share price tumbled.

Musk said during a Twitter Spaces audio call he will stop offloading Tesla stock after selling nearly $40 billion worth of it in the past year.

Tesla's share price dropped nearly 9% Thursday to close at $125.35, as investors grow increasingly concerned about demand for the company’s electric vehicles and leery of the massive amount of time Musk is devoting to running Twitter.

The drop put Tesla nearly 70% of its all-time high in January, when the stock at its peak traded above $400 and Tesla's market capitalization swelled to $1.2 trillion—pushing Musk’s net worth, which is mostly made up of Tesla shares, above $300 billion."
23,Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk’s Focus on Twitter,1650,zlf435,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlf435/tesla_investors_voice_concern_over_elon_musks/,492,1670985601.0,"The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk‘s involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company’s stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  

“There is no TSLA CEO today,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. 

Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla’s stock Monday. Shares in the world’s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company’s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.

Mr. Black said, “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”

Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla’s board of directors. “Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,” Mr. Gerber said. 

He separately tweeted, “There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon’s plans are.”

Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,” he testified. 

Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday’s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla’s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world’s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla’s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.

The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer details.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. “I continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,” he tweeted Saturday.

Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk’s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company’s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn’t be the case.

Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: “Tesla board is missing in action” and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. 

Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn’t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. 

Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

24,Toyota Chief Says ‘Silent Majority’ Has Doubts About Pursuing Only EVs,1628,zpgxoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zpgxoj/toyota_chief_says_silent_majority_has_doubts/,758,1671421269.0,"BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.

Auto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.

Still, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.

“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”

While major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.

The world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.

“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.

Global car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.

Traditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.

At the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.

And their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.

The infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.

According to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.

But that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.

Auto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.

“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.

Ryan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.

That might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.

Mr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.

Mazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.

Nissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.

The wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.

Mr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.

Mr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.

Toyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.

Mr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.

The Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.

“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.

 Aug 23 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) misled federal regulators about its defenses against hackers and spam accounts, CNN and the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing whistleblower disclosures by the social media company's former security chief Peiter Zatko.

In an 84-page complaint, Zatko, a famed hacker more widely known as ""Mudge"", alleged Twitter falsely claimed it had a solid security plan and said he had warned colleagues that half the company's servers were running out-of-date and vulnerable software, according to the reports.

27,Tesla EV deliveries fall nearly 18% in second quarter following China factory shutdown,1469,vq33ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vq33ui/tesla_ev_deliveries_fall_nearly_18_in_second/,882,1656801605.0,"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/02/tesla-ev-deliveries-fall-nearly-18-in-second-quarter-following-china-factory-shutdown/

Tesla delivered 254,695 electric vehicles globally in the second quarter, a nearly 18% drop from the previous period as supply chain constraints, China’s extended COVID-19 lockdown and challenges around opening factories in Berlin and Austin took their toll on the company. This is the first time in two years that Tesla deliveries, which were 310,048 in the first period this year, have fallen quarter over quarter. Tesla deliveries were up 26.5% from the second quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter reduction is in line with a broader supply chain problem in the industry. It also illustrates the importance of Tesla’s Shanghai factory to its business. Tesla shuttered its Shanghai factory multiple times in March due to rising COVID-19 cases that prompted a government shutdown.

The company said Saturday it produced 258,580 EVs, a 15% reduction from the previous quarter when it made 305,407 vehicles. Like in other quarters over the past two years, most of the produced and delivered vehicles were Model 3 and Model Ys. Only 16,411 of the produced vehicles were the older Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla said in its released that June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in Tesla’s history. Despite that milestone, the EV maker as well as other companies in the industry, have struggled to keep apace with demand as supply chain problems persist."
28,My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?,1389,11lzm6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11lzm6c/my_58yearold_father_put_his_entire_401k_into/,776,1678290244.0,"Hi Reddit!

I've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.

For background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as ""robo-taxis"" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.

Setting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund (""all your eggs are in one basket""), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.

My fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.

Some questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:

If you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?

If you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?

How would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?

What should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?

What resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?

It's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.

Thanks so much!  


EDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.  I think he is up now on original investment, but down on most continued contributions."

Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/apple-carplay-could-be-a-trojan-horse-into-the-automotive-industry.html) where I found this stat:

* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.

* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.

* GM, which wasn’t listed on Apple’s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. 

* Tesla, which doesn’t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its “FSD” driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.

* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple’s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.

* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car’s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.

This sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:

* iPhone obviously.
* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.
* Apple home IOT networks.
* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.

While this is all exciting, that 79% sounds very inflated. For those of you looking to buy new cars, is having CarPlay really that big of a criteria when you consider your next vehicle?

*Disclosure I own a lot of Apple.*"

The Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter CEO was sued by Tesla shareholders over a series of tweets he wrote in Aug. 2018 saying he had “funding secured” to take the automaker private for $420 per share, and that “investor support” for such a deal was “confirmed.” Trading in Tesla was halted after his tweets, and its share price remained volatile for weeks.

He doesn’t think ahead of time in that rushed moment that this could be interpreted differently and what it means to him,” Musk’s attorney told the jury earlier on Friday. “In that moment he didn’t think, ‘how could my words be interpreted differently by you than it means to me.’”

“You have to assess this in context – he’s considering taking it private and the issue is will it actually take it forward,” Musk’s attorney said. “No fraud has ever been built on the back of a consideration.”

The shareholders in the certified class action lawsuit include a mix of stock and options buyers who allege that Musk’s tweets were reckless and false, and that relying on his statements to make decisions about when to buy or sell cost them significant amounts of money.

Musk later claimed that he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, and thought funding would come through at his proposed price based on a handshake. However, the deal never materialized.

During the course of this trial, Musk also said he would have sold shares of SpaceX to finance a going private deal for Tesla, as well as taking funds from the Saudi PIF.

35,Tesla stock falls more than 5% after hours as Investor Day falls short on detail,1123,11frmg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11frmg2/tesla_stock_falls_more_than_5_after_hours_as/,410,1677727906.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html

Electric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his “Master Plan 3,” and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.

The presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.

Near the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, “There is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn’t require destroying natural habitats. It doesn’t require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.” He added, “In fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.”

Musk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in “re-powering the grid with renewable fuels” as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla’s electric vehicles and for the company’s utility-scale energy storage systems.

Tesla’s goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.

During a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.

Elon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. “As long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don’t have to worry about demand,” Zhu said. “We try everything to cut costs,” he added, “and pass down that value to our customers.”

Musk then added, “Demand is a function of affordability not desire.” He said, “Even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.”

Zhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.

“It took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,” Zhu said touting the company’s improving operational efficiency.

He said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.

Tesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company’s Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.

Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its “next gen” vehicle.

The company’s powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla’s next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.

Ahead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.

Musk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.

Tesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.

Mizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, “Near-term, we see continued strength in TSLA’s market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA’s share of the US EV market.”

Currently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.

Musk’s ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:

“Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage”

“Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments”

“Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning”

“Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it”."
36,Cathie Wood's Main ETF Closes at Five-Year Low in 78% Drop From Record,1112,y4c7sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y4c7sv/cathie_woods_main_etf_closes_at_fiveyear_low_in/,304,1665800914.0,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship fund on Friday closed at its lowest level in five years, after suffering a 78% plunge from last year’s highs.

The ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) dropped 5.7%, finishing the day at $33.99 per share. The fund fell roughly 9.4% over the five-day stretch, its fifth straight weekly decline. 

“Nothing has changed in the larger macro backdrop -- a strong dollar is pressuring risk assets, inflation keeps surprising on the upside, rates are sticky and the Fed has to keep tightening,” said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Securities. “All of that is a bad combo for high-growth stocks.”

The year hasn’t been kind to the $6.7 billion ETF, as top holdings like Tesla Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were pummeled. Growth-oriented assets, like tech stocks or retail-trading favorite Tesla, have tanked as the Federal Reserve raises rates to knock down scorching levels of inflation. 

Wood took the central bank to task this week for its aggressive tightening campaign, penning an open letter to officials to express concern that they could be making a policy error. 

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Wood said the current risk-off environment means investors are looking for safety in passive benchmark-tracking products and failing to recognize that her fund’s investments are positioned for the long haul. Wood and her firm have often said they are focused on at least a five-year investment horizon.

Wood’s other funds have also been battered this year, with most dropping 40% or more. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) dropped 5.1% on Friday and closed at a record low.

Tesla has for years delivered big batches of vehicles toward the end of each quarter, a practice Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried to move away from by localizing production in all major regions. While the carmaker opened its first European factory in Germany in March, record shipping costs are still bedeviling the auto industry along with shortages of semiconductors and other components.

38,"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks",971,14df4ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14df4ri/berlin_intel_strike_deal_on_33_billion_chip_plant/,193,1687182379.0,"BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.  
  
The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.  
  
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".  
  
Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).  
  
The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.  
  
Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.  
  
The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.  
  
Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.  
  
Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.  
  
The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  
  
It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.  
  
Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.  
  
""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.  


Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.  
  
  
Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  
It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  
With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  
""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted.  
There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  
Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  
""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote.  
With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.

  
Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  
But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  
The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%."

* Interpret the tone and sentiment of Fed officials and central bankers and gauge their policy stance
* Extract key information from earnings reports and company announcements and assess their impact on stock prices
* Generate natural language summaries of complex financial data and trends
* Answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises

The article also mentions some examples of how ChatGPT performed on some recent headlines and statements, such as:

* “Fed Chair Powell says economy is at an ‘inflection point’ with stronger growth ahead”
* “Tesla reports record deliveries of 184,800 vehicles in Q1 2023”
* “GameStop announces $1 billion stock sale plan”

ChatGPT gave some interesting responses, such as:

* “Powell’s statement suggests that he is optimistic about the economic recovery and expects inflation to remain under control. This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.”
* “Tesla’s delivery numbers exceeded analysts’ expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla’s stock price could rise on this positive news.”
* “GameStop’s stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop’s stock price could drop on this announcement.”

I think this is a fascinating application of AI and NLP to the financial domain, and I wonder how accurate and reliable ChatGPT can be in its predictions. Do you think it could be a useful tool for investors and traders?

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

It's not really what I imagined the ratings were based on. It's seems too easy for firms to be ""Ethical"" based on ticking some management boxes rather than what they actually do as a business. Surely it should be on the activity of the business and not to do with whether they fly the pride flag (for example)?

Tesla CEO cites not enough information from Twitter on 'fake or spam accounts'

Elon Musk's tumultuous $44 billion US bid to buy Twitter is on the verge of collapse after the Tesla CEO sent a letter to Twitter's board saying he is terminating the acquisition.

The chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, tweeted Friday that the board is ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.""

Twitter could have pushed for a $1 billion US breakup fee Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight over the deal, which the company's board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.


The possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world's richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms.

Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 95 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.

What Elon Musk's Twitter feed says about how he might run the company
On Friday, shares of Twitter fell five per cent to $36.81 US, well below the $54.20 US that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5 per cent to $752.29 US.

In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk said Twitter has ""not complied with its contractual obligations"" surrounding the deal, namely giving Musk enough information to ""make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform.""

Major shareholder

Musk's flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That's when Twitter has said he contacted members of its board — including co-founder Jack Dorsey — and told them he was buying up shares of the company and interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor.

Then, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company's largest shareholder after acquiring a nine per cent stake worth about $3 billion US.

At first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted that Musk would not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.

Elon Musk’s Twitter deal prompts free speech debate

Calling himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover deal is reigniting the debate around freedom of speech on social media platforms. Some fear that under Musk’s ownership, Twitter could be exploited as a platform to spread disinformation and monitor critics.
Musk had agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 US per share, inserting a ""420"" marijuana reference into his offer price.

He sold roughly $8.5 billion US worth of shares in Tesla to help fund the purchase, then strengthened his commitments of more than $7 billion US from a diverse group of investors including Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

Elon Musk threatens to abandon bid to buy Twitter over fake account problem
Inside Twitter, Musk's offer was met with confusion and falling morale, especially after Musk publicly criticized one of Twitter's top lawyers involved in content-moderation decisions.

As Twitter executives prepared for the deal to move forward, the company instituted a hiring freeze, halted discretionary spending and fired two top managers. The San Francisco company has also been laying off staff, most recently part of its talent acquisition team."
50,WSJ - S&P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,650,144ptye,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/144ptye/wsj_sp_500_ends_longest_bear_market_since_the/,273,1686269629.0,"U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500’s longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. 

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.

Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday. 

That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.

So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. 

“A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. 

Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.

GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. 

U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.

Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.

This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.

This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.

We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's ""Investor Day,"" where he'll outline his ""Master Plan Part Three.""

52,Tesla Semi doubts,632,za7o0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/za7o0i/tesla_semi_doubts/,773,1669946246.0,"Tesla Semi *delivery* event has happened, the first delivery actually happened yesterday to Pepsi. 

500 mile range at 82,000 lbs real world test. Right off the factory line, onto the road. There was no aero package added and no weight change, and the truck only stopped once so the driver could use the bathroom. 

During this real world test, brakes were actually cold at the mandatory brake check on route. Which is in place so drivers that normally would have extremely hot brakes don’t end up experiencing brake failures due to high temperatures. This is because the regenerative brake system on the Tesla semi works extremely well, to the point where the brakes are almost not needed. Think of it kind of like an engine brake on a diesel truck, but instead of just slowing down the truck it now also charges the battery. 

Price was not discussed, weight was not discussed. 

It’s clear that this will operate extremely well on shorter routes with its current range, but will not be as useful on larger trips. The argument can be made that laws don’t allow drivers to drive continuously without breaks, but the Semi is still a little short even with these breaks accounted for. I imagine as battery density gets better this will change. Along with the fact that these electric semi (on paper) will be *far* cheaper to operate, possibly offsetting downtime (charging time) costs. 

Over the average lifetime of a Semi, Tesla semi can save $600k to a million+ just in fuel. (Depending on charging rates) That doesn’t account for possible (and highly likely) maintenance cost savings. 

TLDR: Tesla Semi is a beast and obvious choice for anything under the ~500 mile routes, as routes get longer more consideration will be needed. 

Also to all the doubters, Tesla may be late, wrong, or seem completely insane sometimes but I think it’s fair to say that they do deliver."
53,Morgan Stanley: Treat Tesla like it's a Chinese tech stock until at least 2030 because of how much profit it makes there(50%).

* **Up to half of the Elon Musk-run EV maker's profitability comes from China sales, the bank said.**
* **Tesla and Chinese tech stocks have both fallen sharply this year as recession fears intensify**

**Tesla rakes in so much of its profits from Chinese sales that it will behave like a tech stock listed on Hong Kong's Hang Seng or the Shanghai Composite index until at least 2030**, according to Morgan Stanley.

The electric carmaker is likely to find itself closely tethered to the price movements of China's tech stocks because up to half of its profits come from that country, its analysts said in a Monday research note.

""**We estimate Tesla generates as much as one-half of its profitability from the Chinese market, arguably making the stock a derivative of a Chinese tech stock,**"" the team led by equity analyst Adam Jonas said.

Tesla's reliance on sales to China makes it vulnerable to a rise in geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, Morgan Stanley said.

Recently, Musk was praised by Chinese government officials for suggesting that Taiwan — a flashpoint in tensions with the US — should become a special administrative zone like Hong Kong.

Tesla will likely be reliant on its sales in China until at least 2030, the Morgan Stanley team said. That leaves it exposed, if the hostilities between the US and China intensify.

""The broader arc of Sino-US economic relations and the evolving geopolitical situation will continue to add volatility to Tesla shares,"" the bank said.

""Our forecasts through 2030 become gradually less China-dependent, but this takes time.""

Berkshire initial investment is now “worth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That’s a pretty good rate of return,” said Warren Buffett’s longtime investment partner.

BYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.

“At the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It’s not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it’s a very remarkable company,” Munger said.

Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.

Asked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.

“Tesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it’s almost ridiculous,” Munger said.

BYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.

“BYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China. It’s incredible what’s happened,” Munger said. “If you count all the manufacturing space they have in China to make cars, it would amount to a big percentage of the Manhattan island, and nobody had ever heard of them a few years ago.”

The longtime investor called Tesla CEO Elon Musk talented — and peculiar. He previously said what Musk achieved in the car business was a “minor miracle.”

“I don’t buy him, and I don’t short him,” Munger said Wednesday."

Robinhood Markets is launching an index to track the favorite stocks of its millions of predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. The brokerage firm’s new “Robinhood Investor Index” will track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. Initially, the top five stocks in the index will be Tesla , Apple, Amazon.com, Ford Motor and meme-stock favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings. Robinhood said it would update the composition of the index monthly, offering a view into its customers’ changing tastes. In an unusual approach to constructing an index, Robinhood said it would weight stocks in the index by the “conviction” customers have in them, defined as the percentage of assets in a customer's portfolio devoted to a particular stock. 

That means that if many Robinhood users devote a large part of their portfolio to one stock, it would rank higher in the index, even if those users' holdings were relatively small. Robinhood tends to have less-affluent customers, with smaller accounts, than other brokerages.

Robinhood has experimented with sharing such data before. During the early months of the pandemic, it released hourly data on the popularity of stocks among its customers, which were aggregated by the third-party website Robintrack.net. The site became a popular way to track retail-investor activity until Robinhood shut off the data feed in August 2020, citing concerns that its data could be “misconstrued or misunderstood.”"

* Musk liquidates billions in stock to buy Twitter
* Elon saying that he will sell BILLIONS MORE stock in 2025 or sooner
* Fed raising interest rates will hurt auto industry as a whole
* Tesla has a few more factories, Germany can't hire anyone due to uncompetitive compensation compared to other German auto makers, while Tesla is planning layoffs in US factories and temporary shutdown in China
* Elon thinks supporting alt-right will suddenly become environmentalists and embrace EV's instead of their redneck coal-rollers
* Elon thinks supporting Republicans will get him more EV support programs from Congress
* Consumer Reports rating Tesla as WORST in build quality (at a time when...)
* Legacy automakers catching up (Hyundai EV just won highest 5 star safety rating European standards) and have decades of established quality manufacturing standards
* Unpredictable Russia Ukraine war
* Higher labor costs
* Higher raw materials costs
* Chip shortage
* Higher logistics costs
* Musk alienating his first to adopt audience turning them against Tesla causing enough decline in demand that even $7500 off sale and 3x markdowns in China can't fix
* Tesla opened up charging network to nab some capital from government grants but shooting themselves in the foot at the same time
* A little thing called GLOBAL RECESSION

57,"Tesla recalls 362,758 vehicles, says full self-driving beta software may cause crashes",549,113xc3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/113xc3n/tesla_recalls_362758_vehicles_says_full/,212,1676571941.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html

Tesla said Thursday it’s recalling “certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation.” The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.

The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: “act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,” according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately “to changes in posted speed limits,” the notice said.

The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.

Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second — despite the brand name.

Only Tesla owners who have the company’s premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main attraction is “autosteer on city streets,” which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban environments automatically, if imperfectly."

Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

  
Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  
Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.  
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""Nonetheless it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck’s capabilities.  
Preproduction “alpha” versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still “astounded” that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.  
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.

On Sunday, the Tesla chief executive congratulated the company’s Shanghai “gigafactory” in a tweet: “Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.”

The milestone came just a few weeks after Musk said Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., produced its 2 millionth vehicle. Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as “money furnaces.” The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. 

When earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in “supply-chain hell for several years,” but barring a surprise, “we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.” 

In that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved “the highest vehicle production month in our history” in June. Tesla shares TSLA, +4.68% have rallied 25% over the past month, as it gets set for a 3-for-1 stock split Aug. 24, but they are still down about 15% year to date, compared to the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.73% 10% decline this year."

Ford Motor will partner with Tesla on several charging initiatives for its current and future electric vehicles in an unusual tie-up between the two rivals, CEOs of the automakers announced Thursday.

The deal includes current Ford owners being granted access to 50% of Tesla’s coveted Supercharger network, followed by Ford’s next-generation of EVs that are expected by mid-decade to include Tesla’s charging plug. The design will allow owners of the vehicles to charge at Tesla superchargers without an adaptor, making Ford the first to do so.

The initiatives were announced by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a live, audio discussion on Twitter, which Musk currently leads. The CEOs announced the surprise discussion earlier in the afternoon."

Earnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv

In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.

Tesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.

Last year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.

So far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.

Tesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.

Among other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.

Throughout the fourth quarter of 2022, shareholders also sought answers from Tesla and Elon Musk about his intentions at the automaker as the price of Tesla shares declined. Tesla’s share price has dropped more than 40% over the past six months. 

Musk is currently splitting his time, attention and resources between Tesla, SpaceX, the defense contractor where he is CEO, and Twitter, the social media business he recently acquired.

The celebrity CEO sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings last year, including $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, in part to finance the Twitter deal, which closed in late October 2022. He immediately appointed himself “Chief Twit,” and CEO there.

Since taking over Twitter, he has made sweeping changes to the business and the service, including allowing people who had been permanently suspended from the platform to come back online.

Musk’s moves at Twitter, and his political statements on the social media platform, have correlated with a sharp decline in Musk’s and Tesla’s reputation, especially among liberal- to very liberal-leaning people in the US, according to research by YouGov shared with CNBC.

While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.

**Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.** 

Tesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

# Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles

The Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.

Vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit. 

**Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**

# The Eligibility Switch

Late Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change ""implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.

""Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership. 

Jonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries. 

Or, Jonas said, it simply could be ""regulatory semantics."" Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery."

I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).

So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:

1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.

2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)

Do you have any similar examples?"

Tesla on Sunday posted its first-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2023.

Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:

Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875

Total production Q1 2023: 440,808

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.

The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.

The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.

Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.

The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks. 

Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,” the company wrote in a statement Sunday.

Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.

The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.

According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.

The independent researcher who publishes under the handle TroyTeslike was expecting deliveries of 427,000 and production totaling 445,920 vehicles.

The first quarter of 2023 was marked by repeated price cuts by Tesla including in the U.S., Europe and China.

Tesla’s moves sparked a so-called “price war” in EVs, and posed a challenge to competitors including Ford and General Motors who are trying to gain marketshare in the fully electric vehicle segment domestically.

Tesla shares rose more than 60% in the first quarter to close at $207.46 on Friday ahead of the production and deliveries report. (They closed at $123.18 on December 30th, the last day of trading in 2022.)"

Tesla has cut prices on its top-selling electric vehicles in the United States and Germany, the automaker's website showed, extending a new strategy of aggressive discounting after missing Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter deliveries.

The U.S. price cuts, announced late Thursday in U.S. time on the Model 3 and Model Y, ranged between 6% and 20% compared with the prices that held before the discount, according to a Reuters calculation.

That is before accounting for a $7,500 federal tax credit that took effect for many electric vehicle models at the start of January.

In Germany, Tesla cut prices on the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover - its global top-seller - by between about 1% and amost 17% depending on the configuration.

For a U.S. buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the U.S. subsidy that took effect this month amounts to a discount of 31%.

Taken together with price cuts announced last week in China and other Asian markets, the move marked a reversal in Tesla's largest markets from the strategy it had pursued through much of 2022 when demand was strong and average sale prices for its electric vehicles had been trending higher.

The shift is the first major move by Tesla since appointing its lead executive for China and Asia, Tom Zhu, to oversee global output and sales after falling short of its 2022 delivery target.

Tesla cut prices in China and other Asian markets last week. Along with a previous price cuts announced in October and recent incentives, the China price for a Model 3 or Model Y was down 13% to 24% from September after the recent move, Reuters calculations showed.

Tesla has also cut prices in South Korea, Japan, Australia and Singapore.

Analysts had said the China price cuts would boost demand and deepen the pressure for its rivals there, including BYD to follow suit in what could become a price war in the largest single market for electric vehicles.

Tesla's main market is the United States, and its second largest market is China.

Tesla missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter deliveries.

Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said ""radical interest rate changes"" had changed the industry-wide outlook and that Tesla could lower pricing to sustain volume growth, which would result in lower profit."

Seriously though, is Musk+Twitter a good or bad combination?
And now that Musk is overpaying for Twitter, based on what he said during Tesla’s ER, wouldn’t all of that trickle through to Tesla’s shareholders as well?
And why didn’t Musk look into buying out Snap for example instead of the highly controversial Twitter? He can easily mold several of the less controversial platforms out there which have lower valuations and a high number of adopters.

Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again?

People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this ""overvalued"" in my life. What is keeping it up?"

**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) investors are growing tired of Elon Musk's Twitter fiasco. And for good reason.

The 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

It cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.

## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock

Tesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.

That's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.

Investors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.

Investors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. ""There is no TSLA CEO today,"" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).

## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk

Musk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.

But losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock. It owns nearly 7% of the company. And due to that, its shareholders are down nearly $23 billion from the Twitter deal close.

What will Musk's infatuation with Twitter ultimately cost Tesla investors?

79,Polestar is the latest EV maker to announce a move to Tesla’s North American charging standard,317,14m7146,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14m7146/polestar_is_the_latest_ev_maker_to_announce_a/,100,1688050310.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/polestar-moves-to-tesla-charging-standard.html

Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar said Thursday that it has signed a deal with Tesla that will allow drivers of its EVs to charge at about 12,000 Tesla charging stations in North America starting next year. New Polestar vehicles sold in North America will come standard with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard, or NACS, plug starting in 2025. Owners of existing Polestars will be able to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger stations with an adapter starting in mid-2024.

Polestar’s deal follows an identical one announced by corporate sibling Volvo Cars on Tuesday. Ford Motor, General Motors and Rivian have also announced similar deals with Tesla in recent weeks. “We salute the pioneering work Tesla has done to speed up the adoption and increase the popularity of electric vehicles, and it’s great to see the Supercharger network being made available in this way,” said CEO Thomas Ingenlath. “This move will greatly increase the rate of EV adoption in a key automotive region.”

Most non-Tesla EVs and charging stations in North America use a plug design called CCS, which stands for Combined Charging System. Recent studies have found that CCS charging networks have much lower reliability than Tesla’s network. Critics have also noted that the CCS fast-charging plug is significantly larger and heavier than the NACS plug, making it difficult for some older or disabled drivers to use.   Tesla EVs can use CCS chargers with an adapter, but currently only Tesla EVs can use Tesla chargers. Tesla’s plug design was proprietary until November, when the company published the technical details of its system and made it available to other automakers and makers of EV chargers."

Tesla plans to spend $3.6 billion more on expanded battery and heavy duty truck manufacturing in Nevada, the company said Tuesday on social media.

According to its public statements, Tesla intends to hire 3,000 more people across two new facilities eventually.

It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla’s plans expand the company’s manufacturing footprint beyond the property it is already developing outside of Reno in Sparks, Nevada.

Tesla said in a statement that its new facilities will include a 100 GWh battery cell factory, where the company expects to have the capacity to produce battery cells for 2 million light duty vehicles annually, and a high-volume factory where it will eventually manufacture its class 8 heavy-duty, fully electric truck, the Tesla Semi.

Tesla began construction of its first battery factory in Nevada in 2014. It operates this plant today with a key cell supplier, co-tenant and co-investor in the factory, Panasonic.

The sprawling factory is known as GF1, Giga Nevada or the original Tesla Gigafactory. It primarily manufactures and supplies Tesla’s Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant with high-voltage battery packs.

Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo revealed details about Tesla’s plans for expansion in the state early on Monday. Tesla confirmed the plans on Tuesday ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings update, which is scheduled for Wednesday after markets close.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a ceremony in Nevada in December to kick off deliveries of the company’s Tesla Semi to a key early customer, PepsiCo.

Tesla first announced its plans to produce the Semi in 2017, and had a targeted start of production in 2019 that was delayed until 2022. The company is not yet manufacturing a high volume of Semi trucks, but is making some at the Nevada Gigafactory.

Fans and critics of Tesla have been posting images of Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding that they’ve seen on the road since that announcement, including some broken down on the shoulder.

Tesla has yet to reveal publicly how much each truck costs, and did not say how many it has produced or sold in its fourth-quarter deliveries report.

The company is expected to share further details on its Semi program in its Q4 earnings call."

82,5 Most Common Investing Mistakes (and my safeguards),286,11j6yp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11j6yp7/5_most_common_investing_mistakes_and_my_safeguards/,48,1678041245.0,"I went through a lot of surveys on investing mistakes and compiled a list of the 5 most common ones. My input in this is the safeguards that I have in place that help me avoid these mistakes.

As human beings, we're facing all kinds of risks in our lives. Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.

Think of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in). If we dissect this simple event, the risk comes from all the vehicles on the street and the safeguard is taking a look to make sure it is safe.

Now, in the world of investing, there are plenty of risks, but not that many articles when it comes to safeguards. I hope that this post is helpful to some, so let's dive right into the 5 most common mistakes:

# Mistake #1 Listening to others

Buying or selling stocks based on someone's opinion is oftentimes a bad idea. Today, there's an overload of information and it comes in various forms (Reddit posts, Tweets, YouTube videos, news articles, etc.). Many times, these are written in such a way that they sound convincing as if it is a great opportunity. In some cases, the average reader/viewer acts upon them. Of course, not all of these opinions are bad, but acting on each and everyone is generally a proven recipe to lose money. 

This is why there are plenty of posts **""Hey, I have X number of shares in company Y. The stock price is down 20% since I invested, should I hold the shares or should I sell?""** \- Every time I see a post such as this one, it is quite clear that that person doesn't know the value of the holding. This is the outcome of buying shares because of someone else's opinion. The solution is definitely not asking again for the next action.

**Safeguard: Do your own due diligence**

This can be time-consuming, but it works for me. I often times stumble upon articles/posts/videos that seem very convincing and contain a solid investment thesis. But I am aware that the person behind the information could've missed something important. So, I note down the ticker, and sometime in the future, I analyze the company myself, without bringing any bias in the process.

&#x200B;

# Mistake #2 Trying to time the market

""I'll invest after the market crash and then I'll sell on the top"" - This sounds amazing, doesn't it? The problem is that there is no successful long-term investor who timed the market over a long period of time.

Here's a title of an article written back on March 28th, 2016: 'Rich Dad' author says the 2016 market collapse he foresaw in 2002 is coming.

Oh, where do I start? Robert Kiyosaki, in 2002, foresaw a market collapse in 2016 (that never happened). He continued banging on the same door, about the market crash being here and eventually, he was right, it happened in 2022! However, the S&P500 was up 100% since this article. So anyone who ""waited"", well, that turns out to be a terrible decision. For every market crash that someone predicted, there are 10 others that the same person predicted, but never happened.

Now, let me be clear, I have no respect for this type of individuals that make money by selling content (articles, videos) that are based on fear (""OMG THE WORLD IS CRASHING!"") or the complete opposite (""THIS STOCK WILL 10X IN 2 YEARS!""). But we are surrounded by such content and it is important to acknowledge that none of these individuals have a magic ball.

**Safeguard: Ignore such information**

&#x200B;

# Mistake #3 Overestimating the future growth and/or profitability

If there's a mistake that I'm most guilty of, it is this one. It happens mostly when someone is looking at a company and imagines a bright future. However, being too optimistic means assuming higher growth/profitability that the company eventually delivers. These high and unreasonable assumptions I put in the category of ""wishful thinking"".

**Safeguard: Apply margin of safety**

I'll best illustrate this through an example. I valued Tesla at $190/share. The average cost per share of Tesla in my portfolio is $150/share. I know that I could be wrong in my assumptions, so I waited for a better entry point.

&#x200B;

# Mistake #4 Confirmation bias

This seems to exist most when someone:

\- Owns shares in a certain company

\- Has emotions about the position in that particular company

\- Really wants to be right that it is a good investment

The outcome in some cases is confirmation bias. Basically, trying to find information that confirms the thesis and ignores the ones that don't.

**Safeguard: Don't be arrogant, nobody knows everything. Businesses change over time, so adjust the assumptions accordingly**

When presented with a new piece of information, it is important to be objective and assess the impact it has on the fundamentals of a certain business and incorporate it in the valuation. If that new piece of information changes the investment decision from buy to sell, so be it. 

&#x200B;

# Mistake #5 Failing to monitor the investments

This is the easiest mistake to make, but also the easiest to prevent. Companies change, there are decisions being made fairly often and some of them have an impact on (part of) the business. To make sure you're up to date and have the most recent information, there's a simple safeguard.

**Safeguard: Read the public information coming from the company directly**

The last 4 words of the safeguard are important. Otherwise, it's mistake #1 all over again and the focus is not on facts, but on speculation.

&#x200B;

I hope that you enjoyed this post!"

(TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22",266,zuaium,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zuaium/tesla_inc_tsla_stock_review_122422/,340,1671890858.0,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

85,Peak Recession is over. The Bulls Have It in 2023—and Last Year’s Losers Are Winners,248,10nne9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10nne9k/peak_recession_is_over_the_bulls_have_it_in/,343,1674934411.0,"The stock market has flipped the script for 2023.

It was widely expected that stocks would falter in the first half of the year as the Federal Reserve continued to boost rates and then rally after midyear when the Fed finally stopped tightening.

But stocks have surged in January, with the S&P 500 indexSPX +0.25% up 6% after a 2.5% rise this past week. The Nasdaq CompositeCOMP +0.95% has risen 11% so far in 2023, following a 4.3% increase in the past five sessions. The S&P 500 rose above its 200-day moving average, an impressive technical indicator. The index has regularly advanced in intraday trading, including every session this past week, another bullish sign.

**The S&P 500’s Key Level**

It has been a risk-on rally led by some of the harder-hit sectors of 2022—technology, banks, entertainment, and commodities. Defensive groups that held up well in 2022 when the S&P 500 declined over 20%—consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities—all are down about 2% in 2023.

Within the winning groups, the most speculative stocks are leading. Warner Bros. Discovery WBD –0.60% (ticker; WBD), the debt-heavy media company, is the top stock in the S&P 500 this year, with a gain of 57%, after falling 63% in 2022.

Tesla TSLA +11.00% (TSLA) is No. 2 in the index. It’s up 44%, to $178, including a 33% rise this past week as CEO Elon Musk offered bullish comments on demand for the company’s electric vehicles. Unfortunately for Tesla investors, the stock will have to hit $352 to get back to where it started 2022.

Why the move in the market? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, one of the most bullish strategists coming into 2023, felt that inflation peaked in mid-2022 and that the Fed would “need to course correct” this year, leading to a 20% gain in 2023.

“The incoming data for the past few weeks is supportive of our view, and hence, equities are showing far more resilience than the consensus narrative,” he wrote on Friday. The consumer price index, for instance, has risen at just a 2% rate in the past six months.

The Fed is widely expected to boost the key federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point this coming week to a range of 4.5%-4.75%, and a similar-size interest-rate hike is expected in March. That could finish the tightening move that has taken short-term rates up from near zero.

Then the easing is expected to begin, though its pace is the subject of considerable debate. The bond market is discounting one rate cut late this year and many actions in 2024 that would take short-term rates down to 3%. Stock investors think the easing pace will come more quickly.

“Valuation isn’t a headwind,” says Hank Smith, head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust. “The S&P 500 isn’t egregious at 18 times forward earnings with inflation coming down.”

S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up just 4% this year. That could prove conservative. Smith points to several bullish factors for profits, including a weaker dollar, the reopening in China, lean inventories, and cost-cutting moves.

It’s rare, also, to see back-to-back yearly declines in the S&P 500. It has happened just twice since the end of World War II—in 1973-74 and for three years from 2000 through 2002.

Treasury inflation-linked savings bonds are likely to see lower yields because of the drop in inflation in recent months.

The rate on Treasury series I bonds is reset every six months, and the new rate in May probably will be lower than the current 6.89%. The May reset will be based on the change in the consumer price index from September 2022 to March 2023.

So far, three months of data are in, and there has been no change in the index. Assume 0.3-percentage-point monthly increases from January through March, and the new rate in May is likely to be about 2%.Investors swamped the Treasury’s website in October to get a 9.6% rate, which had prevailed for six months before the setting of the current rate in early November. October issuance totaled almost $7 billion, a monthly record, and fell to about $1 billion in both November and December.

Even with a lower rate, I bonds have some advantages. They offer investors protection against inflation, carry a current real rate of 0.4% on top of the inflation adjustment, and come with tax benefits. Investors can defer paying taxes on the interest income until maturity in 30 years, giving them an IRA-like quality. Interest is exempt from state and local taxes but subject to federal income taxes.

The drawback: Individuals can buy just $10,000 of the bonds annually."

So, what gives? Even if Tesla was a company that was as great as the fans claim it to be, isn't the rule that you can overpay for a good company?

Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.

93,"Tesla regains the ""hearts and minds"" of Big Morgan and Citi after plunging more than 50%.",204,z3bp4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z3bp4r/tesla_regains_the_hearts_and_minds_of_big_morgan/,224,1669268824.0,"Tesla (Tesla Inc.) market value in two months evaporated nearly $ 300 billion, but now, a growing number of Wall Street analysts have begun to say that the company's shares have fallen enough to advise investors not to miss this round of buying opportunities.

&#x200B;

As of Wednesday's U.S. stock close, Tesla was trading at $183.20, up nearly 8 percent, the biggest one-day gain since July.

&#x200B;

Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley) analyst Adam Jonas said earlier that Tesla is approaching his ""bear market target price"" of $ 150, which provides investors with the opportunity to buy at a lower price. Citi analysts also raised the stock's rating to neutral from sell, saying the stock's more than 50 percent decline this year ""offsets short-term risk/reward.

&#x200B;

Jonas wrote in a report that Tesla is the only electric car maker in Morgan Stanley's survey that is profitable through car sales, despite challenges such as slowing demand and price cuts in China.

&#x200B;

The analyst reiterated his $330 price target. He also highlighted the potential for Tesla to benefit from consumer tax credits in the United States.

&#x200B;

No coincidence. Citi analyst Itay Michaeli also upgraded the stock on Wednesday, giving him a $176 price target, one of the lowest on Wall Street. The analyst said he has become more optimistic because Tesla's plunge means some of the stock's overly optimistic expectations have now been repriced.

&#x200B;

Tesla's shares have plunged this year due to rising raw material costs, production and sales problems and customer budget pressures. Recent distractions from the company's CEO Musk, who is focused on turning around Twitter, have also dampened market sentiment.

&#x200B;

Jonas said that to stop the decline in the stock price, it is necessary to end the disruption caused by Twitter. He wrote, ""There has to be some form of sentiment 'meltdown mechanism' around the tweets to calm investor concerns about Tesla.""

&#x200B;

Despite all the challenges Tesla has faced this year, Wall Street has remained largely optimistic. Most Tesla analysts have a Buy or Neutral rating on the stock, although the stock is currently 57 percent away from the average analyst target price.

&#x200B;

In addition, Tesla's plunge this year has reduced the stock's expected price-to-earnings ratio from more than 200 times in early 2021 to 31 times now."

""Tesla's presence in Malaysia is expected to create skilled and better paying job opportunities for workers in the battery electric vehicles segment and increase the participation of local companies in the Tesla ecosystem both domestically and globally,"" it said.

The ministry said it is facilitating Tesla's entry to the country through a new initiative to boost demand for battery-powered electric vehicles and develop an entire ecosystem in the country.

The initiative aims to attract investments from top international electric-vehicle manufacturing companies to Malaysia and Tesla was the first applicant of this initiative, the ministry added.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

> We have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.

Following Q3, this was slightly disappointing at 17.2%. Lower than Q1 despite higher deliveries, in part due to lower deliveries compared to production as Tesla is shifting away from end-of-quarter delivery pushes (20K cars were on a boat at the end of the quarter that previously would've been sold before quarter end). That said, it's still up 18% or 2600 basis points YoY, easily industry leading for high volume automakers (BMW is second at 14.5%), and Tesla guided for record high margins in Q4.

I also said:

> While we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.

Since then, we have heard rumours that Berlin is expected to reach at least comparable margins to Shanghai, despite significantly higher wages. While this still remains uncertain, it would certainly reinforce their bullish sentiment on margins quoted above.

Then I said:

> I think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.

> That said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.

Since then, it appears that Texas and Berlin are not ramping faster than Shanghai did. 400K this year is looking entirely impossible, with ~100K being more likely.

That said, Shanghai has continued to ramp beyond expectation and is now at a 1.2M unit run rate. Peak production so far has been 57K Model Ys in August and 30K Model 3s in September, which would put the factory's maximum real output (remember factories can never reach their full run rate due to holidays and other downtime) at over 1M vehicles per year (highest volume car factory in the world by about 20%) or 250K per quarter. Well above even Q1's 170K.

------------------------------

**The numbers**

Updating the expected numbers from my previous posts (you can go back to them to compare what has changed if you like) based on the latest information, my Bear and Bull case numbers are as follows:

**Sales**

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,350,000|1,500,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,600,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,700,000|

**ASP**

Last time, ASPs increased significantly, from $50,000 to ~$57,500. In Q3 2022, they decreased slightly to $54,350. I expect these prices to start to increase again with the upcoming tax incentives, as Tesla mentioned they expect to take the full tax incentive from the Inflation Induction Act for vehicles, battery production and battery sourcing for a total of $10K+ per car. I expect this will offset the reduced demand from the recession and further increase ASPs to ~$57,5K in 2023 and then remain stable while Tesla continues to drive down costs.


**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs ($54K for 2022, $57,5K for 2023 and 2024) and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$73B|$81B|
|**2023**|$115B|$150B|
|**2024**|$150B|$213B|

**Operating Margin**

A year ago I said:

> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

This is where I was most wrong after Q1. Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. Since then, operating margin has decreased to 17.2%, with an expected record operating margin in Q4. This makes me slightly less confident about their steep increase in margins, so I will be adjusting those slightly to the downside.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|17%|19%|
|**2023**|19%|23%|
|**2024**|21%|27%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$12.4B|$15.4B|
|**2023**|$21.9B|$34.5B|
|**2024**|$31.5B|$57.5B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $700B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|56|45|
|**2023**|32|20|
|**2024**|22|12|

**PEG**

Since PE ratios are pretty useless by themselves, I've added a PEG rating this time. Large caps traditionally tend to float at PEG ratios between 1.5 and 3.5. That said, extreme growth companies like Tesla tend to have slightly lower PEG ratios, as investors assume the growth will come down more rapidly over time. So perhaps a PEG between 1 and 2 is more reasonable.

Also worth to note is that only 1.6% of companies in the S&P have a PEG of below 0.5, and 0.2 is the lowest PEG rating in the entire S&P. As a general rule of thumb though, anything below a PEG of 1 is typically considered undervalued.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|0.45|0.25|
|**2023**|0.42|0.16|
|**2024**|0.50|0.18|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

After Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap, I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024. With a growth rate between 44% and 67% respectively, Tesla would have a PEG rating of between 0.50 and 0.18. To get to normal PEG levels, that means Tesla stock would have to grow between 100% and 1,011% from here through Q1 2025.

Interesting to note is how Tesla only needs to double earnings to have a lower PE ratio than the S&P average, when high growth companies tend to have much higher PEs than the average; I'm expecting Tesla to almost 3x their earnings in just 3 years in the bear case.

Also worth mentioning is how, even in the bear case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($22B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the bull case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is entirely false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business (including their automotive software sales), as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid ""FSD doesn't exist"", ""energy is a scam"" and ""the Bot will never be useful"" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.

**TL;DR:** When you actually look at the data, instead of just reasoning by analogy, Tesla stock will need to grow between 100% and 1,011% through Q1 2025 to revert to the average PEG rating for fast growing large caps."
101,"How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going",162,145049d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/145049d/how_us_stocks_rose_20_from_their_lows_and_where/,86,1686301620.0,"U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.  
  
The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.  
  
On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.

While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.  
  
A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.

The narrow breadth of the S&P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.

More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.

Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.  
  
One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.  
  
Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.  
  
A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.

In four of the last six bear markets, the S&P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

This guy is actually insane and he's causing TSLA stock value to evaporate. However, Tesla's business fundamentals remain unchanged despite his erratic behavior so theoretically, the stock price plummeting is just noise. 

I'm hoping this is one of those cases where if you're long Tesla, you just hold through the noise and load up on cheap shares due to Elon's repeated bad press. This too shall pass, right?"

U.S. equities climbed to a record while Treasuries extended losses as traders braced for the start of a potentially volatile year and three expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, following stocks in Europe to an all-time high, as trading volume remained light with some markets still closed for holidays. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note rose 13 basis points to 1.64% -- its worst start to a year since 2009 -- and the dollar gained.

“Bottom line, the outlook is positive for stocks, but the removal of stimulus/accommodation from the global economy is a major theme to watch as we start 2022,” wrote Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “The Sevens Report” newsletter. “It’ll be the first time since 2018 that the Fed is hiking rates, and that change will impact markets throughout the year.”

Among notable stock moves, Tesla Inc. climbed 14% as the carmaker navigated supply-chain disruptions to report blowout deliveries for the fourth quarter. Apple Inc. gained, giving it a $3 trillion market value. And in Hong Kong, property shares dropped while China Evergrande Group halted trading.

As we flip the calendar over, many of the current market concerns are well known and arguably well priced in at both the index and more prominently at the average stock level,” wrote Art Hogan, chief markets strategist at National Securities. “We suggest markets have done an overly efficient job in selling the rumor, and will likely start buying the news.”"
106,Smoke and Mirrors. Beware of buying into the hype of flashy tech demos.,129,xv6gwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xv6gwt/smoke_and_mirrors_beware_of_buying_into_the_hype/,43,1664861336.0,"With all the talk of the latest Tesla robot demo I just want to give people a view behind the curtain.

Early tech demos of products that aren't market ready are very often smoke and mirrors.  100% of the time if they are performed in front of stakeholders they are highly scripted and many times that scripting is designed to follow a ""happy path"" that often hides considerable shortcomings in the product as it exists.  The most famous example of this is the first generation iPhone demo by Steve Jobs.  Here's some description of what was going on behind the scenes.

&#x200B;

>The iPhone could play a section of a song or a video, but it couldn’t play an entire clip reliably without crashing. It worked fine if you sent an e-mail and then surfed the Web. If you did those things in reverse, however, it might not. Hours of trial and error had helped the iPhone team develop what engineers called “the golden path,” a specific set of tasks, performed in a specific way and order, that made the phone look as if it worked. 

 

>They had AT&T, the iPhone’s wireless carrier, bring in a portable cell tower, so they knew reception would be strong. Then, with Jobs’s approval, they preprogrammed the phone’s display to always show five bars of signal strength regardless of its true strength.

&#x200B;

>None of these kludges fixed the iPhone’s biggest problem: it often ran out of memory and had to be restarted if made to do more than a handful of tasks at a time. Jobs had a number of demo units onstage with him to manage this problem. If memory ran low on one, he would switch to another while the first was restarted. 

&#x200B;

Needless to say everything worked out for Apple in the end and the iPhone was a massive success, but it doesn't always go that way.

A personal anecdote, I worked on a multimillion dollar project for a fortune 100 company.  By the time I came on the project as a contractor to right the ship it was already a garbage pile on top of a toxic waste dump.  The C-level was losing patience and it was clear the project was doomed to fail but about a month in we were asked to walk them through a demo no matter what and told jobs were on the line.  Our contractors had a lot of startup experience going into this unlike the rest of the team we were supplementing so we knew what to do.  We basically hard coded functionality in the software all over the place and inserted custom values in the database that would not have been possible for users to add through the actual program anytime in the near future and made it look like the project was making considerable progress. I reality it was easily still a year or two away from being able to actually do the things we made it do and several more from being what they actually wanted.  I created a complete script, click here, click here, open this, step by step, and if you fuck up the program is going to crash.  The team's lead manager learned the script like the back of his hand and walked through the demo in the C-suite and the project got funded for another six months.  The in-house engineering team called us ""the Wizards of Oz.""  Six months later it predictably melted down and everyone packed it up to move to the next thing. A couple executives lost their cushy 7 figure jobs as a result.  This is EXTREMELY common.  

That was the most glaring example but I have done this same thing or seen it done dozens of times and several of those were walked out in front of investors.  Many of those products never even came close to the capabilities we scripted into the demo.  I would be shocked if a single early demo from any tech company doesn't have piles of hard coded garbage in some intermediate build just to get through the demo, then it's up to the engineers to just figure it out later.

It's very easy to spoof your way through showing off a new phone's planned features or make a robot slow walk a circle on a stage.  It's about 100x harder to make a phone that someone can actually use like a phone or make a robot that can do actual work and doesn't fall over and die when it steps on a Lego.  I just want to make people aware that this is how the tech world operates since reading some of the comments I've seen after big flashy tech demos I realize this is not common knowledge.

Sometimes the engineers will push through and you will end up with an iPhone but a lot of times by the time the demo comes around everyone in the back knows the project is already doomed and they are just trying to extract value from something they've already sunk millions into or they secretly know that it will easily take years to get the product to the usable state portrayed in the demo and are trying to excite investors.  Some of these projects you will never see or hear mentioned ever again and it's even more common in hardware products than software.  

This is just a friendly warning to take all tech demos with a giant grain of salt."

Reuters new article headline: Tesla's third-quarter deliveries miss estimates

Source: https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1576607956531122179

Oct 2 - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Sunday announced lower-than-expected electric vehicle deliveries in the third quarter, as logistical challenges overshadowed its record deliveries.

Tesla delivered 343,830 electric vehicles, a record for the world's most valuable automaker, but less than the 359,162 analysts on average had expected, according to Refinitiv. A year earlier Tesla delivered 241,300 units.

The latest deliveries fell short of Tesla's production of 365,923 vehicles, which is rare for the automaker which has seen its deliveries higher or similar to production in many of recent quarters.

---------
The numbers:

-Deliveries 343,830, +42% y/y, estimate 357,938  
-Model S/X deliveries 18,672 vs. 9,275 y/y, estimate 16,092  
-Production 365,923 vehicles, +54% y/y, estimate 359,853  
-Model 3/Y production 345,988, +51% y/y, estimate 356,694 (2 estimates)

>  
>The key problem here is that E,S and G are all weighted equally, while not close to being equal in practice. E can be quantified, while S and G are entirely subjective. The equal weighting of each metric means that companies outstanding in one area are beaten out by seemingly much worse companies overall because of the other two dimensions.  
>  
>The scores also don’t account for the wider impact that a company might have had, for example Tesla isn’t given get credit for helping to push other automakers towards EV’s.

>  
>*He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by* [*Refinitive ESG*](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3579819-1&h=2880314828&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&a=Refinitive+ESG)*, which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years — one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 — the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.*  
*He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 — just six weeks apart — and found that 85% of firms’ scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.*  
>  
> *Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&S score on the firm’s future stock returns. These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies.* 

ESG FUNDS:

>*Sector exposures across the funds revealed that information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, and an almost zero allocation in energy. This was one of the key drivers behind the shorter-term recent outperformance of ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 whilst energy declined.*  
>  
>So the overperformance of ESG funds compared to a wide index was because they are tech heavy.  
>  
>*Google was the most commonly held stock across most funds; Alphabet Inc. was in 12 funds, with an average weight of 1.9% . The companies with the highest average weight across the funds were Apple (5.6%) and Microsoft (5.0%)*  
>  
>So ESG funds are basically investing in the same things that most other funds do: Tech (FAANG) and industrials, with very little, if any allocation towards energy. This is permissible by their rules because all of these companies have good ESG scores. Afterall their CEO’s don’t tweet.

I see too many guys talking about how you have to be greedy when others are fearful and how this is time to buy because of the terrible market sentiment. IMO this old (and good) advice only works when people **also** sell their riskier assets (stocks and junk bonds) to hold safer assets (cash, high quality bonds and some blue chips and passive ETFs). 

The problem is investors still hold huge amounts of stocks (60%+) , the junk  to AAA bonds spread is still very low and we keep having net cash **inflows** into the stock market. I hear about ""mid/low cap tech bargains"" all the time, investors keep seeking risky assets even if they are fearful...they are still trying to find the next Tesla! 

So, investors are scared but they are not looking for safe assets! Why? Maybe its all about inertia. In the last 15 years every time things looked bad the FED injected tons of money and bang! new ATH in a matter of months. Selling was always a mistake in the last 15 years, so investors are incredibly reluctant to sell even if they think the market will keep falling. 

In previous bear markets we see good buying opportunites happened when stock allocation levels fell below 50% (closer to 40%), a huge spike in AAA-to-junk bonds spread, massive outflows in the stock market and OC people talking about total collapse and the end of the western civilization instead of trying to find the next Apple. 

I feel like we are not nearly close to this point, I feel like we are not even close to the bottom yet! And I dont think there are good bargains right now. Maybe I am missing something, maybe its wrong to compare 2022 with 2008 and 2001... maybe this time is different. IDK, what do you think?"

Still in a very early phase, but I want to share my results.

First I collected ESG data from two notable ESG rating agencies (MSCI & Sustainalytics) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data. When I calculated the correlation with each other they were not correlated (anti-correlated if anything, Pearson -0.25, p= 0.37). This indicates to me it is just random noise without intrinsic information.

Then I collected credit rating information from two notable credit rating agencies (Moody's & S&P) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data (same companies used for ESG analysis). These ratings were strongly correlated implying some underlying information (Pearson 0.65, p = 0.008). But when I then ranked these car businesses by their average credit rating Tesla scored the lowest with 2 billion debt, 20 billion cash & 10 billion yearly income. On the other hand business leveraged to the tits & flirting with bankruptcy (Toyota 210 billion debt, 50 billion cash, 20 billion yearly income, General Motors 110 billion debt, 20 billion cash, 10 billion yearly income) were scoring higher.

I realize more data can be collected and the numbers can be cherry-picked for a brighter picture, but overall this initial result paint a black and white picture: ratings = bullshit. What am I missing?

Thanks redditors! :)

EDIT1: I have gotten a lot of feedback on things that are missing & an interest in nuance. 

I agree there's is a lot that can be done, my original plan was about 1000x more ambitious. Will update when I get to it. For now I have added p-values.

Wait on the sidelines maybe put in dividend utility stocks and wait for what could be a huge bull market rally a year or two from now.

Any thoughts?"
117,I think everyone is still sleeping on lithium mining companies,104,x1zjmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x1zjmq/i_think_everyone_is_still_sleeping_on_lithium/,177,1661906576.0,"Tesla has the ambitious plan of selling 20 million cars year after year starting from 2030, the amount of lithium that you need to sell that many cars is about 1,2 million tons of lithium and the amount of lithium that we were expected to have by 2030 is anywhere from 1.8 to 1.9 million tons of lithium. that measure can easily be estimated based on current reserves, upcoming projects and battery recycling.

The leading researcher in the mineral space for electric vehicles benchmark minerals intelligence estimates that we will only have one 1.8 million tons of lithium by 2030. 

Lithium extraction is not something that can be fast tracked it actually takes on average 7 to 10 years to bring lithium from the ground into the markets, in 2019 we only mined under 400,000 tons of lithium.

Every car manufacturer globally is planning on selling tens of millions of electric cars, Tesla is really the only car manufacturer that has a supply chain figure it out and can source as much Lithium as it can get his hands on, where will the rest of other car manufacturer source enough lithium?

We will be faced with a massive Lithium shortage, lithium is already becoming the new oil and when we couple the fact that there will be a massive shortage for electric vehicles and energy storage the vast amount of wealth that will be generated in the future in my humble opinion is from Junior mining companies. China is way ahead of the United States and has recognized this problem which is why they have invested heavily into mining in other countries.

The money that is made in this electric vehicle revolution are from the companies that own the land and mine for the most important commodity of our green revolution future, lithium. Not from the electric car companies themselves. 

Companies like Sigma lithium, liontown resources, lake resources, are surging thousands of percent without even having extracted one grain of lithium. When they start to sell lithium they will take off even further.

There are a ton of Junior companies out there that have massive potential in my humble opinion the best ones are Brazil Minerals, Sayona mining, Atlantic lithium, lake resources, Piedmont lithium. 


To those of you who think there is a replacement technology, there’s no replacement technology that can be brought to market within the next 15 to 20 years, let alone a replacement technology we still haven’t even figured out how to deliver solid-state batteries to market. It’s one thing to create a new technology and another to commercialize it. For now it looks like and for the next decade car manufacturers are soley committed to batteries that use lithium."

Am I missing anything? Anyone advising AGAINST owning Ford shares?

TBH I'm not a fan of Ford, but there's no arguing they have a strong customer base. Plus in my honest opinion I think Ford has the edge up on the other vehicle manufacturers in regards to swapping over into EV. (Obv nobody is close to Tesla, but I'm speaking from a non EV standpoint). Tesla has all their blueprints up for free public use, only a matter of time before a big manufacturer like Ford or Toyota tweak things to their liking.

***Disclaimer: I have a small position in Tesla with an average price of around $150/share.***

The post covers the following:

1. Introduction
2. Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.
3. Competitive landscape (profitability, debt & future growth/ROIC)
4. Historical financial performance
5. Assumptions & valuation
6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

I'd describe Tesla as a car company with big dreams and impressive technology. There are bulls and bears with different assumptions about the future, but if we look backward, there's no doubt that as a company, it disrupted the industry and accelerated the transition to EVs.

It operates in two segments, automotive (responsible for 96% of the revenue and almost all the gross profit) and energy generation and storage (attributing the remaining 4% of the revenue).

Now, I mentioned big dreams. That's of course, coming from Elon Musk. Let's take a look at a few of them:

1. FSD (Full self-driving capability) & robotaxis - Tesla was to some extent the first mover in this area and is likely the company with the most data. However, in my opinion, the competitors are catching up. As for the robotaxis, there's still some time until it becomes a reality and when it happens, Tesla won't be the only player on the market.
2. The ""energy generation and storage"" segment is to be worth as much as the automotive segment - Another big prediction that so far seems to have an incredibly low probability. Its current size is insignificant, it's not a profitable segment, and in order to become a significant portion of Tesla's value, well, it will take a long time.
3. Optimus - The humanoid robot is expected to be on sale by 2027 with a cost of $20k. This was revealed on the latest AI day and some engineers who followed the event (and are not employed at Tesla) weren't impressed. They weren't impressed by the current state of Optimus, although they were impressed by the progress made in such a short period of time.
4. Tesla will sell 20m cars annually by 2030 - This is something that we'll come back to.

One of the jobs of Elon Musk, like any other CEO, is to be positive and optimistic about the future. That doesn't mean everything will happen nor that the timeline is accurate (especially with Elon).

There are 110k employees at Tesla, yet the tweets of one of them seem to have more impact on the share price compared to all the work the others do. It seems as if Elon has shifted from being one of Tesla's biggest assets to one of its biggest liabilities. However, this post will not be about Elon, it will focus on Tesla as a company and its fundamentals.

&#x200B;

**Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.**

Let's zoom out for a moment. It is obvious that there's a lot of stuff going on (and who knows what else will be announced in the next decade), so in my forecast, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)

To value any car company, there are two main inputs:

1. \# of cars sold annually
2. Margin per car

For younger car companies, capacity is also something to be looked into.

If we look at the statistics, the number of cars sold worldwide annually is pretty flat over time.

2019: **74.9m;** 2020: **63.8m;** 2021: **66.7m;** 2022: **65.4m;** 2023: **71.0m (expected)**

We can round that to 70m cars/year.

Tesla has been growing quite fast when it comes to deliveries

2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**

So, based on the 2022 numbers, Tesla has roughly a 2% share.

If we go back at the 20m cars/year prediction, that represents a staggering **28.5% share!** How realistic is that? Well, I'll let you be the judge.

How about the production capacity? Currently, that's around **1.9m**. So, if Tesla wants to grow, they need to invest here A LOT. How much? Let's take a look at their historical investments:

The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars. So, on average, Tesla would need to invest around $20k in capex to increase the production capacity by 1 car. Using the gross PPE from the balance sheet as a metric for all past investments ($43.9b) that led to the 1.9m capacity, we get to a similar outcome. Of course, not all of the $43.9b is related to manufacturing, there's a portion for R&D, general support functions, etc.

This gives a good idea of the future investments required. If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.

&#x200B;

**Competitive landscape**

In this segment, I'd like to take a look at 10+ competitors in this industry and look into quite some metrics. I'll start with what the critics normally point out, the price of the company.

&#x200B;

|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Market cap (in $b)|P/E ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$74.9|$381.7|36.5|
|Toyota|$232.2|$188.6|10.0|
|BYD|$47.6|$96.3|51.0|
|Volkswagen|$261.2|$71.9|3.6|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|$70.7|5.1|
|BMW|$128.9|$58.9|3.1|
|General Motors|$147.2|$47.8|5.7|
|Ford|$151.8|$46.4|5.2|
|Stellantis|$172.7|$46.1|2.8|
|Honda|$108.1|$38.8|7.9|

&#x200B;

Tesla's P/E is roughly 7x higher than the average of the competitors (with a few exceptions). The question that is asked over and over is, how the hell is Tesla worth so much more than Toyota when Toyota sells 10m cars a year (with Tesla 1.4m for the full 2022)? To answer that question, we need to look into 3 segments:

1. Profitability
2. Debt
3. Future growth/ROIC

&#x200B;

**Let's start with profitability:**

&#x200B;

|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Gross profit|Operating expenses|Operating margin|Operating profit (in $m)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$74.9|26.6%|9.9%|16.7%|$12,510|
|Toyota|$232.2|17.0%|9.9%|7.1%|$16,511|
|BYD|$47.6|15.1%|11.8%|3.3%|$1,547|
|Volkswagen|$261.2|18.5%|10.2%|8.3%|$21,555|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|22.5%|11.0%|11.5%|$16,279|
|BMW|$128.9|16.5%|6.6%|9.9%|$13,079|
|General Motors|$147.2|13.6%|5.4%|8.2%|$12,025|
|Ford|$151.8|11.4%|4.3%|7.1%|$10,696|
|Stellantis|$172.7|20.2%|8.5%|11.7%|$20,173|
|Honda|$108.1|20.0%|14.4%|5.6%|$6,097|

The companies are sorted based on their market cap. Although Tesla has 1/3rd of Toyota's revenue, they make almost as much operating profit! Why? It's obvious, they have higher margins. So, what contributes to that? A few points have to be noted:

1. Tesla does not sell through dealerships - this allows them to have higher gross margins as there are no 3rd parties to pay.
2. Tesla famously doesn't spend money on marketing (funny enough, Elon bought a company that depends on advertising, but anyway, let's get back to Tesla)
3. Tesla could build factories from scratch, perfectly suited for EVs, while the big companies have to invest to re-purpose their existing factories.

There are only two luxury cars that have higher operating margins than Tesla (Porsche & Ferrari), but they're targeting a very niche audience and not the mass-market.

**Let's continue by looking at the debt of each company:**

&#x200B;

|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|Market cap (in $b)|Net debt (in $b)|Market cap + Net debt (EV)|EV / Operating profit|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$12,510|$381.7|$ (15.2)|$366.5|29.3|
|Toyota|$16,511|$188.6|$143.6|$332.2|20.1|
|BYD|$1,547|$96.3|$ (3.0)|$93.3|60.3|
|Volkswagen|$21,555|$71.9|$157.0|$228.9|10.6|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|$70.7|$95.1|$165.7|10.2|
|BMW|$13,079|$58.9|$83.3|$142.2|10.9|
|General Motors|$12,025|$47.8|$89.2|$137.0|11.4|
|Ford|$10,696|$46.4|$97.8|$144.2|13.5|
|Stellantis|$20,173|$46.1|$ (20.1)|$26.0|1.3|
|Honda|$6,097|$38.8|$28.3|$67.1|11.0|

Why is looking at the debt so important? Well:

1. First of all, it isn't free. It needs to be repaid and with interest. The auto industry is known to be cyclical, but the debt doesn't really care about that.
2. The companies that are better positioned from a financial leverage perspective can afford to lower prices temporarily and steal market share. Tesla is in a great position for this, while the giants cannot afford to break even (from an operating profit point of view)
3. High leverage combined with unprofitable business leads to bankruptcy.

So, I decided to look at this a bit differently. I wanted to check how much would one pay to acquire each company debt-free and what is the return (measured through operating profit). Now, Tesla's ratio isn't 7x higher, but less than 3x higher than the average competitor.

Remember Toyota? It needs 9 years of operating profit to cover its net debt! Tesla costs 367m to be bought debt-free, while Toyota 332m - quite close!

P.S. I took a shortcut for the EV calculation, it's not 100% accurate (it doesn't take into account minority interest, for example), but it's quite close.

**Lastly, let's take a look at the last piece of the puzzle, the growth & ROIC**

&#x200B;

|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|EV / Operating profit|NTM revenue growth|ROIC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla|$12,510|29.3|45.0%|26.4%|
|Toyota|$16,511|20.1|14.5%|4.0%|
|BYD|$1,547|60.3|46.7%|7.9%|
|Volkswagen|$21,555|10.6|5.8%|6.0%|
|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|10.2|3.5%|8.7%|
|BMW|$13,079|10.9|6.5%|7.0%|
|General Motors|$12,025|11.4|9.4%|6.5%|
|Ford|$10,696|13.5|5.9%|6.2%|
|Stellantis|$20,173|1.3|4.0%|19.5%|
|Honda|$6,097|11.0|24.0%|4.1%|

It's obvious that Tesla and BYD are the exceptions when we look at the expected revenue growth for the next 12 months.

However, what's also impressive is that Tesla has the highest ROIC - They're making the best return on their investments. All of that while also spending money on all kinds of side projects.

In my opinion, the culture within Tesla seems to be better suited for innovation, compared to the old-school, traditional, car manufacturers.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

Tesla's revenue has increased significantly, from $21.5b back in 2018 to almost $80b in the last twelve months. At the same time, the gross margin increased from 19% to almost 27%.

The operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) have decreased as % of sales from 20% to 10%, leading to an operating margin of 17%, which is much higher than the average.

Over the same period, they reduced their debt from $14b to $6b (while accumulating $21b+ in cash) leading to a net debt position of -$15b.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions & valuation**

As mentioned above, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)

My assumptions are as follows:

**Revenue growth**: 35% in the next 12 months, declining to 30%, then to 25%, all the way down to 5% in year 10. By then, the projected revenue is close to **$400b (an increase of 431% vs. LTM)** \- representing roughly 6m cars per year (8.6% share) - This also means $80b in capex over time (4m additional capacity x $20k)

Just a reminder of how Tesla's deliveries have progressed over time:

2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**

&#x200B;

**Operating margin**: 10% for the next 2 years due to a recession, then recovery to 18% over time.

**Discount rate:** 9.5%

**Terminal growth rate:** 5%

The valuation based on my assumptions is **$563b** **(179.84/share)**

&#x200B;

***Note: Adjustments have been made for cash/debt, unearned revenue as well as outstanding equity options***

&#x200B;

Now, before anyone jumps on me, these are my assumptions and I could be significantly wrong. So, if you have other expectations, I hope the table below can help.

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

The table below shows how the valuation changes (per share), based on assumptions regarding the revenue in 10 years, the operating margin, and how the market share / # of cars to be sold to get there.

|Revenue/ Operating margin|16%|18%|20%|22%|Cars/year (share %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|250% ($262.0b)|$109.5|$125.2|$139.2|$152.2|3.5m (5%)|
|325% ($318.1b)|$129.5|$148.4|$165.5|$181.2|4.5m (6.5%)|
|431% (397.4b)|$156.3|$179.8|$201.1|$220.8|6m (8.6)|
|1670% (1.33t)|$445.6|$519.3|$589.2|$654.8|20m (28.5%)|

The last row represents Elon Musk's crazy scenario of selling 20m+ cars per year (without even taking into account the energy generation and storage segment to be the same size as the automotive one) For that to happen, Tesla needs to grow at a rate of 35% annually for a decade.

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is undervalued at the current price levels, however, it was significantly overvalued for a long period of time.

I hope you enjoyed the post and apologies for the length, I wanted to make sure to cover all the points that I find important.

I welcome disagreements on everything mentioned above."
123,What are your stock picks when the market eventually turns around?,86,xt9irc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xt9irc/what_are_your_stock_picks_when_the_market/,152,1664667184.0,"When the market turns around is anyone's guess. If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. 

Now for the meat and potatoes. What will you be buying up when the news eventually comes out that we are no longer having severe inflation problems? The perfect scenario would be Jerome Powell announces ""we are no longer going to remain hawkish, inflation is now under control ..."" and the rest will be history. Here is a breakdown of my portfolio picks when that day comes, which remember could be in a few months or in 2024, hell it could even be in 2026 for all I know. Right now my portfolio is about 95% cash. I will breakdown and explain each of these holdings: 

25% of portfolio will be in VOO - VOO is the lazy, set it and forget it ETF. It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. 

20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. 

10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? 

10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. 

8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. 

8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. 

7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. 

2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago. 

10% of portfolio will be in cash to do swing trading."
124,Tesla's Market Cap Drop Is Bigger Than the Legacy Car Industry,90,10c4fme,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10c4fme/teslas_market_cap_drop_is_bigger_than_the_legacy/,99,1673739820.0,"https://www.statista.com/chart/29002/tesla-market-capitalization/

Shockingly, Tesla’s drop in market capitalization, roughly $800 billion from its peak, is bigger than the combined valuation of pretty much any legacy car manufacturer you could think of. As the following chart shows, the combined market capitalization of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler and PSA), Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Renault is still more than $100 billion shy of Tesla’s market cap decline.

So what caused that extraordinary fall of one of the best-performing stocks of 2020 and 2021? Firstly, Tesla was always valued as a high-growth stock, meaning much of its valuation was based on its future potential. As the economic outlook darkened throughout 2022, so did Tesla’s potential for future growth, especially considering that inflation and high interest rates will eventually affect consumer spending on big-ticket items such as cars.

Secondly, Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is clearly playing a role in Tesla’s recent decline. Not only did Musk sell billions worth of Tesla shares this year to finance the deal, but he’s also been tied up in leading the social media platform since the deal was completed at the end of October. His very public approach to overhauling Twitter has left many Tesla shareholders wondering whether he’s still fully focused on his role as Tesla CEO.

Musk himself offered a different explanation for Tesla’s decline on Tuesday: “In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,” he tweeted, not explaining why Tesla has underperformed the overall market significantly this year.

Just a note, this article was from Dec 2022, so there's been a further drop in TSLA since then."
125,Opinion: People are still underestimating Twitter's risk on TSLA,82,yr7abh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr7abh/opinion_people_are_still_underestimating_twitters/,103,1668061420.0,"**Edit: right on cue. Musk warns of Twitter bankruptcy:** [https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/)

Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.

Tesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.

**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**

I used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.

He cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.

His ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.

Users are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.

Worse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.

**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**

Twitter's debt payments are around \~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.

If advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.

He leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.

**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**

It's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.

**tldr:** Musk desperately orders features in and out. Advertisers pull out or sit on the sidelines. Revenue falls. Musk tries even more desperate things. More advertisers leave. Musk needs to sell more TSLA to fund Twitter experiment."

Now, I am surprised by the number being that high, it’s biggest output, the Shanghai factory, was in limbo for more than half of the time, so I am assuming Berlin and Texas came through and helped to hold up the numbers? 

Tesla stated that it is still in progress to meet its 1.5 million goal by end of year, but that IMO,it’s they need to deliver over 400k per quarter for the next two quarters back to back.

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression? Please provide your thoughts and comments below."

There’s no sugarcoating it, Cathy Wood’s Ark Funds got clobbered, her strategy does work in the current environment. I’m not arguing that she’s the best fund manager of all time. No risk management

I’m just looking at the stocks in ARKK such as Zoom, Tesla, Block, Shopify, Teladoc, Roku, etc. and asking myself do we really think these stocks won’t be around 5 years from now? 

These stocks are all down like 80% or more from ATHs and a lot of these stocks are trading well below pre-pandemic levels 

The bottom for the  S&P 500 and QQQ was around September 2002 during the dot.com bubble, and March 2009 for the financial crisis. 

Apple, which was more speculative back then before it was the tech giant today, bottomed in 12/2000 and 12/2008.

 Netflix bottomed in 7/2007. 

Google bottomed in 11/2008. 

Amazon bottomed in 9/2001 and 11/2008. 

The point is that high-growth, more speculative tech companies hit their bottom months or up to a year before the broad index funds. 

To outperform the market you need to be doing something radically different

Everyone gave up on Cathy’s stocks a while ago and the the sentiment towards her and her strategies are sooo negative right now. It may soon be time to buy the fear. To follow the herd is to buy high and sell low after that 2020 stimulus bubble in equities 


Cathy may be a fool in this market cycle, but how the f$ck are you people not buying at least a few shares of these ARK funds? It’s much closer to a bottom than the broad index funds"

133,"Even the best investors in the world make mistakes, Charles Munger "" investment in Alibaba was one of the worst mistakes I ever made.”",65,11acfro,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11acfro/even_the_best_investors_in_the_world_make/,27,1677195517.0," 

**Munger bought his initial stake at around $246 per share.**

Munger was probably convinced this was a passing phase and things will get back to normal after Jack Ma is “taught” a lesson in adhering to the government line. He doubled down and kept adding as the stock kept falling. He added substantial quantities in the July-September quarter around $182 and again in the October-December quarter around $145. Each time he nearly doubled his position from before. He probably realised his mistake and sold half his position in the January-March quarter of 2022 ..

Munger said he remains optimistic about China’s economy, but conceded that Daily Journal’s investment in Alibaba was “one of the worst mistakes I ever made.”

“I never stopped to think \[Alibaba\] was still a retailer. It’s going to be a competitive business,” he said.

Munger was questioned as well about why he (and Buffett) prefer to own shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as opposed to Elon Musk’s Tesla [(TSLA)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link).

“BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China it’s almost ridiculous,” Munger said. But he conceded that it’s an expensive stock. Berkshire has been [trimming its stake in BYD](http://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/investing/berkshire-hathaway-unwinds-byd-china-investment-intl-hnk/index.html) over the past year.

Munger, who has been a significant critic of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, continued his attack on digital assets Wednesday, continuously referring to crypto as a four-letter curse word used to describe excrement.

“I think people who oppose my position are idiots,” he said, adding that investors should avoid people who promote cryptocurrencies, once again saying that cryptocurenecies are “worthless,” “crazy,” “ridiculous” and “unspeakable.”

Munger also recently wrote [an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-america-should-ban-crypto-regulation-economy-finance-china-england-trading-currency-securities-commodity-gamble-11675287477) suggesting that the US ban cryptocurrencies.

Investors may hear more from Munger in just a few months. He is expected to appear with Buffett in Omaha on May 6 at Berkshire’s annual meeting."

Sure they’re fast but are we sure they’re going to stay on top of the market for the next 10 years? BMW and Mercedes have been making leaps and bounds with their technology recently, not to mention KIA who just released an 800hp monster. There’s a lot more competition now and I’m seeing these cars pop up all over my city. 

On top of that, they’re pretty basic and not as fun as some of the other brands. 

If I were to say they’re going to stay on top, it’d be because they focus more on energy storage and shift away from cars. 

No hate please, I’m thinking about putting a lot into them is the only reason I’m asking. Car companies are hard to run and I have faith this guy knows what he’s doing, he clearly does.

I could also see Tesla becoming the next Toyota of cars (cheap but plentiful cars) however I don’t see them competing with upper end brands for much longer."

How do you guys do it?",59,14iwre3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14iwre3/am_i_doing_the_fun_individual_stock_allocation/,46,1687725845.0,"I'm mostly index funds, but I've decided to allocate 5% of my portfolio to individual stocks.  
The ""strategy"" I've decided to follow is buying a select number of blue chip tech stocks. So far I'm DCA'ing into Apple and Tesla, thinking of MSFT and some others. Reason being I think blue chip tech stocks have more upside but similar downside (well maybe with the exception of Tesla) as non-tech blue chips like Disney or Nike or whatever. I know these companies have huge market caps and have run up a lot, but I think long term they still have a lot of room to grow.  
Having said that, obviously I already own a good amount of these stocks in my index funds. So I've begun to question whether I'm doing this wrong and the ""fun"" allocation to individual stocks need to be geared more towards smaller riskier companies that could moon if I'm lucky.

136,"GM smashes expectations and guides toward a strong 2023, despite margin squeeze",60,10q7wtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10q7wtl/gm_smashes_expectations_and_guides_toward_a/,26,1675193014.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/general-motors-gm-earnings-q4-2022.html


General Motors handily beat Wall Street’s top- and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter, while forecasting another solid year of results in 2023.

The strong report suggests GM is hanging onto record, or near-record, results even as the U.S. automotive industry begins to normalize after several years of record-low inventories and resilient consumer demand.

Here’s how GM performed to close out last year, compared with analysts’ estimates as compiled by Refinitiv:
Adjusted earnings per share: $2.12 vs. $1.69 expected
Revenue: $43.11 billion vs. $40.65 billion expected

The fourth-quarter results easily topped a year earlier, when the automaker reported an adjusted EPS of $1.35 and revenue of $33.58 billion for the final three months of 2021.

GM’s full-year 2022 revenue came in at $156.7 billion, with net income attributable to stockholders of $9.9 billion and adjusted earnings before interest and tax at a record $14.5 billion. Those results marked the high-end of the company’s previously revised guidance.

Still, the automaker is showing signs of a margin squeeze. GM’s net income slipped last year, down by less than 1% from full-year 2021 to $9.9 billion, with a profit margin that was off 1.6 percentage points to 6.3%. Its adjusted profit margin was 9.2%, down 2.1 percentage points compared with the previous year.

GM said it incurred special charges in the fourth quarter of $511 million related to a buyout program for its Buick dealers and $657 million related to shuttering its limited operation in Russia.

For 2023, GM expects net income attributable to stockholders of between $8.7 billion and $10.1 billion. It expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of between $6 and $7.

Those results would be below 2022 earnings, but above average analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitv that called for EPS of $5.73 this year.

GM forecast 2023 net automotive cash from operating activities to come in between $16 billion and $20 billion and sees automotive free cash flow of $5 billion to $7 billion.

Wall Street has been bracing for a “demand destruction” scenario for the last several quarters, with some analysts suggesting automakers may need to execute cost-cutting measures to offset recessionary spending shifts.

Demand and pricing for GM’s vehicles “remain strong,” CFO Paul Jacobson told reporters Tuesday morning. He said GM is being “appropriately cautious” but vehicle inventories remain constrained amid strong demand.

“We think the underlying business is going to be pretty consistent with what we saw last year, and I think that’s a slightly more bullish statement than where most of the market is,” he said.

Following recent price cuts for Tesla vehicles and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E crossover, Jacobson said GM feels its EVs “are well positioned” with pricing. GM’s EVs currently range from the mid-$20,000 Chevrolet Bolt models to the more than $100,000 Hummer vehicles.

GM will execute a $2 billion cost-cutting plan through the next two years, according to Jacobson. Up to half of those savings are expected this year, he said. GM expects some head count reduction due to attrition but the company is “not planning layoffs,” Jacobson said."
137,Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter may take inspiration from Chinese super apps,53,xw8um7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xw8um7/elon_musks_plans_for_twitter_may_take_inspiration/,62,1664971584.0,"Elon Musk’s revived $44 billion deal to buy Twitter sparked fresh debate over what the billionaire will do with the service if he eventually owns it.

On Tuesday, Musk tweeted that buying Twitter is an “accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” He did not provide further details.

Musk may be hinting toward so-called “super apps” which are popular in China and other parts of Asia and pioneered by the likes of Chinese technology giant Tencent.

Super apps is a term to describe an app that often acts as a one-stop shop for all your mobile needs. For example, you might order a taxi or food via the app and at the same time do payments and messaging. This eliminates the need to have multiple apps for different functions.

Chinese app WeChat, run by Tencent, is the biggest super app in the world, with over a billion users.

In WeChat, users can message people, do mobile banking, pay for things online or in store by scanning a barcode, play games, post videos, do online shopping, hail a car and many other things.

When Musk talks about “the everything app,” he could be thinking about WeChat.

The Tesla CEO has previously expressed admiration for WeChat calling the app “great” during a town hall with Twitter employees in June. Musk said there is no WeChat equivalent outside of China.

“And I think that there’s a real opportunity to create that,” Musk told employees. “You basically live on WeChat in China because it’s so useful and so helpful to your daily life. And I think if we could achieve that, or even close to that with Twitter, it would be an immense success.”

Musk said that he wants at least a billion people using Twitter, up from 237.8 million at the end of the second quarter.

One of WeChat’s biggest features is WeChat Pay. This is a feature where users can scan a barcode in a store to pay via their mobile or they can send money to friends via the chat function. WeChat Pay can also be used for purchases online.

Good luck to Musk and looking forward to the new brand new app. What do you think?"
138,"What stocks will flourish during U.S. ""Reshoring"" trend?",54,z9xm3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z9xm3d/what_stocks_will_flourish_during_us_reshoring/,69,1669924031.0,"Here are my thoughts please feel free to contradict/supplement me since I'm by no means any kind of expert or even moderately knowledgeable in this subject.

I think reshoring is going to be a strong trend given that:

* It would be a popular rally cry from both political parties. It would be very popular cause especially in manufacturing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, etc -- some of which are possibly swing states.

* The more unrest we see out of China and Russia, the more this concept will gain support.

* Some big companies will want to shore up their supply chain (e.g. maybe like car companies with semiconductors). They will lobby hard for this.

* Labor unions should also love this as more manufacturing = more jobs and more union members.

Some effects might be:

* Inflation. Reestablishing manufacturing is going to require initial investment in building factories

* Our labor is more expensive than China's. The labor market is already tight on the supply side right now, if we were to create millions of well paying labor jobs this might create scarcity of labor (will this trigger wage-price spiral)?

* Retaliatory trade wars. Our legislations encouraging re-shoring might be interpreted as anti free trade which may trigger China to launch their own protectionist rules, causing a cycle of hostility (although arguably this was going to happen anyway).

* Revival of a living-wage labor class, or middle class.

So what kind of companies will benefit from this? 

* Companies that help other companies build factories, infrastructure, etc (Like Catepillar).

* Companies that create automation -- like Tesla robots? (I'm sure there's dozens of better companies just serving as eg.)

* Companies that help improve logistics -- like software robot companies, Nvidia, etc.

* Companies that serve a middle class that was shrinking, but maybe will start growing again. Like Target maybe?

* Companies that will build homes around these new factory towns. 

SO what kind of companies will get hurt from this? I'm actually not sure.

Would love your thoughts on any of this, **but especially what companies will benefit/hurt the most and why**?"

141,What are good P/E ratios for different sectors?,46,zvohrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zvohrm/what_are_good_pe_ratios_for_different_sectors/,59,1672065680.0,"I’m only 25 so all of my investing knowledge has come from the crazy bull market the last few years. Companies were “good buys” with p/e of 30+ or Tesla/amazon of 100+. Now I know that isn’t always or normally a good P/E to buy a company. 



What is everyone’s opinions on a good P/E for different sectors? For example $CROX is currently at a P/E of 10. I bought in when it was at 8 because I figured that’s a great buy. It worked out for me but I was ignorant because I don’t actually know if that’s normal for clothing/shoe industry. 


How about GOOG at 17? Is this normal for tech pre 2019? 


HD at 20? Seems high imo but it’s a solid company. 


LMT at 22 also seems high. But in a bear market it’s slow and steady gains/dividends. But no real growth. 


Any insight on what normal P/E is in a bear market or normal bull market would be helpful. To me it doesn’t all make sense with GOOG having a lower P/E than HD or CROX. Is everything still overpriced or is this normal?"

I always wondered why CNBC had this clown as a regular contributor. He is an entertainer, not an investor. I remember a few years ago, he was all about ETFs and dividend stocks. He called crypto a scam. He said he couldn't invest in a single stock unless they issued a fat dividend.

Then all of a sudden, he was a crypto bull and hyping up only growth stocks - Tesla, Meta, Paypal and even penny stocks! Until he sold them all last year.

I don't want to see this guy on CNBC again. I think they were contractually obligated to have him on due to him being on Shark Tank. At this point having him talking about stocks would be too toxic. He has no credibility left."

One of the highlights of the annual Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin. Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now. The brand with the second highest operating margin, BMW, is a few percentage points below Tesla’s +15% operating margin. Third-placed Daimler, at 10%, isn’t even close!

Get down to Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and it’s a different world.

Related to money is energy use, and one more thing Elon Musk pointed out in the shareholder meeting was that energy use per vehicle produced has come down — cutting emissions while saving money. From Tesla’s factory in California to its factory in Shanghai, the company has achieved a 17% reduction in energy use per vehicle."
145,These Are The Best (And Worst) Performing Stocks Of 2023,45,117wl8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/117wl8c/these_are_the_best_and_worst_performing_stocks_of/,12,1676961002.0," Driving stocks’ broad rebound over the first seven weeks of the year are several of last year’s black sheep, including Tesla, the always volatile electric vehicle company helmed by the U.S.’ second-richest man Elon Musk.

&#x200B;

 Tesla is the best-performing stock listed on the S&P 500 year-to-date, rising 69%, while the other five best-performing S&P constituents are streamer Warner Bros. Discovery (up 63%), biotechnology contractor Catalent (59%), orthodontics firm Align Technology (50%) and the cruise liner Royal Caribbean (48%), according to FactSet data.

Despite spanning industries, each of those companies have one thing in common: They were among the worst-performing stocks of 2022, each losing 35% or more last year.

Other notable gainers this year are fellow streamers Paramount (40%) and Disney (21%), Silicon Valley technology giants Nvidia (46%) and Meta (44%) and other leisure travel stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line (44%) and Caesars Entertainment (27%).

 

The S&P’s biggest losers are also a diverse group, led by telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies (-25%) and followed by solar energy company Enphase Energy (-23%), specialty healthcare provider Baxter International (-20%), energy company APA Corp (-18%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Pfizer (-15%).

The decline of Pfizer, by far the worst-performing stock of 2023 with a market capitalization over $100 billion, comes after the company [said](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/31/pfizer-expects-covid-vaccine-and-pill-revenues-will-fall-60-in-2023/?sh=7c9241f37bee) it expected sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and oral treatment will slip 60% in 2023, and headline an onslaught for several big pharmaceutical companies, with peers Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly down 9% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date.

 

KEY BACKGROUND

The S&P 500 is up 6.7% year-to-date after slipping 18% in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008. The slump closely tracked the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from around 0% to over 4% in an effort to slow inflation. In addition to Meta, other mega-cap tech stocks are up dramatically this year, with each of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft up 6% or more.

## TANGENT

Also gaining thus far in 2023 is bitcoin, up almost 50% year-to-date at about $25,000, an eight-month high. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam warned Monday that investors must be wary of the latest rally for the cryptocurrency, explaining: “We've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos,” referring to bitcoin’s dramatic 75% nosedive between November 2021 and November 2022.

## SURPRISING FACT

U.S. military contractor Northrop Grumman is the sixth-worst performing S&P constituent year-to-date, [despite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/02/15/chinese-spy-balloon-graphic-reminder-of-geopolitical-market-risks-heres-what-it-means-for-stocks/?sh=afd798e78889) a recent rally for it and other defense stocks as geopolitical tensions stewed.

## BIG NUMBER

$61.3 billion. That’s how much Musk has tacked onto his fortune so far this year during Tesla’s rally, roughly the size of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s total fortune. Musk, who lost his position as the world’s wealthiest person in December, is $15 billion away from reclaiming the title from LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

146,Tesla earnings preview: Wall Street braces for ‘difficult’ second quarter,45,w2uszl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2uszl/tesla_earnings_preview_wall_street_braces_for/,24,1658242786.0,"Tesla Inc. is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell, with Wall Street worried it will be a “difficult” quarter for the electric-vehicle maker amid ongoing supply-chain snags and pandemic-related factory shutdowns. “We fully expect a difficult (second quarter), based on continuing supply-chain issues and factory shutdowns,” said Bill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.

Tesla TSLA, 0.55% earlier this month reported a quarter-on-quarter fall in deliveries, its proxy for sales, leading some analysts to cut their expectations for the EV maker’s quarter. But some of the issues facing Tesla are already accounted for in Wall Street estimates, and investors are aware, Selesky said. He said he expects Tesla to “modestly” beat expectations thanks to reduced costs and relatively strong margins.

Dan Levy at Credit Suisse said the “key question” for investors next week will be “the magnitude of margin pressure from the Shanghai shutdown” due to China’s “COVID zero” policies. Levy said he expects margin recovery in the second half of the year as “Tesla ramps on volume.”

**Here’s what to expect:**

**Earnings:** Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share in the second quarter, which would compare with adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $2.05 a share for Tesla.

**Revenue:** The analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for sales of $16.54 billion for Tesla, which would compare with $12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize is expecting $17.1 billion in revenue for the quarter.

**Full story here-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-earnings-preview-wall-street-braces-for-difficult-second-quarter-11657823831?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-earnings-preview-wall-street-braces-for-difficult-second-quarter-11657823831?mod=home-page)"
147,Unusual options activity in Tesla stock shows a large investor taking a position,42,13xe16f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13xe16f/unusual_options_activity_in_tesla_stock_shows_a/,13,1685615575.0,"Two large tranches of Tesla (TSLA) stock options were traded on May 30: one a near-term in-the-money put position and the other a long-term way out-of-the-money call option. This unusual stock options activity is likely from a large investor.

The Unusual Stock Options Activity on May 30 showed that there were 13,039 put options traded at the $202.50 strike price for expiration on June 2, this Friday. The second tranche was for 13,064 call options traded at the $310 strike price for expiration on Oct. 20, 2023, 142 days from now.

**Large Calls And Puts In TSLA Stock**

The first tranche of options (puts) was in-the-money since the price of TSLA stock closed at $201.16 on Tuesday, May 16. The second tranche was way out-of-the-money (OTM) since the $310 call strike price is 54% higher than today's price. 

But interestingly, both had very similar prices. That's what makes me believe that both tranches were likely initiated together. For example, the puts closed at $5.45 per put contract, and the calls traded at $5.15 per call contract.

That implies that the investor may have gone long the puts and paid the $5.45 price, even though they only have $1.34 of intrinsic value (i.e., $202.50-201.16=$1.34). The reason is that they shorted the OTM calls and received $5.15 per call contract. That leaves a net cost of just 30 cents (i.e., $5.45-$5.15).   
  
So, in effect, the short-put investor has a profit of $1.04 in the long puts, as long as TSLA stock stays at $201.16 or lower. Meanwhile, they must figure the call options will wither over time unless TSLA stock rises by over 54% over the next 142 days (almost 4.75 months from now).

**Where TSLA Stock Stands Now**

Tesla stock is up over 22% so far in May and has risen 63.3% so far in 2023 since it closed at $123.18 at the end of 2022. Moreover, the company reported on April 19 that Q1 revenue rose 24% YoY compared to last year, although non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) fell 22%.   
  
However, analysts expect EPS to rise to $3.50 per share this year and $5.03 next year, up 43.7% by the end of 2024. This puts TSLA stock on a forward multiple of 40x for 2024, which is not that expensive.   
  
So, theoretically, TSLA stock could rise 54% by Oct 20, especially since by then analysts would have received the Q3 earnings report for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Nevertheless, that could be a reach. In other words, it's possible that the call options could potentially be worth $5.15 by Oct. 20.  
  
Nevertheless, there is a good possibility that TSLA might not be seen as undervalued given how far it has risen this year. That is likely what the investor who likely shorted these deep OTM calls is counting on.  
  
It also shows that the investor is likely more bearish on TSLA stock as they have, in effect, a large in-the-money put position that is mostly paid for by shorting the OTM calls. So investors who intend to copy these moves should be careful.  

**Another Interpretation**

Also, keep in mind that my interpretation of these tranches may not be correct. It is possible the investor went long on these OTM $310 strike price calls. They may have shorted the in-the-money puts with the hope that TSLA stock will rise in the next 2 days. That is they shorted the $202.50 puts, received $5.45 per contract, and turned around and used those proceeds to purchase the $310 strike price calls, paying $5.15 per contract for them.  
  
At least that way the long call position is more than paid for, with a net 30-cent credit (i.e., $5.45 from the short puts - $5.15 for the long OTM calls). And even if the $202.50 strike price puts are exercised, at least then the investor will own the TSLA shares at $202.50 (less 30 cents net credit). So then they will have a covered call position with the $310 OTM calls.  
  
Either way, you can see that a large investor has taken a big position in TSLA stock which is mostly bullish. You can decide if you want to copy them."

> # The Labor Market Remains Strong

> The December payroll report was yet another upside surprise as far as employment data go. Monthly payrolls rose by 223,000, above expectations for a 200,000 gain. The unemployment rate was expected to remain at 3.7% but fell to 3.5% – tying for the lowest rate since the 1950s. This is not remotely indicative of an impending recession. However, what matters for markets is how Federal Reserve (Fed) officials react to the strong employment data.

> As inflation falls, much focus is going to be on the employment picture since this is what is going to matter for the Fed. Especially since they are focused on wage growth being a driver of underlying inflation, i.e., services ex housing, as Chair Powell noted after the December FOMC meeting. In their minds, a softer employment picture is required for inflation to get close to its target of 2% and remain there. If not, they are going to need to see a significant and persistent decline in price data to be convinced that inflation is heading the right way. Only then are we likely to start seeing rate cuts.

> The “problem” is that a slew of recent data suggests the labor market remains far from soft. Let’s walk through four key data points.

> 1.) Strong job growth

> Job growth has slowed from more than half a million at the beginning of 2022 to just under 250,000 over the last three months of 2022. But make no mistake, this is still a very strong pace of job growth. As Powell has noted, the economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. And we’re more than double that currently.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-job-growth-600x800.png))**

> 1.) Labor demand still out-running supply

> Earlier this week, we got the November JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey), which showed that job openings remain elevated at 10.5 million. It was around 7 million before the pandemic. Powell’s favored metric is the vacancy ratio, which is the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers – that is currently at 1.7, down from 2.0 a few months ago but well above the pre-pandemic level of 1.2.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-vacancy-rate-597x800.png))**

> 1.) Elevated Quits

> The JOLTS data also showed that the rate at which workers voluntarily leave their jobs, i.e., the “quit rate,” remains elevated. For private sector workers, the quit rate had been declining over the past six months, but it rose to 3% in November, which is well above the pre-pandemic rate of 2.5-2.6%. This indicates that workers are confident enough to quit their jobs; often for jobs with greater pay – driving up wage growth. The Atlanta Federal Reserve finds that “job switchers” have seen much faster wage growth than “job stayers.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-quit-rate-600x800.png))**

> 1.) Low level of layoffs

> Initial claims for unemployment benefits, which is a leading employment indicator, closed out 2022 at 204,000 – the lowest level since September and a sign that layoffs remain low. Meanwhile, continued claims, which represent the number of unemployed workers who continue to receive benefits, remain steady at around 1.7 million. It has trended higher in recent months, indicating that unemployed workers are finding it a little harder to land a job as hiring slows, but the recent data don’t suggest anything alarming. In fact, the insured unemployment rate is at 1.2%, close to a record low. This measures the number of people currently receiving unemployment insurance benefits as a percentage of the labor force. It is a more useful and timely measure, as there is an observed action, i.e., filing for unemployment benefits, associated with being among the insured unemployed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-insured-unemployment-rate-603x800.png))**

> All the above points to a hot job market. Which is great by itself but not what the Fed wants to see. In short, it means the Fed is likely to keep rates higher for longer.

> # But wage growth is easing
> Here’s what is strange but certainly good news: Wage growth is showing signs of declining momentum even as the employment picture remains strong.

> Average hourly earnings for private workers rose at an annualized pace of 3.4% in December, which is only slightly above the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%. For “production or non-supervisory employees,” wage growth registered just 2.6%, well below the pre-pandemic pace of 3.4%. Non-managerial workers earn less income and tend to spend a greater portion of their income – faster wage growth for this group can potentially put upward pressure on prices. Monthly numbers can be noisy, but even the 3-month wage growth numbers clearly show declining momentum for all workers and for non-managerial workers. We’re yet to get to the pre-pandemic pace, but the trend is positive.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-06-wage-growth-600x800.png))**

> Ultimately, the “Goldilocks” scenario is this:

> * Strong employment growth
> * Wage growth eases
> * Inflation falls

> This is not what “theory” says should happen, but it is exactly what we’ve seen recently. We’ll take it. And if it continues, we believe it’ll only be a matter of time before the Fed takes notice.

> # Higher Claims on the Horizon?

> Unfortunately for equities, between a stronger-than-expected ADP payrolls number and stronger-than-expected jobless claims data, today's data showed some strength in the US labor market. Honing in on the weekly claims print, initial claims dropped all the way down to 204K this week. That marked a 19K decline from last week's 2K downwardly revised level of 223K and brings claims to the lowest level since the last week of September when we last saw a sub-200K print. Expectations were calling for the reading to go unchanged from the unrevised level of 225K from last week.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-1.png))**

> Even continuing claims improved falling to 1.694 million instead of the forecasted increase to 1.728 million. Last week's reading of 1.71 million had been the highest since February 2022 as continuing claims have steadily risen (at a pace consistent with past recessions) in the past several months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-2.png))**

> Although both initial and continuing claims had strong showings, there is the caveat that the current period was smack dab in the middle of the holidays. For starters, that could have some impact on the weekly seasonal adjustment, but more importantly, we would note that those are some of the weeks of the year most prone to revisions.

> In the chart below, we show the median revision (expressed as an absolute percent change from the first release) for each week of the year since 1997. The final week of the year has typically experienced a revision of +/-3.8%, tying the week of the July 4th holiday for the largest revision of the year. That means that while claims did show improvement this week, it might not be worth reading too deep into that single number. Further data will be beneficial to help confirm this print (via revisions or lack thereof) as well as provide a clearer picture of the trend, which had been one of deterioration leading into the end of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-Claims-3b.png))**

> One other slightly more anecdotal factor worth noting on the stronger-than-expected jobless claims data is that the strong reading this week has gone contrary to the number of layoffs that have made their way into headlines lately. Although the company initially announced the layoffs back in November, Amazon (AMZN) announced today that it plans to lay off a higher number of employees than previously stated (18K versus 10K originally). That also follows an announcement of a significant reduction of roughly 10% of the workforce of Salesforce (CRM) yesterday.

> Over the past few months, news story mentions (in data aggregated from Bloomberg) of things like job cuts, firings, and layoffs have surged reaching a high of 16.5K on a four-week rolling average basis in November (around the time of Amazon's initial announcement). Although that reading has pulled back in the several weeks since then, news counts on the topic remained elevated through the end of 2022 and are likely to get a further bump with this week's headlines. Over the past decade, these story counts have generally followed the path of both initial and continuing claims. More recently, however, there has been somewhat of a divergence with story counts far outpacing actual claims figures.

> That divergence could be for an array of reasons such as workers are quickly finding other roles and not needing to apply for unemployment insurance, but another thing to consider is the timing of the announcement of layoffs versus when they actually happen. For example, in the case of Amazon, while the initial announcement was all the way back in November, those cuts were not planned to go into effect until mid-January. In other words, while not in the data now, higher claims may very well be on the horizon.

> # China Emerges from zero-COVID: What’s Next?

> Happy new year! We’ve officially turned the page to 2023 and hope you and yours had a wonderful holiday season.

> As we closed out 2022, there were numerous major news topics, but one that picked up steam towards the year’s end was China’s assumed reopening after nearly three years of heavy restrictions. There were nationwide protests that started in November over the country’s zero-COVID policy, restrictions, and economic impact. The country started to ease many of the rules put into place. In December, they took a main health code app that tracked travel history offline and overhauled a lot of other limits that had been in place for a long time. This all implied an end to the strict zero-COVID approach.

> With the world’s second-largest economy opening back up, it makes sense to ask…what now?

> Inside China, they’ll have to grapple with rising cases and a health infrastructure that’s probably not as well-equipped to deal with a large outbreak as other Asian nations, like Japan and South Korea. Those countries had lower fatality rates upon reopening. That may not be the case for China, which has had low vaccination and booster rates for the elderly and relied on two domestic vaccines that have been less effective than the ones used by other nations. They’ll have to get better vaccines and import Paxlovid, the anti-viral pill. They’ll also need to increase adoption amongst those who haven’t gotten their jabs.

> Those should help, but there might be an adjustment period. It may take some time before Chinese citizens return to normal. Like in the US, some people may still be reluctant to be out and about with China opening up after nearly three years, but maybe they’ll welcome the reopening flexibility. Travel activity will be watched closely after China’s National Health Commission said there will be no quarantine for inbound travelers starting on January 8th. It may still be a couple of months before activity really takes off (thank you, thank you ).

> Infections could still cause labor shortages and supply chain issues. In place of full lockdowns, they may strongly encourage people who are sick to stay home. With cases rising in the last couple of months in Guangdong Province, which includes the major port city of Guangzhou, there could be supply chain issues in the near term. Tesla’s Shanghai factory was shut down this week with a spike in cases. Ultimately, there could be some starts and stops as the economy adjusts after a really long run of zero-COVID policy.

> Then there will be the 15-day Lunar New Year starting January 22nd, so there will be another slowdown…and hopefully not widespread virus spreading as people leave the cities and head home. That will slow down economic activity and could be another delay to international travel picking up, with Chinese citizens typically going home for the holiday.

> After a few months, this more relaxed approach to the virus should be positive for China, but also more broadly for supply chains to hopefully get closer to pre-pandemic activity levels. But, of course, there are always risks that China decides they need to crack down again.

> The Chinese equity market had a similar run to what was experienced in US stocks. Both sold off for much of the year, and each saw 2022 lows in October. Both saw a weakening in December. That being said, the CSI 300, an index of China’s largest 300 companies, saw a bigger bounce off lows despite the domestic unrest and sold off less in December.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SP500-and-China-CSI-300.png))**

> There is optimism for Chinese equities in 2023 as the economy gets back to normal, with some economists expecting a quick rebound. While ending the year down, the Q4 rally showed optimism in Chinese stock resiliency as Hong Kong-listed stocks rebounded by over 35% at one point. In the coming months, we’ll see if the optimism is on track or ahead of the economic recovery.

> For us in the US, hopefully, their economy opening up does help supply chains for businesses that have been slow to recover the last 2.5 years after everything ground to a halt. It will be interesting to see what the impact on inflation will be. Reopening means more spending on air travel, which could push prices up. There could also be more demand for raw materials and energy, which could keep inflation higher. We might see some benefit in other areas as supply chain constraints ease, so it very well could be a mixed bag.

> There’s also global concern about the impact of travelers from mainland China. As cases surge, there are limited data shared by Chinese authorities. Starting today (January 5th), the US will require a negative COVID test before departing. Japan is imposing similar measures.

> There will be a lot to watch in the new year. Speaking of, 2023 is the year of the rabbit in China. Chinese astrology says the rabbit is the symbol of patience and luck and follows the tiger, which tends to be more dramatic and tumultuous. Here’s to hoping this rabbit isn’t as frustrating as the ones that ruin my garden every year.

> # Bulls and Bears Back Off

> The S&P 500 has seen some choppy price action heading out of 2022 and into 2023, and that has seemed to have sent shivers down the spines of investors. Only 20.5% of respondents to the weekly sentiment survey run by AAII reported as bullish this week. That is down from 26.5% last week and is just shy of the recent low of 20.3% from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment dropped six percentage points week over week, there was not a shift to bearish sentiment as it also fell from 47.6% down to 42.0%. That is the lowest reading since December 8th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-2.png))**

> Given both bullish and bearish sentiment fell by similar amounts, the bull-bear spread moved down to -21.5, slightly below the previous week's reading of -21.1 and extending the record streak of negative bull-bear spread readings to 40 weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-3.png))**

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-4.png))**

> With both bullish and bearish sentiment falling, neutral sentiment surged to 37.5% which was the most elevated reading since the last week of March. Additionally, the 11.6 percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since a 12.6 percentage point surge in July 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-5.png))**

> Although that may sound like an impressive and notable jump, historically double-digit increases in neutral sentiment in just one week have been followed by somewhat 'meh' returns. Both average and median performance are worse than the norm albeit the index has moved higher more than half the time one month to one year out.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010523-AAII-8.png))**

> As the AAII survey continues to have an overarching negative tone, the same can be said for other surveys like the Investor's Intelligence and NAAIM readings. Combining all three of these into a composite, this week's reading was roughly 1 standard deviation below its historical average. While that implies sentiment is extremely bearish, that is only in the middle of the past year's range. Additionally, we would note that this composite has been negative (meaning these indicators in aggregate are more bearish than historically normal) for a full year. The only other time period since at least 2006 when that was also the case was in the 54 weeks ending June 2009.

> # Homebuilders Shrugging Off Mixed Data

> The national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has come well off its highs falling to 6.6% versus a high of 7.35% in early November. Despite the decline, mortgage rates remain at levels not seen since the early 2000s. We would also note that rates have gone on a series of wild swings in the past year. The second chart below shows the rolling 3-month change since 1998. Whereas most of the year saw rapid increases the likes of which have not been seen in the past quarter century, the current drop of 0.4 percentage points over the past few months has ranked as the largest since late 2020 and is just shy of a bottom decile reading of all periods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-1.png))**

> With mortgage rates giving buyers some relief, purchase applications had generally been on the rebound throughout November and December. However, the final week of 2022 saw a large reversal in purchase apps with a 12% week-over-week decline (potentially as a result of residual holiday seasonality) in the largest single-week decline since the last week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-2b.png))**

> While it is hard to say if the final week of 2022's large decline was seasonal or a return to purchase apps that are more consistent with readings from earlier in the fall, 2022 tended to follow seasonal patterns. The year began with applications around some of the strongest levels of the past decade and they continued to rise into peak housing season in the spring with applications hitting their pinnacle in the first week of May. The typical seasonal drift was then exacerbated by the added headwind of higher rates, and applications finished the year with the worst reading since 2014 for the comparable week of the year. Additionally, looking at the drop for each year from the annual high through 34 weeks later (second chart), 2022's percentage drop was the second largest since 1990 behind only the 75.7% decline in 2013.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-4.png))**

> Refinance applications have continued to hit new lows as this week saw yet another decline down to the lowest level since May 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/010423-MBA-5.png))**

> Even though there are some silver linings in recent data, housing activity remains weak. Homebuilder stocks continue to look past that though and continue to shrug off much of the broader market choppiness. The past week has seen the homebuilders, proxied by the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), rally 3.25%. That has largely erased the mean reversion from the second half of December and brings the ETF right up to resistance at the mid-August highs.

> # Average Isn’t So Average When It Comes To Investing

> “There was a statistician, and he stuck his head in a bucket of ice and feet in the oven. They asked him how he felt, and he replied, ‘about average.’”

> Old statistics joke.

> First, I wish everyone a happy 2023 and hope you had a great holiday season with family and friends!

> I love using that joke above in a presentation, as it always gets a good laugh. But there is something to it, especially when looking at stock returns. The truth is that average returns aren’t so average, while larger moves happen more than we probably expect.

> If you go back to 1950, the S&P 500 is up 9.1% on average. So let’s say that an average year for an investor is between 8 and 10%. Sounds fair, right? Incredibly, stocks have gained between 8 and 10% only four times (or 5.5% of the time)! The years that hit the average market were 1959, 1965, 2004, and 2016. That’s incredible if you ask me, as I would have assumed we’d have a few more in that average range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-127.png))**

> This tells us one thing: larger moves are more likely to happen, and the good news is that most of the big moves historically have happened to the upside. This time I looked at all the 20% gains since 1950 and found 20. This comes out to an impressive 27.4% of all years’ gains of at least 20%. I do this for a living, and I point this out each year, but it still somewhat surprises me.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-260.png))**

> What about the negative years? Or, more specifically, the large negative years?

> * There have only been three 20% losses, and those were in 1974, 2002, and 2008. But, of course, last year just barely missed this dubious feat.
> * Five years lost at least 15%, and 12 years lost at least 10%.

> What about 10% moves up or down? 51 years saw stocks either gain or lose at least 10% (39 up and 12 down). That is 69.9%% of all years see a move of greater than 10%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-351.png))**

> As the great Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes once said, “Statistics remind me of the fellow who drowned in a river where the average depth was only three feet.”

> Investors need to take Woody’s advice and remember that averages are important, but there is usually a lot more to the whole story. The bottom line is we could gain between 8 and 10% this year, but the odds favor it’ll likely be a good deal, more or less. I know it is a lonely call, but we are in the camp. It may be more, which we will discuss in our Outlook 2023 next week.

> # January Weaker Last 21 Years

> Recent January weakness can be seen in the chart. January has on average started out positive with DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 all logging gains in the first half of the month, but weakness then creeps in. From around the seventh trading day to the end of the month declines have prevailed over the last 21 years.

151,Lyft stock analysis and valuation - Why it is down almost 90%,42,11vwcq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11vwcq0/lyft_stock_analysis_and_valuation_why_it_is_down/,28,1679257056.0,"This post summarizes my analysis of Lyft. 

I hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to add your take and agree/disagree with what's mentioned below.

&#x200B;

The post is divided into the following sections:

* Introduction
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* The main problem
* Assumptions & valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

Those who are in the US are for sure familiar with Lyft. How I'd describe it in one sentence, is ""Uber's little brother"". 

It offers a ride-sharing marketplace, but also vehicles for hire, motorized scooters, bicycle sharing, and other services related to transportation.

The company became public back in March 2019, which means within 4 years, its share price got a significant haircut (down almost 90%). The market cap is close to $4 billion.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

One thing that is in common for most companies that have gone public is:

\- They have a big story that grabs the attention of the investors (and makes them feel that if they don't invest, they'd be missing out)

\- They have had a good financial performance for the last few years

Lyft was no different. Take a look at the revenue growth prior to the IPO:

2017 - 209%

2018 - 103% (reaching almost $2.2 billion in revenue)

What can one expect from a such high-growth company in the future? Probably something comparable, right? Well, between 2018 and 2022, the revenue grew at CAGR (""Compounded annual growth rate"") of 17%. Here's the breakdown:

2019 - 68% (Still good!)

2020 - negative 35% (due COVID-19)

2021 - 36%

2022 - 28% (reaching almost $4.1 billion in revenue)

Of course, we can point to COVID-19 for the disruption of revenue growth, but the average analysts' forecast is 10% revenue growth in the coming years.

So we have a company that started with a big growth story which is no longer there.

To make things a bit worse, the gross margin of 40% isn't sufficient to cover the operating expenses that are close to double the gross margin. This means Lyft needs to cut its operating expenses in half only to break even. Are they making progress on that topic? Let's take a look at the operating expenses as % of revenue in 2018 (prior to the IPO and COVID-19) and 2022:

Operations and support: Decreased from 16% --> 11%

Research and development: Increased from 14% --> 21%

Sales & Marketing: Decreased from 37% --> 13%

General & Administrative: Increased from 21% --> 31%

**Total: Decreased from 88% to 76%**

This seems all over the place, some expenses are better managed, others a bit worse. Again, as mentioned above, they need to reduce to 40% only for Lyft to break even.

The company is yet to find its way to profitability and for the year 2022, its operating margin was -36%. From its operations, Lyft was losing over $1bn/year! For comparison, its market cap is under $4 billion now.

Of course, this is where share-based compensation comes into play. A big chunk of the operating expenses, related to the employees and the management was paid in shares. In fact, since 2018, the # of shares outstanding has increased by 32%! If we use the share price back at the time when these shares were earned, that amounts to $3.5 billion only in the last 4 years.

The # of shares outstanding has been increasing between 5% and 10% every year!

If the employees and the management do not believe in Lyft, they're going to sell these shares, which brings the price down even more.

If we adjust for this non-cash expense, Lyft is losing around $300 million from its operations.

&#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

One of the questions that always arise in money-losing companies is ""Is this company going bankrupt?"".  

I don't think this is likely to happen in the next few years. Lyft has cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments of over $2.8 billion, while the total debt (including leases) is around $1 billion. This net cash position is sufficient to sustain the losses for quite some time.

&#x200B;

**The main problem**

We have a company that is struggling to find its path to profitability and doesn't have huge growth ahead. So what can the management do? Oh yes, a LOYALTY program! This is oftentimes the proposed solution to such a problem for a company that is in a competitive environment. But this actually highlights the real problem within the ride-sharing industry.

There's absolutely no stickiness. If I put myself in the shoes of a customer or a driver, why would I use Lyft (or Uber) if another company offers better prices? There's nothing stopping customers or drivers to switch from one company to the other at moment.

Yes, a loyalty program sounds good, but it isn't free. Any discount would lead to retaining customers, but it also means less revenue for the company. Ultimately, Lyft would be the one paying that price, which doesn't help its journey to profitability.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions and valuation**

For anyone that doesn't see a company becoming profitable, well, there makes no sense to go through the exercise of running a DCF valuation. I am going to run this exercise as there are always readers with different views than mine. I'll start with one scenario:

1. **Revenue**: Growing at 10% for the next 5 years, then declining to 3% by year 10 (This leads to revenue doubling in 10 years time)
2. **Operating margin**: Break-even at year 5, increasing to 8% by year 10
3. **Discount rate**: 11.61% --> Reducing to 9.94% as time goes by and the company becomes profitable

After adjusting for everything that's on the balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options, the outcome is close to **$1.8 billion ($4.7/share)**

This is roughly half of the current market cap of $3.8 billion ($10.60/share).

&#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

 Let's take a look at how the valuation changes if we use different assumptions (also, under which assumptions the company is fairly valued today).

Below is a table that shows the fair value per share, based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|12%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|75% ($7.2b)|$3.4|$4.6|$5.9|$6.9|
|100% ($8.2b)|$3.3|$4.7|$6.0|$7.7|
|150% ($10.2b)|$3.2|$4.7|$7.0|$9.7|
|200% (12.3b)|$2.6|$5.4|$8.2|$11.4|

At today's share price of roughly $10.60/share, to be fairly valued, Lyft needs to grow its revenue by 150-200% in 10 years' time and reach an operating margin of 12%.

The big story that evolves around autonomous driving and the idea that Lyft will be able to capitalize on that is still there. However, they're not the only company that is aiming at that. It's not only its big brother Uber as well. There's Tesla, other car manufacturers, and Apple/Amazon are always there to jump at an opportunity.

As always, thank you for reading the posts, and until next week for the next valuation."
152,Is F a bad stock to own in the long-term?,37,xpme7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xpme7w/is_f_a_bad_stock_to_own_in_the_longterm/,96,1664298270.0,"

I'm tempted to buy more to bring down my avg price  but it keeps dipping !

Today seemingly there was some good news that Ford is investing 700 mill in a Kentucky truck plant, creating jobs, and somehow the stock dipped 2% ? 

It seems like it's just been moving in lockstep with SPY. 

Someone has told me Ford is in a mountain of debt because of their transition to electric, but cant read a balance sheet. 

I figured they pay a good dividend and with the high demand of the f150 lightning, they're well positioned to compete with Tesla for US market, and their valuation is down to earth. 


What are your thoughts on this boomer stock ?"

156,RIVIAN vs Chinese EV Stocks ?,38,10ulquf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10ulquf/rivian_vs_chinese_ev_stocks/,39,1675627004.0,"Why is Rivian so slow in scaling 

2021 - 1000 deliveries
2022 - 22,000 deliveries
2023 - ???

On the other side we have Chinese EVs like BYD, XPENG, NIO delivering 200,000 cars yearly and they are planning to enter US in couple of years.

Are there any other pure US bases EV companies (besides Tesla and Rivian) ?"
157,Help me with the math on TSLA supercharging,32,14f4h1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14f4h1k/help_me_with_the_math_on_tsla_supercharging/,83,1687344973.0,"Lots of hype lately about the NACS plug standard adoption. Yes, it’s a good thing to have one type of plug across most/all cars.  Yes, it will potentially generate more revenue for Tesla by increasing demand at super charger stations.  However, I am seeing incredibly high $billion dollar revenue numbers getting thrown around like candy.  Knowing the realization of this NACS adoption is years away and that Tesla has something like 17000 stations in the USA, let’s do some math:

Assuming each charger is active everyday for 1 year and they are fully utilized at 24 times per day. At their charge rate I was told by others that each charge generates about $25 per.  I think I am being very optimistic and conservative.  

So, I get to about $3.7/3.8B per year in Revenue (not earnings). 

If Tesla in 5 years doubled that 17000 in US then of course double that revenue number.  

Again, lots of assumptions and fairly optimistic and conservative.  

Where do all these so called expert analysts get their wild revenue numbers?   I have seen $10B plus in revenue by 2030 and $100B plus by xxxx.

Are they assuming that the rest of the world will also use Tesla super chargers at this same rate?   Tesla will have no competition for charging?   That EVs will dominate the car industry in next 5-10 years?   Etc.

OK, let’s throw in all 40000 chargers world wide and using same estimates we are $8.8B per year.  Again, huge assumptions into the far off future.  

Aren’t the Tesla market cap increases after all these announcements ridiculous?  Are analysts intentionally misleading investors with their unrealistic expectations for the next 5-10 years?  Are investors blinded by the momentum trade?   Is this another meme moment?  

What am I missing?"

With this information, I introduce to you..... The Reddit's Over Priced Index!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats\_the\_most\_over\_priced\_stock/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats_the_most_over_priced_stock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Here's how it works. Every ticker was 1 vote for that company. Each vote takes up a portion of the portfolio so more votes for one company means that company will take up more space (EX. TSLA had 8 votes whereas SPCE had one so Tesla takes up 8 times as much space). Every vote counted - so even if I disagreed, I can't remove any votes. The votes are closed so sorry to all that didn't get the chance but not to worry because the portfolio will either be updated quarterly or semi-annually depending on how lazy I am.

The real 2 things we're trying to find out:

1. Are these stocks really driven by Hype and overpriced?
2. Can you out-preform the index? (check the future updates to see if you can!)

&#x200B;

Without further ado, here are the holdings! (Ordered from most votes to least).

There are 37 stocks with a total of 65 votes. The number that follows the ticker is the percentage (%) it holds in the portfolio

In an interview with Reuters last week, PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell stated all of its trucks were of the 500-mile variety, not the shorter-range 300-mile trucks, and they planned on using them for seven years (one million miles). He also confirmed that savings over the cost of operating conventional big rigs would pay them back over that duration.

O'Connell went on to outline the company is moving Frito-Lay ""food products"" on routes within a 425-mile range, while trucks carrying the heavier PepsiCo soda cans were confined to shorter routes within 100 miles. He did confirm that after hitting the 425-mile mark, there was still about a 20% charge on the battery, and it took approximately 35 to 45 minutes to recharge fully.

It makes sense for the company to take things slow to test out the capabilities of its new Semis. The other thing to consider is how PepsiCo and Frito-Lay set up their intrastate distribution systems. Perhaps soda products are stored and routed differently than lighter food products.

Oliver Dixon, a senior analyst at the consulting firm Guidehouse, thinks Tesla still has ""a lot to prove"" to commercial distribution fleets because ""dragging a trailer full of chips around is not the most intense, tough ask."""

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline.
*****
> Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop.
*****
> Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence.
*****
> “If you’re afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,” Sri-Kumar Global’s Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. “Equities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don’t trust [Friday’s] rally.”
*****
> Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward.
*****
> Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January’s blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month.
*****
> On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That’s compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.

Meanwhile, Tesla is ramping up end-of-quarter vehicle delivery incentives.

Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management sold 73,113 shares of Tesla Friday for around $19.05 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 260.54. Friday's Tesla sell-off was done through ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).  
  
Tesla stock recorded two tiny losses and ended a record 13-day win streak last week. However, on Friday shares rose to a fresh eight-month high. Ahead of Tuesday's trade, TSLA was up more than 70% over the past seven weeks, but still short — down around 17% — of September highs.  
  
Cathie Wood has been buying up Tesla on the cheap throughout 2023 before selling big in recent days.

On June 12, Wood sold off more than 393,000 shares of Tesla for around $98.2 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 249.83. Cathie Wood's funds purchased more than 1.3 million TSLA shares so far in 2023 and have now sold around 730,000 shares.

Tesla stock jumped 5.3% to 274.31 Tuesday during market trade.

# Final Push For Vehicle Deliveries

Tesla increased discounts on U.S. inventory Model S and Model X vehicles by $2,500 late Friday. Consumers can now get $7,500 off the luxury models after the EV company originally implemented a $5,000 price cut a few weeks ago.  
  
Meanwhile, days after Tesla increased U.S. Model Y all-wheel drive prices by $250, the company now offers discounts of around $500 on some inventory vehicles.  
  
Tesla also appears to be trying to move Model 3 inventory. Last week, the automaker began offering customers who order a Model 3 between June 14 and June 30 three months of unlimited free supercharging, according to the company's website.  
  
In China, Tesla is offering insurance subsidies on Model 3 vehicles. From June 16 to June 30, customers in China who buy and complete delivery of an in-inventory Model 3 rear-wheel drive vehicle will be eligible for an insurance subsidy of about $1,120.  
  
In China last week, Tesla sold 14,500 vehicles, down 12% from the 16,400 vehicles sold in the previous week.  
  
Through June 18, Tesla sold 40,600 vehicles in China, leading sales among ""premium brands"" in the country.

Shares are up around 140% in 2023 and nearly 28% in June. However, Tesla stock is down around 37% from the all-time high of 414 it hit in November 2021.  
  
TSLA jumped more than 6% last week despite two straight consecutive sessions with losses.  
  
Tesla stock is well extended past a 207.79 buy point from what's either a cup or a double-bottom base.  
  
Shares are more than 30% above their 200-day/40-week moving average. That's the most extended they've been since the stock marked its peak in November 2021."
163,Porsche IPO and VW Valuation,33,xlu87t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xlu87t/porsche_ipo_and_vw_valuation/,16,1663930386.0,"So the Porsche IPO will likely happen by the end of the month despite the pessimistic state the global markets seems to be currently in \[1\].
&#x200B;

VW is targeting around 75 billion euros, they will also keep 75% of the shares and are planning to pay out 49% of the proceeds as a special dividend to current shareholders by the end of the year (if my calculations are correct that should be around  €15 per share).

However currently VOW3 is trading at \~145 which besides a slump to the 120s in early July is around the price they have been at since March (and the status and timing of the IPO wasn't that clear during most of this period). At current prices the 75% share of Porsche VW will retain should be worth around 51 billion meaning that the rest of VW would only be valued at approximately 28 billion?

Now VW has massive amounts of debt, Porsche is it's most profitable subsidiary, VOW3 has outperformed DAX since July and Porsche share price might collapse after the IPO but does that really seem like a fair valuation for VW?

Even without Porsche it would still maintain fairly decent fundamentals compared to it's competitors. VW seems to be ahead of most other legacy car makers in EV, according to units shipped it should be second after Tesla this year and based on some some estimates [2] it might even ship more cars than Tesla by 2024/25 (even if that won't happen they are still showing pretty decent YoY growth). If the special dividend is mostly priced in that would bring down VOW3 to €128 which around what it would be trading at if it followed the DAX PERFORMANCE-INDEX after July (but it would still be considerably underperforming it YTD, currently they are both around 20% down YTD).

Also Porsche itself seems to be in a great position to challenge Tesla higher end models (especially in markets outside of NA) as long as VW is successful at scaling up it's EV production: The Taycan is priced competitively compared to Model S and and their upcoming EV SUV should be able to compete with Model X as well.

Buying Porsche at the IPO price is probably not best idea as a retail investor, but what about VOW3(VWAPY in the US)?  Or is VW actually worth less than Stellantis, GM, Ford or even BMW when Porsche is subtracted from it?

# **S&P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
> The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
> The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed’s efforts to fight it.
*****
> “The economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier & Associates.
*****
> “You just can’t win right now on macro numbers,” he added. “That is why it’s now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.”
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
> Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors’ hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
> For December, the S&P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

> # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan’s (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

> The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ’s approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

> For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ’s rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

> The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ’s newly set implicit cap.

> # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
> Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ’s decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dollar-vs-Yen.png))**

> # A Preview of Things to Come?
> The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen’s depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan’s new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

> This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We’ll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

> # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

> As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

> About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

> This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

> # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

> Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

> Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

> # Day After Christmas NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

> Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

> It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

> NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

> Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

> Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

> # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

> “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”
—Yale Hirsh

> One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn’t the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

> Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

> Here’s a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

> These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn’t been higher seven years in a row since the ‘70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&P 500 does after each.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

> The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn’t come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

> Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren’t very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn’t right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn’t a strategy, but I’m hoping for some green during the SCR!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

> Finally, the average gains each year for the S&P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn’t ignore either.

> # Don’t Lose Faith Yet

> Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

> We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I’ll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

> As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

> # No Worse Year for Sentiment

> The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

> With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

> As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

> With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

> In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

> # Malaise Among Individual Investors

> The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

> As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

> # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

> As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

> Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

> For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

# **Earnings could be an even bigger catalyst for stocks after the market’s wild ride on rate fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/15/earnings-could-be-an-even-bigger-catalyst-for-stocks-after-the-markets-wild-ride-on-rate-fears.html)**
*****
> Investors are likely to switch their focus to earnings season, after the market’s wild ride on rising and falling expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes.
*****
> Stocks were volatile in the past week. The three major indexes posted sharp gains Friday, after worries the Fed would raise rates by a full point this month faded. Still, stocks notched weekly losses, with the S&P 500 was down nearly a percent at 3,863.16.
*****
> A surprise 9.1% year-over-year jump in June consumer inflation Wednesday drove speculation the Fed would be willing to battle rising prices by going beyond the three-quarter point hike, anticipated on July 27.
*****
> But by Friday, comments from Fed officials, a surprise 1% gain in June retail sales, and some better data on consumer inflation expectations reversed those expectations in the futures market.
*****
> “It really was a great study in mob psychology. We went into the week with a 92% chance it was a 75 basis point hike, and we exited Wednesday with an 82% chance it was going to be 100 basis points,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. A hundred basis points is equal to one percentage point.
*****
> By Friday, strategists said there was just about a 20% chance for a 100 basis point hike priced into the market.
*****
> In the coming week, earnings news could set the tone as a diverse group of companies report. Big banks continue with reports Monday, with releases from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Johnson & Johnson, Netflix and Lockheed Martin post results on Tuesday. Tesla and United Airlines issue their quarterly figures Wednesday. AT&T, Union Pacific and Travelers are among those reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon both release earnings Friday.
*****
> Besides earnings, there are a few key data releases, mostly around housing. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index will post on Monday. Housing starts are out Tuesday, and existing home sales are due Wednesday. On Thursday, there is the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey. Finally, both manufacturing and services PMI are released on Friday.
*****
> “Every data point matters and also what companies are saying. Next week... it’s a much broader picture in terms of earnings and the economy,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “If there are negative revisions and mounting concerns from the guidance, I think then you are going to see questions as to how the Fed is going to interpret that…The other point is whether or not the market can build off today’s rally.”
*****
> # Earnings expectations
> Strategists have been expecting the second-quarter earnings season to contain disappointments and downward revisions, as companies deal with inflation, supply chain issues, staff shortages — and now a slower economy.
*****
> “We can shift to earnings and that will take up all the oxygen in the room. There’s a possibility this is where the market could make some traction,” said Hogan. “We haven’t really heard from anybody but big banks. There’s a chance that expectations are so low, and the narrative around guidance is that it’s going to have to come down. If it doesn’t, there’s a chance we’ll see a positive reaction to that.”
*****
> Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to gain 5.6%, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. As of Friday morning, 35 S&P companies had reported, and 80% of those reported earnings above forecasts, Refinitiv found.
*****
> Hogan noted that by the end of earnings season, companies usually beat at a 65% pace. “It’s just a function of keeping your guidance. The same guidance is going to be good enough,” he said. “We saw that with PepsiCo first out of the gate, leaving the forward guidance the same, and the stock was applauded for that. That could be the norm, rather than the exception.”
*****
> Krosby said investors will also be watching housing data, after the rapid jump in mortgage rates.
*****
> “It is a litany of real estate focus, which is important because we want to see how the housing market is holding up,” she said. “It’s a focus for the Fed to slow down the housing market. We’ll see how that unfolds.”

> # S&P 500 Performance Before, During and After Recessions

> A recession has widely been defined by many economists as two consecutive quarters of decline in GDP. Whether or not you are a glass half-full or half-empty person, Q1 U.S. GDP was negative which does satisfy half of that definition. More recently the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model’s estimate for Q2 U.S GDP is also negative. In an effort to gain a better understanding of the market’s performance before, during and after recessions we have compiled the following table.

> Dates for U.S recessions were sourced from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Since 1945, there have been 13 U.S. recessions. The most recent and shortest was the result of Covid-19 and began in February 2020 and ended two months later in April. The longest recession post WWII was caused by financial crisis in 2008-2009 and lasted 18 months. The average duration of a recession has been 10.2 months.

> Historically, in the 1-year period prior to the start of the recession, S&P 500 has been positive 53.8% of the time with an average gain of 4.12%. In the table above, the year before the recession began is calculated using monthly closes. For example the 1-year prior to the Covid-19 recession was calculated using the close from January 2019 through the close of January 2020. During recessions S&P 500 historically advanced 46.2% of the time but with an average loss of 1.22%. Once the recession ended S&P 500 generally tended to soar 14.45% on average higher over the next year with gains occurring 84.6% of the time.

> # Short Interest Keeps Rising

> Over the past few days, equities, including the most heavily shorted stocks, have reversed a good amount of the gains seen since the mid-June lows. A basket of the 100 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 3,000 is currently little changed versus its levels at the start of 2020 compared to a roughly 16% gain for the Russell 3000. Whereas heavily shorted stocks saw massive outperformance versus the broader market in the second half of 2020 and early 2021, that outperformance has unwound since last fall. More recently over the past two months, though, highly shorted stocks and the Russell 3000 have been performing more or less in line with each other as the relative strength line has trended sideways and is near similar levels to the COVID Crash.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-SIPF-1.png))**

> The most recent short interest data as of the end of June was also updated in the past 24 hours. For the whole of the Russell 3000, the average reading on short interest as a percentage of float currently stands at 6.24%. That is up 20 basis points since the prior update for mid-June and a full percentage point higher versus the start of the year.

> Across nearly all industry groups, there have been major shifts in short interest levels since the start of the year. While most have made considerable moves higher, there are others that have actually fallen significantly like Food & Staples Retail and Telecommunication Services. Given the big increases this year, Retail continues to have the highest average reading on short interest followed by the Pharmaceuticals, Biotech &Life Sciences, and the automobile industries. Although their levels of short interest are not as elevated, Software & Services and Energy stocks saw the largest increases from the last report while only the Media & Entertainment industry and Food & Staples Retailing stocks saw declines in average short interest between the two most recent reports. That being said, none of those sequential moves were particularly large with the biggest absolute move being the 0.45 percentage point increase in Software & Services.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-SIPF-2.png))**

> Switching over to the individual stocks with the highest levels of short interest, Dillard's (DDS) currently tops the list with a little more than half of its shares sold short. That reading is only half of a percentage point higher versus mid-June but has nearly doubled since the start of the year. Although it continues to sit near the top of the list, Redbox Entertainment (RDBX), has perhaps seen the most notable shift in levels of short interest versus the last bi-weekly report. Throughout the year, the recent has seen large swings in its reported short interest levels.

> # NASDAQ Midyear Rally Fizzles and Bears Not Expected to Hibernate Until Late Q3/Early Q4

> On the heels of one of the roughest first half starts in decades; the market had found some footing during the seasonally bullish start to the second half of the year here in the beginning of July. Even during historically meager midterm years, the first half of July has generated respectable gains. However much like the first half of the year, typical first half of July strength appears to have come to an end. After briefly entering positive territory, NASDAQ’s midyear rally is now a bust down 2.3% at today’s close with only two days remaining in the 12-day span.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4d9f1ff40bf609de63c5210bf9b83511/bbc53449c9f2074f-a5/s540x810/b89748db4ac85b49410d064508152c9414c47eb8.jpg))**

> As you can see in the updated S&P 500 seasonal pattern chart, through today’s close above, S&P 500 has rolled over and appears to be tracking the sideways trading action in in “All Midterm Years” and “Democratic President Midterm” years. We still believe this bear market will put in a typical midterm-election-year bottom sometime later this year. The bottom is most likely to be in the August-October timeframe just ahead of the midterm elections and possibly around the time when the Fed begins to signal that it may slow or even pause its rate hike cycle.

> # Bulls Back Above 25%

> In spite of the S&P 500's consistent declines in the past week as it failed to take out its late June highs, investor sentiment has turned around (relatively speaking) with this week's reading from the AAII showing 26.9% of respondents reporting as bullish for the first time since early June. The 7.5 percentage point increase in the percentage of bullish responses this week was a large week-over-week increase by historical standards, although there have been multiple even bigger larger weekly increases over the past few months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-1.png))**

> With the increase in bullish sentiment, over a quarter of respondents reported as bullish for the first time in five weeks. Such extended streaks with as depressed readings have been few and far between with the last five-week streak occurring all the way back in the summer of 1993. Overall, there have now only been six streaks in which bullish sentiment remained below 25% for at least 5 consecutive weeks. The longest of these was in December 1990 when it went on for 9 weeks in a row. Albeit a small sample size, historically the end of these streaks have not been raging buy signals for the S&P 500 in the short term with inline performance versus all periods and somewhat weak returns one month out. However, three, six, and twelve months later the S&P 500 has been higher almost every time with slightly stronger than normal performance (six months out from the March 1990 occurrence was the only decline).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-5.png))**

> The increase in bullish sentiment was met by bears falling back below 50% to 46.5%. Mirroring bullish sentiment, that made for the lowest reading since the first week of June.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-2.png))**

> As a result of those moves, the bull-bear spread remains firmly in favor of bears. With the percentage of bearish responses outnumbering bulls by 19.6 points, for the 15th week in a row the bull-bear spread remains negative. That steak has grown to be the third largest on record behind a 22-week streak ending in late 1990 and a 34-week streak ending in October 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071422-AAII-3a.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has managed to avoid major shifts in sentiment in recent weeks and this week was no exception. This reading fell modestly from 27.8% to 26.6%. That is well within the range of the past couple of years' readings and is only the lowest since three weeks ago.

> # More Burning on Hot Inflation

> For most of the session yesterday, the S&P 500 was having trouble choosing a direction, but come the final hours of trading with a CPI release looming, the index took a decisive turn lower. Given rampant hot inflation over the past couple of years and its implications for changes to monetary policy, that sort of late day selling ahead of CPI prints has been the norm as shown below. On average for the past two years, the day before CPI releases has typically seen the S&P 500 trade higher for most of the session before turning lower and erasing its gains in the afternoon; just as we saw yesterday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-1.png))**

> With another hotter than expected print this morning for both headline and core measures of inflation, yesterday's late day sellers seem to have been on the right side of the trade as the S&P 500 has fallen further and is on pace for the sixth drop on a CPI print in a row. Taking a look at intraday price action of the S&P 500 on CPI release days, historically there has been a downward bias with all releases since 2000 averaging a drop of a few basis points by the close. Over the past two years it has been far worse with an average decline of 28 bps. Most of that drop has actually occurred after a bout of midday selling.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-2.png))**

> Using data from our Economic Indicator Database, filtering out for only times in which CPI has come in above expectations (on a month over month basis), that same pattern is apparent. The S&P 500 tends to trade in the red for most of the morning but the worst declines occur in the early afternoon before some stabilizing into the close.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-CPI-3.png))**

> In response to today's hotter than anticipated release, the S&P 500 gapped down 1.2% which ranks as the fourth worst gap down for the index on a CPI day since at least 2000. Going back over the past two decades, there have only been a total of seven gaps down of 1% or more on a CPI day. Including today, four of those releases have occurred this year: February (-1.2%), March (-1%), June (-1.64%), and today (-1.23%). Taking a look at the intraday pattern of the S&P 500 across those 1% or larger gaps, the index has tended to continue to fall throughout the session with the lows of the day tending to occur around 2:30 EST with modest sideways action into the close from there.

> # This Isn't Normal

> With inflation running out of control and markets furiously attempting to re-price Federal Reserve interest rate policy, we're seeing some truly wild moves in the fixed income markets. This week, the big moves have come at the short-end of the Treasury yield curve as three-month Treasury yields have surged by 35 basis points this week alone. While the 2y10y US Treasury yield curve has been inverted for seven trading days now, the 3m10y curve, which is the FOMC's preferred measure of the yield curve, has remained positively sloped, but the rate of flattening has really picked up in recent days and since early May has gone from around 225 bps to under 75 bps today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-Curves.png))**

> As mentioned above, the bulk of the flattening in the 3m10y curve has occurred more recently. The chart below shows the 20-day rate of change in the 3m10y US Treasury yield curve since 1962. The red line indicates the threshold for 100 bps of flattening in a four-week span which is where we are at now. Prior to the current period, there wasn't a similar flattening of the 3m10y curve in a four-week span since the Financial Crisis. In August 2011, the rate of flattening got close to 100 bps in a four-week span but came up just shy. In other words, these types of moves in the yield curve don't happen very often.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/071322-Four-week-change.png))**

> How often are they? The chart below shows the distribution of four-week changes in the 3m10y yield curve over time grouped into 20 bps increments. Including the last few days, where we are at in the current period (-100 to -120 bps of flattening in a four-week span) has only occurred on 77 trading days, and there have only been a total of 223 trading days where the yield curve flattened by 100 bps or more in a four-week period. On a percentage basis, that works out to less than 1.5% of all trading days. When it comes to markets, it seems as though there's always something unique happening out there, and these days, you don't see what's happening at the short end of the Treasury curve very often.

*****

> # Another Curve Inverts

> As of today, the percentage of inverted points on the yield curve reached the YTD highs seen in mid-June of 17.9%. This comes as the 10-year and 1-year invert, as well as the 5-year and 2-year. The inversion of points on the yield curve (particularly 2s&10s) tends to be cited as a leading recession indicator, due to the fact that higher near-term yields imply a higher risk in the near-term rather than the long-term, the inverse of what is typically true. The graph below shows the rolling percentage of inverted points on the curve over the last six months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/07/Yield-Curve-Inversions-071222.png))**

> As mentioned above, the spread between the 10-year and 1-year treasury inverted today, which is the first occurrence since October of 2019. Following prior inversions of this part of the yield curve since 1970, a recession has followed in the next two years 99.8% of the time which would suggest that a recession at some point in the next two years is almost certain. Following the first inversion in at least one year when a recession did follow, it has taken an average of 271 trading days to officially enter a recession. The shortest time it took to enter into a recession following 1s and 10s inversion was in 1973, when it took just 191 trading days. As mentioned, going back to 1970, recessions have followed within two years of an inversion 99.8% of the time. The only time that this part of the curve inverted and a recession did not follow within two years was after a brief stint in the fall of 1998.

166,Can TSLA put together a comeback after earnings?,30,10mdugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10mdugd/can_tsla_put_together_a_comeback_after_earnings/,105,1674799698.0,"Strong Q4 earnings and the possibility of producing up to 2 million cars this year helped add to Tesla’s recent gains. The stock closed nearly 11% higher on Thursday after already breaking the downtrend resistance stemming back to September at the start of the week. 

The gap higher does leave some room for a pullback on profit-taking from here, especially if Friday’s inflation data raises bets for a hawkish Fed decision next week. However, trading volume has been relatively higher around the recent lows, including Monday's breakout, potentially signalling strong demand at the current levels. 

All trading involves risk, but the stock could begin a more sustained rebound if the strong earnings report, and Elon Musk’s comments on demand and output attracts longer-term investors."
167,"""Is the AI-led 'F*cking Baby Bubble' Bursting? BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.""",31,14hhtr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14hhtr6/is_the_ailed_fcking_baby_bubble_bursting_bofa/,24,1687576263.0,"The current AI-led ""baby bubble"" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.

On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.

Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led ""baby bubble"" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.

What lessons can be learned from the dot-com bubble that could be applied to the current AI stock boom?"

169,On Tesla's valuation (Part 4),27,10sk1gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/,21,1675430093.0,"In the past I've made multiple posts on Tesla's valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/)).

Previously I did them after Q1 and Q3, but because the last few months have been such a rollercoaster for $TSLA and it probably makes more sense to do them after the full year numbers anyways, I decided to do this one a little bit earlier. In the future I'll just be doing them after H1 and H2.

-----------------

**Looking back**

Since my first projections started with 2022, this is the first time we can compare my projections to Tesla's actual results. As such, I figured it'd be interesting to assess how far off my projections were.

Combining the bear and bull cases for 2022 of each post into a table together with the actuals:

**Sales**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|1,400,000|1,400,000|1,350,000|
|**Bull**|1,700,000|1,900,000|1,500,000|

Actuals: **1,313,851**

In terms of unit sales, my projections were definitely too optimistic. Tesla ended up slightly underperforming my bear cases, although a caveat here is that Tesla had 60K cars in transit at the end of 2022 and missed out on ~75K units due to COVID shutdowns in China. Without these one-time occurrences, they would've ended the year on ~1,450,000 units above my bear cases but still significantly below my bull cases.

That said, accounting for force majeure is supposed to be part of the bear case, so I need to be more conservative here in the future.

**ASP**

For ASPs, I projected $50,000, $55,000 and $54,000 respectively. Actuals came in at **$54,385**, so I was pretty much spot-on.

**Revenue**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|$70B|$77B|$73|
|**Bull**|$85B|$105B|$81B|

Actuals: **$71B**

Because unit sales fell short, but ASPs were correct, revenue also fell slightly short. That said, it wasn't off by a lot.

**Operating Margin**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|14%|19%|17%|
|**Bull**|14%|22%|19%|

Actuals: **17%**

Here I underestimated Tesla's margins a bit in Part 1, but overestimated them after the huge beat in Q1 2022. Ultimately it was pretty close to the averages over time.

**Net Income**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|$9.8B|$14.6B|$12.4B|
|**Bull**|$11.9B|$22.1B|$15.4B|

Actuals: **$12.6B**

Finally the Net Income. Here I made a bit of a mistake. Because I did not expect Tesla to make (much) profits from their non-automotive businesses, I only looked at automotive revenues and applied the Operating Margin to that number; however, throughout 2022 both Tesla's Energy and Services divisions became profitable, so the actual numbers from automotive would be slightly lower. Either way, I believe the difference is small enough that we can ignore it for now, and my projections were pretty accurate.

**Conclusion**

Tesla had a very difficult year in 2022 with factory shutdowns in China, high commodity prices and a looming recession. As such, I would've expected them to be close to my bear case, which is exactly what happened. Although I overestimated unit sales and became a bit too optimistic after the massive Q1 beat, all the other numbers were fairly accurate.

Regardless, I will try to be slightly more conservative with my bear case numbers in the future to leave a larger margin for error, as you could argue that 2022 could've been even worse for Tesla under certain circumstances.

------------

**The Future**

Looking at the future, although it is still difficult to predict without knowing the plans that Tesla is expected to reveal at the investor day in March, I will include 2025 in my projections.

**Sales**

To increase my margin of safety, I have reduced the 2023 bear case numbers significantly. When annualized, Tesla is currently producing roughly 650K cars from Fremont, 1M from Shanghai, and 250K from Berlin and from Texas. So even without further scaling from Berlin and Texas, which are both expected to double in production throughout the year, Tesla would do 2.15M cars this year.

That said, in an absolute worst case, I would see Fremont being shut down for retooling, Shanghai suffering from further COVID shutdowns and Berlin and Texas encountering severe issues with the ramp-up. In this extremely unlikely scenario, I could see them producing 400K, 800K, 250K and 250K units respectively, for a total of 1.7M units.

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,700,000|2,400,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,400,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,800,000|

**ASP**

Tesla dropped prices significantly in Q1. As such, I expect them to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. After 2023 I find them difficult to predict, so I will stick with $51K (essentially offsetting inflation).

**Revenue**

Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$87B|$122B|
|**2024**|$122B|$173B|
|**2025**|$153B|$245B|

Additionally, I expect the following revenue from non-automotive divisions:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$16B|$24B|
|**2024**|$22B|$40B|
|**2025**|$30B|$60B|

**Operating Margin**

Despite the price cuts, I expect IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, continuing manufacturing innovations, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas) and higher margins from Semis, Cybertrucks and Energy to largely offset the hit on margins (16% in Q4 and 16.8% in FY 2022).

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|14%|19%|
|**2024**|15%|22%|
|**2025**|16%|25%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|$14.4B|$28.8B|
|**2024**|$21.6B|$47.9B|
|**2025**|$29.3B|$76.3B|

**P/E**

Dividing the current $600B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|42|21|
|**2024**|28|13|
|**2025**|20|8|

**PEG**

This would translate into the following PEG ratings:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|2.80|0.16|
|**2024**|0.56|0.20|
|**2025**|0.56|0.14|

------------------------------

**The conclusion**

No matter which metric you look at, it's clear that at $108 Tesla was heavily oversold. At its current price, there is an argument to be made that Tesla is fairly valued or even slightly overvalued if you look max 1 year out, in the bear case scenario. This would require Tesla to miss their self-proclaimed sandbagged guidance and for margins to come down for the full year.

If you're willing to look out more than 1 year, or you believe the bull case (or something in between my bear and bull case, which is my personal expectation) to be right, Tesla is still clearly undervalued. It would need to grow between 79% and 1,300% through Q1 2026 to revert to the average PEG rating for high growth large caps."

Hi all

I'm not here to shit on anything. But I use to trade options on MPW. There were a few things that were yellow flags for me. Yellow flags meaning they might be issues or could indicate issues but alone are not enough to disqualify MPW for me.

1. High premium usually indicates high risk. REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia.
2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons. The biggest concern is fundamentals of the company. Another is a possible dividend cut.
3. MPW recently wrote down a pretty substantial amount of money from one of their tenants going into bankruptcy. This was given in their last earnings report/call. This would explain the drop in share price in the last couple weeks.

Then I came across some things online. The info to me turns those yellow flags into big red flags. So I just wanted to share this and get feedback. Links below.

But, I would like to get more attention with this post on stocks that are trying to transform to a new business model or due a turnaround. A few ideas I'm aware of:

&#x200B;

* **Warner Bros Discovery**: Invest in WBD if you believe that they will successfully transition from a legacy TV to a streaming TV player and they'll realize all of the revenue & cost synergies of combining Warner Bros & Discovery together

&#x200B;

* **any auto manufacturer not named Tesla**: Tesla has a 10 year headstart on electric vehicles so find a company that you believe can spend their capex efficiently & effectively on CapEx technology and then can harvest those prior CapEx investments someday to be a profitable EV player. Ford, General Motores, and there are a couple more.

&#x200B;

* **Netflix**: Invest in Netflix if you believe their transition from subscription video on demand to a hybrid option that includes cheaper advertising video on demand will help them lose fewer subscribers and continue growing revenue

&#x200B;

* **Meta**: Invest in Meta if you think their metaverse bet will work out

&#x200B;

* **Peloton**: Invest in Peloton if you think a new CEO and the restructuring moves will work out for a stock that has struggled ever since the economy reopened

&#x200B;

* **Intel** Invest in Intel if you believe they'll address their technological debt with their chips & can benefit from geopolitical outcomes on foundry competitors

&#x200B;

*Disclosure: I don't own any of these stocks and not interested in purchasing any of them at the moment except Warner Bros Discovery*"

> S&P 500 futures were lower as a spike in oil prices added another threat to an economy already struggling from Federal Reserve rate hikes and recent turmoil in the banking sector.
*****
> Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as second-quarter trading began.
*****
> Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 134 points, or 0.4%. Chevron is set to give the index a boost as it gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on the spike in oil prices.
*****
> The output cut from OPEC+, which is slashing 1.16 million barrels per day, sent oil prices soaring. West Texas Intermediate crude was 6.6% higher, while international benchmark Brent crude climbed 6%.
*****
> Traders are shedding optimism from recent market strength with the prospect of higher oil prices adding to fears of higher inflation and a looming recession.
*****
> The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE), which tracks the S&P 500 energy sector, also popped more than 3% in the premarket. Marathon Oil and Halliburton were the fund’s best performers, rising more than 6% each.
*****
> All three major averages were positive in the first quarter, despite turmoil in the banking sector highlighted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. The Nasdaq Composite led the way in the quarter with a gain of 16.8% while the S&P 500 rose 7% in the first three months of the year for its second-straight positive quarter. The Dow industrials lagged but still managed to grind out an advance of 0.4%.
*****
> “For now at least, tech is seen as a safe haven of all things, immune to the news in banking. The S&P 500, in turn, seems held together by its own heavy weighting in tech, names like Microsoft, Apple and the like,” Wellington Shields technical analyst Frank Gretz said in a note to clients.

> The first week of the new quarter is a shortened one for Wall Street, as trading will be closed for Good Friday. However, there will be several key pieces of economic data for investors, including job openings data on Tuesday, ADP private payrolls report on Wednesday and the closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.

# [Stock futures rise after Nasdaq’s third straight winning day](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Wednesday as Wall Street looked to build on what has been a positive start to 2023 so far.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 94 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.3%.
*****
> The moves come after the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01% on Tuesday to clinch its first three-day winning streak since November. The S&P 500 and Dow rose 0.70% and 0.56%, respectively, and all three averages are positive for the young year.
*****
> 2023 has brought a relief rally so far for more risky areas of the market, such as tech, but many investors are still cautious ahead of earnings season and further expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
> “I think it is going to be a challenge to try to time when the Fed will ultimately start to cut rates,” said Matthew Palazzolo, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There is some evidence that when rates start to decline from the Federal Reserve, better markets are ahead. But whether that ends up being in 2024 or late 2023, at least at this point in time, sitting the middle of January, it’s just too difficult a situation.”
*****
> Wednesday features a light schedule for economic data, but investors will be gearing up for a key inflation report on Thursday and major bank earnings on Friday.

*****
> Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
> Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
> The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
> The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

180,Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,24,znww2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znww2s/reflections_of_poor_decisions_in_2022/,44,1671247290.0,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback."

I'm not asking about companies like Amazon, Nvidia, or Tesla, whose success would have been quite difficult to predict at the time.

“I really don’t have more to say on that piece, as well — on the (sic) Elon Musk and what he’s choosing to do and not to do.  I’m not going to say more from here.”

So apparently the speculation that a nation security review would halt the Twitter buy is over. Thoughts?

183,Tesla Vs Competition,21,13a66ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13a66ka/tesla_vs_competition/,77,1683416583.0,"First of all, I understand I may be beating a dead horse here, so I apologize. I also know Tesla is a highly polarizing stock to discuss. I have made money and lost money on Tesla in the past and I am currently trying to be as non-bias as possible and want to ensure I am understanding correctly.

As everyone knows, Tesla is priced at a dramatically higher price than it's competitors, with many saying it is all due to hype (which very well could be possible). From my understanding, although Tesla is involved in solar to some capacity, around 90+% of Tesla revenue comes from vehicle sales (I believe the number is 93% vehicle sales). 

I do understand that Tesla was essentially ""the first"" big name in electric vehicles, giving them a first mover advantage. Anecdotally, I see an insane number of them on the road compared to any other EV. However, most auto makers are moving into the EV space. Based on online reviews I have read, other automakers vehicles are more reliable and better in a lot of areas comparatively to Tesla. 

Additionally, I have heard of Tesla having long standing quality control issues. To my knowledge, the model 3 is the most affordable electric EV with the technology currently available, but even that has some issues, such as ""full self driving"" not really being full self driving and most competitors having similar systems that can do most of what the FSD can do.

I do find Tesla as a whole very fascinating (if anything, as a case study of how quick a company can grow and to the level it has). In a way, I really want Tesla to win and be this awesome, futuristic if you will, vehicle unlike anything we have seen. I was a Tesla bull for a long time, but recently have been thinking deeper into this and now trying be as unbiased as possible. I have learned more about competitors and pushes further doubts into my mind. I have heard really terrific things about the Mach E Mustang for example, with it beating Tesla in several categories, just as one example here.

With that said, what is the unbiased bull and bear case for Tesla? What is a genuine reason it can be priced so much higher than it's competitors outside of hype, or is it just that, hype? Is the first mover advantage just being displayed to an insane level and it will surely not last?  I'm extremely curious as to everyone's opinions and what you have to say! Thank you in advance."

Hello everyone, with almost every company falling off a cliff after earnings, I’m concerned that Tesla might be the next one. I’m thinking about selling an insignificant amount of shares and buy puts to hedge. 

Here are some of my concerns:

They miss due to delivery miss and this lower guidance… since the markets have been spooked due to the amount of exports and the China recession perhaps this could be priced in but there’s no way of knowing. 

They beat and announce a share buy back and they maintain their guidance… however if it’s very good and the stock rises, i feet that the big man will use it as an opportunity to offload shares for his Twitter acquisition :/ huge overhang. 

Perhaps they beat on every aspect and we get a rally in the stock for whatever reason. But this given the conditions is unlikely. 

I’m thinking about buying puts expiring on that Friday… 

What does everyone think and please share your play. Remember this is not financial advice. I’m just a dude on the internet sharing and looking for others perspectives."

I sold a small amount of Tesla, Coinbase, and NVDA awhile back and then bought some Puts on them (made a little but nothing compared to what was lost over the past year from the stocks going down). I assumed I could just use the losses to help on my taxes to offset other gains, but then it hit me that maybe an option contract is considered the same as owning stock in the eyes of the IRS and that would invalidate my losses (it is and it isn't at the same time from what I understand being only a contract that controls stock and not the stock itself).

So... did I screw myself? Rookie mistake?"

# [Stock futures rise as investors assess risk of an economic downturn](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures moved slightly higher Thursday after the S&P 500 declined for a fifth consecutive day and Wall Street evaluated the likelihood of a recession ahead.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 100 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
> Exxon rose 1% as the oil giant it lifted its buybacks, while Chevron gained on a higher capital spending budget. Tesla slumped amid reports of shortened shifts at its Shanghai factory.
*****
> “U.S. equity futures are trying to stabilize, and Treasuries are witnessing tiny profit taking, but the mood is still gloomy,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge in a note to clients Thursday. “The problem for domestic stocks is the absence of catalysts – two inflation figures come Fri (PPI and Michigan expectations), but the real fireworks arrive next week.”
*****
> Investors’ attention has shifted toward next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to issue a 50 basis point interest rate hike. It’s a smaller increase than the prior four rate hikes, but may do little to alleviate concerns over whether the Fed can avoid a recession next year in its attempt to squash surging prices. November’s consumer price index, due Tuesday, should also provide more clarity on the direction of inflation.
*****
> In the near term, Wall Street awaits the latest data on weekly jobless claims before the bell on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating claims to come in at 230,000, up slightly from the prior week’s total of 225,000.
*****
> Traders expect most recent earnings results from Lululemon Athletica, DocuSign, Broadcom and Costco after the bell Thursday.
*****
> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 declined 0.19% in its fifth straight losing session. The Dow was virtually flat, adding just 1.58 points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.51%.

I come to you for an opinion on what I should do with some money I was able to roll over into my Roth. The fiscal conservative in me wants to buy a fund or go with VOO or something, but the risk taker in me wants to take advantage of some of these dips. I am looking into TSLA or AAPLin particular, assuming there will be a recovery in the next few years. Ideally I would like to buy something that is dipping now, ride it up and then swap it for something more conservative once the market adjusts. That being said, I’d also love to win the lottery, so no need to state the obvious or grill me on my naivety. I obviously don’t want my money to just sit there until we “bottom out” and would like to take my chances at making a greater return than I would in funds. For what it’s worth I do believe both Tesla and Apple are strong companies that will be key players in the next decades. I will also not be able to touch this money for another 28 years so there’s time to play. Thanks in advance for any advice or help!"
192,The one question I do have about Cathie’s trades…,20,13eois3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13eois3/the_one_question_i_do_have_about_cathies_trades/,37,1683814200.0,"Cathie Wood gets a lot of criticism, some of it justified. (I wouldn’t want to hear my fund manager say they are guided by a religious deity, either.) That said, she has had plenty of victories, and she seems to have an explanation for her various investment decisions.

I’m not trying to start another Wood trash-fest, but I have noticed something a bit interesting: Some of Ark’s big moves seem to be delayed to an odd extent, and sometimes almost seem like reactions to changes in the stock price.

Perfect example is Palantir: It’s been mainstream knowledge for a while that they are trying to innovate in the area of AI, machine learning, and big data analytics.

And Cathie was well aware of them — [her fund sold](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ark-invest-sells-palantir-shares-for-123-million-buys-tesla-2022-2) after a disappointing earnings report last year.

Today I see the headline: “Cathie Wood Makes Whopping $43M Palantir Buy After Stock's Massive Surge.” Why would it take so long to do so? It seems like she and her team would be keeping a close eye on the company, and would have pulled the trigger immediately in response to their projection of profitability for the foreseeable future.

(It’s also worth asking: Considering that Ark’s strategy is based on investing in companies that will innovate over the long-term, why wouldn’t she be buying and holding?)"

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to build on Monday’s rally, regional banks jump: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders tried to add to a rally from the previous session that was sparked by hope that the banking turmoil would be contained.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 382 points, or 1.2%. S&P 500 futures also climbed 0.9%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%.
*****
> Regional banks surged in early trading, led by First Republic. The beaten-down bank jumped 21.9%, a day after losing 47%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3%. Regionals got a boost after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday morning that the government is ready to provide further guarantees of deposits if the banking crisis worsens.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a strong rally, with the Dow surging more than 380 points Monday, while the S&P 500 gained 0.9%. The action came a day after a forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which was engineered by the Swiss government. Investors also welcomed news that JPMorgan Chase could be advising embattled First Republic Bank on strategic alternatives.
*****
> “Bank selling appears exhausted and it would take the emergence of fresh deposit problems at a new name to bring out incremental supply, although there’s very little interest to step in and buy the group, especially the regionals,” Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note.
*****
> Investors now expect a slower pace of tightening from the Federal Reserve in light of the banking crisis. Traders now are pricing in a 83% chance of a quarter-point rate hike when the Fed wraps its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The probability of a pause is at 16.6%.
*****
> “Risks of contagion are rising and could push the Fed to pause the current rate hiking cycle, although this is not our base case,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “The Fed will likely signal they are near the end of their rate hiking campaign as recession risks increase and inflation pressures decrease.”

196,Clock ticking for Elon Musk to buy Twitter — has until until 5 pm ET on Fri Oct 28 to agree to a new deal or the case will resume in Nov,14,yd4rbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yd4rbx/clock_ticking_for_elon_musk_to_buy_twitter_has/,19,1666704263.0,"* **Elon Musk has until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to close his deal with Twitter or a trial date will be set.**
* **Experts say the deal is expected to close. If not, Musk could face an uphill battle in court.**
* **If Musk becomes Twitter's new owner, Twitter will undergo a chapter of major change and likely layoffs.**
* **Musk will have to pay $32 billion to close the deal (excluding loans) - likely to sell anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock to help finance the deal**

The billionaire has only four days to close his deal with Twitter or face a trial — **which experts say he is** **likely to lose.**

Earlier this month, the Delaware judge overseeing the court case gave the two parties **until 5 p.m. ET on** **Friday,** **October 28** **to agree to a new deal or the case will resume in a five-day trial in November.**

Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick is unlikely to offer an extension and would favor a quick start for the trial if Musk misses the deadline, University of Michigan business law professor Erik Gordon told Insider.

Ann Lipton, a business law professor at Tulane University Law School, told Insider that, **""unless there's truly some new, intervening event that was entirely out of Musk's control that derails the deal, he'll probably have exhausted the court's supply of goodwill.""**

Anat Alon-Beck, assistant professor of law at Case Western Reserve University, said Musk would likely end up buying the company even if he can't complete the acquisition ahead of the deadline — **after paying** **millions more in legal fees.**

**But, experts say Musk is likely to reach a deal before the deadline expires on Friday.**

Things would get worse for Musk if he heads to court

If the two parties don't reach an agreement before Friday, they could technically continue to negotiate even as litigation resumes and a trial date is scheduled.

But a continued court battle is unlikely to do Musk any favors.

**""He knows that he has no way out of it and would like to avoid public humiliation,""** Alon-Beck told Insider.

**If the trial were to proceed, Musk would face a** **lengthy deposition** **and could see even more of his** **private texts** **released to the public**, Gerard Filitti, senior counsel at The Lawfare Project, an international non-profit legal think tank and litigation fund based in New York City, [previously told Insider.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loser-in-twitter-takeover-lawyers-win-2022-10)

**Last week,** **Bloomberg reported** **that Twitter and Musk are drawing up paperwork to close the deal ahead of the Friday deadline, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.** When Musk initially filed to end the court case and buy the company at the original price, Twitter appeared wary of the billionaire's intentions. The company has said it will not close the deal until Musk can prove he has funding in place.

Musk's original financing package for Twitter included **$21 billion in cash and $12.5 billion of margin loans secured against his 16% stake in Tesla, as well as $13 billion in loans from several banks**. But, Insider's Kali Hay reported that at least one investor was looking to pull out of the deal.

The banks, including Morgan Stanley, are finalizing funding, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. **The billionaire is still on the hook for another $32 billion, but is likely to sell anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock to help finance the deal**, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a note on Friday.

If Musk goes through with the deal this week, it's still possible the saga could continue even after an agreement is reached.

#[Stock futures edge lower as Wall Street awaits final trading day of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures edged lower in premarket trading Friday as investors braced for the final trading day of the worst year for stocks since 2008.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 130 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.6% and nearly 0.9%, respectively.
*****
> The overnight moves followed a rally Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 climbing about 2.6% and roughly 1.8%, respectively. The Dow jumped 345 points, or 1.05%.
*****
> For the week, the Dow and S&P are slightly higher, with the Nasdaq on track for a modest loss. All major averages are lower for December and are poised to snap a two-month win streak.
*****
> Friday marks the final day of trading of what’s been a painful year for stocks. A volatile bear market, sticky inflation, and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks. These factors also weighed on investor sentiment.
*****
> All three of the major averages are marching toward their worst year since 2008, slated to snap a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down 8.58%, while the S&P and tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 19.24% and 33.03%, respectively.
*****
> As the calendar year turns the corner, some investors think the pain is far from over, and expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows.
*****
> “We’re sort of stuck in neutral right now, because there are more unanswered questions than there are known entities. ... We’ve got a lot riding on this coming earnings season, when we think about the pressures that are going to exist on margins,” Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at Riverfront Investment Group, said on “Squawk Box.”
*****
> “There are a lot of questions as we head into the new year, but we certainly will be happy to see 2022 go over,” Felton added.
*****
> Despite the yearly losses, the Dow is on pace for a 15.65% quarterly gain and is primed to snap a three-quarter losing streak. It’s also headed for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. The S&P is up 7.35% and slated to break three consecutive quarterly losses. The Nasdaq’s slipped 0.92%, for its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001.
*****
> All major S&P sectors finished Thursday with gains, led to the upside by communication services. For the quarter, consumer discretionary and communication services are the only sectors headed for losses. Energy is the only sector on pace for yearly gains after surging nearly 58%.
*****
> Communication services stocks in the S&P 500 are down more than 40% on the year and consumer discretionary has fallen 37.4%, while energy, the large-cap index’s only positive sector, has soared nearly 58%.
*****
> On the economic front, Chicago PMI data for December is due out Friday. Next week will see a slightly more active slate for economic data, highlighted by the nonfarm payrolls report set for Jan. 6. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of the New Year’s Day holiday.

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Tuesday as the market remained resilient even after a spike in oil prices.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 48 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 are coming off their fourth straight day of gains, rising nearly 1% and 0.4% on Monday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, slipped 0.3%.
*****
> Markets have been resilient of late, with the major averages rising even when faced by persistent inflation, a banking crisis and higher rates.
*****
> This week, the energy market became another potential source of uncertainty, after OPEC+ announced it was slashing output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. West Texas Intermediate futures had their biggest daily gain in nearly a year on the news. On Tuesday, crude rose another 1%.
*****
> “Given the transition the world is undergoing as it embraces ‘clean and green energy,’ OPEC+ understands all too well that its still highly valued ‘liquid gold’ will at some point begin to lose its shine,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
> “Until then, as the countries dominating OPEC+ prepare for the future by spending trillions of dollars rebuilding infrastructure and refocusing away from crude oil as their primary source of income, managing the price of crude will be used more directly and aggressively than was anticipated,” she added.
*****
> Analysts say the prospect of higher oil prices could stoke inflation and recession fears, but Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said she doesn’t expect markets to price in a recession a second time after the “pretty severe” bear market in 2022. If there is some volatility, it’s more likely to be a “normal” correction of between 5% and 15% that sets the market up for a better second half, she said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “We do think we’re headed toward a period of consolidation, maybe some volatility,” she said, highlighting earnings, market expectations of Fed policy and a slowdown in lending amid the banking crises as three incremental headwinds.
*****
> On Tuesday investors will get the latest number from the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, at 10 a.m. ET.

# [Dow futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from tough September](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher Monday as Wall Street tried to start the new month, and quarter, on a solid note.
*****
> Dow futures traded 164 points higher, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.
*****
> Those moves came as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell further, after finishing the previous week 18 basis points down from its mid-week high.
*****
> “It’s pretty simple at this point, 10-year Treasury yield goes up, and equities likely remain under pressure,” Raymond James’ Tavis McCourt said. “It comes down, and equities rally.”
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a tough month, with the Dow and S&P 500 notching their biggest monthly losses since March 2020. The Dow on Friday also closed below below 29,000 for the first time since November 2020.
*****
> The Dow shed 8.8% in September, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively.
*****
> For the quarter, the Dow fell 6.66% to notch a three-quarter losing streak for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. Both the S&P and Nasdaq Composite fell 5.28% and 4.11%, respectively, to finish their third consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2009.
*****
> As the new quarter kicks off, all S&P 500 sectors sit at least 10% off their 52-week highs. Nine sectors finished the quarter in negative territory.
*****
> In the fourth quarter, elevated inflation and a Federal Reserve intent on bringing surging prices to a halt regardless of what it means for the economy will likely continue to weigh on markets, said Truist’s Keith Lerner. Oversold conditions, however, also make the market vulnerable to a sharp short-term bounce on good news, he added.
*****
> “I think we could be set up for some type of reprieve but the underlying trend at this point is still a downward trend and choppy waters to continue,” Lerner said.
*****
> On the economic front, Markit PMI and ISM manufacturing data are slated for release on Monday along with construction spending.

# [S&P 500 futures slip after index hits 6-week high, Tesla shares to boost Nasdaq](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/20/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures dipped Thursday after a batch of mixed corporate earnings from companies. Tesla shares boosted Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 117 points, or 0.37%. S&P 500 futures ticked down 0.23%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.01%.
*****
> The moves come as Wall Street is enjoying a July rebound. All three major averages hit their highest levels in more than a month during Wednesday’s session, with the S&P 500 reaching its best closing level since June 9.
*****
> Tesla shares were choppy after the automaker reported stronger-than-expected earnings but shrinking automotive gross margins. As of 7:54 a.m. ET, the stock was up 2.6%.
*****
> American Airlines beat revenue expectations in the second quarter, and forecasted a profit in the third quarter, as consumers continue to travel even with higher prices. Shares fell more than 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> United Airlines reported that it returned to profitability during the second quarter, but results came in below expectations. The stock fell more than 6% in premarket trading.
*****
> Meanwhile, shares of Alcoa and CSX jumped in the premarket after the companies beat expectations.
*****
> Roughly 13% of S&P 500 have reported earnings for the second quarter. Of those companies, about two-thirds have beaten expectations, according to FactSet.

> The Nasdaq Composite jumped nearly 1.6% on Wednesday, its fourth positive session in five. The tech-heavy index is up about 3.9% for the week.
*****
> Meanwhile, the Dow and S&P 500 each rose for the third day in four. The blue-chip index is up nearly 1.9% for the week, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.5% thus far.
*****
> “The bulls seem to be coming back into the market now. We’ve seen pretty sharp rallies in tech, c/rypto and other risk assets over the past few days,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Which is notable to us, because in an economy with some pretty notable weakness in it, you’d expect to be seeing other parts of the market performing well. But the animal spirits are back, at least for now.”
*****
> In other corporate news, shares of Carnival dropped more than 10% after the cruise company announced that it was selling an additional $1 billion of stock.
*****
> On the data front, investors will also be watching initial jobless claims data, which has been trending upward in recent weeks.

*****
> U.S. stock futures fell Monday as investors awaited more economic data ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting later this month.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 150 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off its second positive week in a row, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advancing 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The Dow advanced 0.2% last week.
*****
> In other news, Tesla shares slumped more than 4% on reports of an output cut at its Shanghai factory.
*****
> Those moves came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that smaller interest rate hikes could start in December. The Fed is slated to meet Dec. 13-14 and is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points. On Friday, stronger-than-expected jobs report initially rattled markets, but traders later shook it off.
*****
> Despite the recent rally, Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said the risk-reward for equities has likely reached its cap as it nears the bank’s original tactical target range of 4,000 to 4,150.
*****
> “As suggested two weeks ago, for this tactical rally to go higher, back end rates would need to fall,” he said in a note to clients Monday. “Fast forward to today and that’s what has happened. However, we are now right into our original upside targets and we recommend taking profits before the Bear returns in earnest.”
*****
> On the economic front, investors are expecting the November ISM services data at 10 a.m. ET on Monday. Economists polled by the Dow Jones expected a reading of 53.7.

# **Dow closes 400 points lower to end a wild week of trading - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> Stocks slumped Friday, capping off a volatile week of trading, a day after posting a historic turnaround rally as investors digested inflation expectations.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 403.89 points, or 1.34%, to end the day at 29,634.83. Still, the index was up 1.15% on the week. The S&P 500 shed 2.37% to 3,583.07 and notched its seventh negative close in eight days. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.08%, ending the day at 10,321.39, weighed down by losses in Tesla and Lucid Motors, which declined 7.55% and 8.61%, respectively.
*****
> Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week lower, falling 1.55% and 3.11%, respectively.
*****
> Stocks fell to session lows after a consumer survey from the University of Michigan showed inflation expectations were increasing, a sentiment that the Federal Reserve is likely watching closely. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led declines as growth companies are most sensitive to interest rate hikes.
*****
> At the same time, bond yields spiked, with the rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury topping 4% for the second time in two days as investors react to higher inflation expectations.
*****
> Markets whipsawed throughout the week as investors weighed new inflation data that will inform the Fed as it continues to hike interest rates to cool off price increases. On Thursday, stocks staged a major turnaround. The Dow ended Thursday’s session up 827 points after being down more than 500 points at the intraday low. The S&P 500 rose 2.6% to break a six-day losing streak, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.
*****
> Thursday marked the fifth largest intraday reversal from a low in the history of the S&P 500, and it was the fourth largest for the Nasdaq, according to SentimenTrader.
*****
> The moves followed the release of the consumer price index, a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected for the month of September. Initially, this weighed on markets as investors braced themselves for the Federal Reserve to continue with its aggressive rate-hiking plan. Later, however, they shrugged off those worries.
*****
> Still, persistent inflation remains a problem for the Fed and for investors’ worries around the central bank’s policy tightening.
*****
> “With core CPI still moving in the wrong direction and the labor market strong, the conditions are not in place for a Fed policy pivot, which would be one of the conditions for a sustained rally in the equity market,” wrote UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a Friday note.
*****
> “Moreover, as inflation remains elevated for longer and the Fed hikes further, the risk increases that the cumulative effect of policy tightening pushes the US economy into recession, undermining the outlook for corporate earnings,” he added.

> # 7 Remembering The 1987 Crash

> October is known for many things, with incredible market crashes likely being at the top of the list. The Crashes of 1929 and 1987 stand out for many investors and who could forget the selling and volatility of October 2008?

> In honor of the greatest drop in stock market history, we’ll take a closer look at the crash of 1987. On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow fell 22.6% for the largest one-day drop in the more than 126-year history of the Dow. To this day it is still the largest percentage drop ever, but it now ranks as the 97th largest point decline.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1987crash-chart-800x395.png))**

> What caused it? The funny thing is that 35 years later I’m not sure everyone can officially agree. Here are some things to know about the Crash of 1987:

> * For starters, stocks were in the midst of a huge run off the August 1982 lows, with the Dow up more than 40% for the year in early August 1987, amounting to one stretched rubber band.
> * Then consider Alan Greenspan took over the Federal Reserve Bank in August and to cool things off, was hiking rates. Talk about a bad time to start a new job.
> * Program trading was blamed as well, with Louis Rukeyser the Friday night before the crash pointing out issues with program trading. (Simply put, program trading meant stocks were liquidated as certain levels were hit. It worked fine until stocks began to fall more than ever expected, leading to more selling as prices dropped.)
> * Currency markets were on edge as well, as the U.S. wanted Germany to weaken their currency due to the latest trade deficit numbers. The back and forth was all over the media, as recently as the Sunday before the crash.
> * The selling started earlier actually, as the three days before the crash the Dow was down 3.8%, 2.4%, and 4.6%, making it safe to say investors were on edge all weekend for how things might open on Monday morning.
In the end, the Dow fell a then record 508 points for a 22.6% one-day decline, topping the previous largest one-day decline of 20.5% in December 1914, when the Dow began trading after being halted for nearly five months due to World War I.

> Something most investors might not know is that stocks still finished the year in the green in 1987. Sure, they were well off their highs and the huge volatility was too much for many investors to handle, but if all you saw was the yearly gain of 2% in 1987, you’d think it was a boring year!

> We might not know what caused the Crash of 1987, but we also still don’t know what caused the Flash Crash either. The Flash Crash occurred in May 2010 (when many stocks and ETFs lost huge values, only to regain the losses by the close for one wild few minutes of trading). The truth is with more and more computers involved, we are due to get big swings periodically. March 2020 saw some of the largest swings of all time (seven of the 10 largest point declines ever took place during this year), putting major stress on the system.

> Today we do have circuit breakers in place to help calm nerves should we see another major decline in prices, but it’ll take a huge drop for those to kick in.

> In the end, volatility is the price of admission and although we think we are much closer to a major low in stocks currently, should we all have the privilege to invest long enough, there will likely be another day stocks fall significantly. And when they do, just remember that the Dow started trading on May 24, 1896, and it has seen wars, famines, pandemics, inflation, deflation, booms and busts, and more. Yet, it has always eventually come back to new highs and we don’t think this time will be any different.

> # More Bears End in October Than Any Other Month

> Not all indices have bottomed on the same day for all bear markets, but the lion’s share, or bear’s share I should say, bottomed in October.

> Of the 23 bear markets since WWII 8 have bottomed in October for DJIA and 7 for S&P 500, 6 for NASDAQ, significantly more than any other month. Over all three indices, 7 were in midterm October: 1946, 1960, 1966, 1974, 1990, 1998 & 2002.

> DJIA October bottoms: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1966, 1987, 1990, 2002 & 2011. S&P October bottoms: 1957, 1960, 1966, 1974, 1990, 2002 & 2011. NASDAQ October bottoms: 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2002 & 2011.

> The month with the next largest amount of bear market lows is March with 4 for S&P 500 – mostly recently in 2009 and 2020, previously in 1978 & 1980. So, odds are a bottom is near.

> # Inflation and Labor Still A Problem

> The NFIB released its latest small business survey this morning with data as of the month of September. As we discussed in today's Morning Lineup, the report showed sentiment rebounded in September although labor market indicators decelerated further. That was also reflected in the report's survey of what businesses consider to be their most important problem. While those reporting 'cost of labor' as the biggest problem went unchanged, the percentage of respondents reporting quality of labor as their biggest concern dropped four percentage points to 22%. While there was an even lower reading as recently as July, it was the biggest drop since last December, and the current level has fallen out of the top decile of historical readings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**

> While the lower reading in labor market-related problems seems to reaffirm the slowing employment situation, inflation concerns ramped up modestly in September. 30% of businesses (versus 29% in August) reported inflation as their biggest concern. Additionally, another inflation-adjacent reading also rose with 5% reporting the cost or availability of insurance to be their biggest problem.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

 > On a combined basis, government-related concerns saw a net lower reading last month as well. Concerns around requirements and red tape rose up to a 5% share of responses, but those gains were offset by a two percentage point drop in the share of respondents seeing taxes as their biggest issue. With inflation and labor concerns remaining front and center of small business problems, government-related concerns continue to be muted to a historic degree.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**

> While the bulk of responses view labor or inflation as their biggest issues—62% of combined responses report one of these to be their biggest problem—there was a considerable pickup in those choosing ""other"" as their response last month. That reading rose from 5% to 8% bringing it from a 14th percentile reading all the way up to the 65th percentile. That is now the highest reading since May when it came in at an elevated 11%. Unfortunately, the report does not provide further detail as to what those ""other"" concerns specifically are but geo-political issues are likely part of the mix.

> # Hurricane Claims Come In

> Last week's jobless claims number went unrevised whereas the latest week's data rose by 9K up to 228K. That brings the seasonally adjusted number back up to the highest level since the end of August and was the first back-to-back increase since the first week of August.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101322-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims remain a hair below 200K and in line with the readings from the comparable weeks of the year in the few years before the pandemic. We would also note that the increase in claims at this point of the year is very much a regular occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101322-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

> Turning to continuing claims, the latest print for data through the end of September saw a modest 3K increase to 1.368 million. That is only the highest level in three weeks as the indicator remains well below pre-pandemic levels, unlike initial claims.

> On a national level, claims are moving higher but it is perhaps too early to say we are in a new trend as opposed to things like seasonality and one-off events like the weather. While 80% of states and territories saw claims move higher this week, a large share of the national move was concentrated in the Southeast likely as a result of Hurricane Ian. In the table below, we show the state-level readings for initial and continuing claims (NSA). Roughly a third of the national move in claims was thanks to claims in Florida more than tripling week over week. Now, initial claims in that state are at the highest level since May of last year. That was matched with a significant pickup in continuing claims as well. Although they have a smaller impact on national claims, other hurricane-impacted areas like Puerto Rico also saw a significant uptick in initial claims.

> # So Much for the Positive Wealth Effect

> As the weakness in equities continues, we wanted to provide an update on where the major averages stand relative to their pre-COVID highs in February 2020. In the case of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, they're both still up, but the gains are quickly fading. It has now been just about two and a half years since the pre-COVID high for the S&P 500, and from that peak to this morning, the S&P 500 is up just 5.5% and the Nasdaq is up 5.6%. On an annualized basis, that works out to less than 2.5%. What's that phrase people kept saying about irrational moves in stock prices?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/101122-SP-Nasdaq.png))**

> As if equity market returns relative to the pre-COVID high weren't pedestrian enough, keep in mind that once you take the impact of inflation into account, investors are actually now solidly in the red. The charts below show the performance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on an inflation-adjusted basis by adjusting historical prices based on headline CPI. After adjustments, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both down 7.7% from their February 2020 highs. As bad as the investing backdrop has been for equities, long-term US Treasuries have fared much worse than that. On a nominal basis, long-term US Treasuries have declined 28%, and after adjusting for inflation, the declines have been well over 30%.

> # Best Six Months Up 18-0 Midterm Years

> Going back to 1950 the Best Six Months has is best performance from November of the Midterm year to April of the Pre-Election year, by a factor of three. And none of the other years of the 4-year cycle had zero losses.

> December and February have been the weak spots with January and April leading the charge. From the October close to the April close BSM beginning in Midterm years gains 15.2% on average, up 18 down 0.

> Post-Election BSM: Average 3.1%, 11-8. Pre-Election BSM 4.6, 13-5. Election BSM: 5.3%, 14-4.

> Adding in the MACD timing indicator only improves the results slightly. This is worth noting this year at MACD triggered early and the Fed, inflation, recession, oil, the midterm elections, and Ukraine have pushed stocks to dangerous technical support levels. Proceed with caution.

> # 3 Charts to Watch

> First, the S&P 500 gained 5.7% the first two days of October, for the best two-day start to any quarter since the second quarter of 1938. Be aware, the S&P 500 added more than 40% after that bounce into the end of the year back then. But what about other 5% gains that spanned two days? Simply put, they are rare but also have taken place near some major lows in recent memory. As the chart below shows, most recently we saw this rare show of strength in March/April 2020, December 2018, August 2015, August 2011, and March 2009. In other words, those weren’t the worst time to accumulate stocks, and this strength more often than not marked the end of weakness and stronger price action was up next.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spx-up-5-percent-in-two-days-800x383.png))**

> Second, the calendar could be a major tailwind for investors going forward. Looking at years that ended in “2” showed the S&P 500 bottomed on October 5 historically and opened the door to a big rally. Years like 1962, 1972, 1982, 2002, and 2012 all saw big year-end rallies and we wouldn’t bet against 2022 joining this list.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/years-that-end-in-2-800x317.png))**

> Third, midterm years historically bottom on September 30 before a strong end-of-year rally. Wouldn’t you know it, the S&P 500 bottomed on September 30 before the huge early October surge. Could history be repeating? Speaking of seasonality, be sure to read this blog on fourth-quarter seasonality.

# [Stock futures fall after another losing week on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were lower early on Tuesday morning after the major averages finished another losing week.
*****
> Stock futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 332 points, or about 1%. S&P 500 futures dipped 1.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures shed about 1.4%.
*****
> Concerns about economic growth are hanging over investors as the U.S. market looks to recover after a rough first half to the year. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and China’s Vice Premier Liu He held a virtual call on Monday stateside to discuss macroeconomic issues. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has declined in recent days even as the Federal Reserve has pledged to aggressively fight inflation.
*****
> “The US market is all about pricing in a slowdown, and pricing in the fact that the Fed is forced to hike rates into a slowdown,” Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian said on “Squawk Box.”
*****
> Markets finished one of the worst halves in decades on Thursday, and major averages posted their fourth week of losses in five despite modest gains during Friday’s trading session.
*****
> In this shortened holiday week, investors are looking ahead to the release of June jobs report data on Friday. According to Dow Jones estimates, job growth likely slowed in June with 250,000 nonfarm payrolls added, down from 390,000 in May. Economists surveyed expect the unemployment rate to hold at 3.6%.
*****
> This week’s economic calendar also includes Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. May factory orders are expected for Tuesday, with earnings from WD-40 and Levi Strauss scheduled for Friday.
*****
> The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday for the July 4 holiday, but trading in Europe was choppy ahead of the market open in New York. The Euro slid to a 20-year low against the dollar on Tuesday.
*****
> Last week, despite modest Friday gains, the Dow dipped 1.3%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.2%, and the Nasdaq fell 4.1%. During Friday’s trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 321.83 points, or 1.1%, to 31,097.26, the S&P 500 gained 1.1% to 3,825.33 and the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.9% higher to 11,127.85.

I feel like Tesla is royally screwed.  I feel like it has been wayyyyyyyy over-valued for years, but as Elon Musk shifts alienating his major customer base (i.e. ""woke,"" educated, liberals) into overdrive I don't see his conservative sycophants picking up the slack and going green to drive their hero's ugly, ""woke,"" ev's.  Not to mention the ever increasing competition in the market.  I think Tesla has no place to go but down.  Am I too small to get in on Tesla's and Elon's self destruction?

My stocks were down so much from my 2021 cost average that it was stomach churning. Now I know the true meaning of pain. It was the only way to capitalize in the short term. 

Now that my 30 day wash sale period is over, I have the option to buy back into the stocks I sold, or admit defeat and accept the loss. 

I’m curious if the bull thesis for some of these stocks are still intact and if it’s wise to buy at these prices?:

SOFI (seems like a genius move after the bank charter) 

Proterra (PTRA) (the tesla of electric buses and commercial vehicles?) 

Palantir (PLTR)( Peter Theil founded it) 

UiPath (PATH)( if my job gets automated, might as well profit from it) 

Sea Limited (SE) (Amazon of Southeast Asia? ) 

Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) (Genomics seems like a asymmetric risk) 

Match Group (MTCH) (Single people always want to hook up) 

Digital Ocean (DOCN) (Competition for AWS) 

Draftkings (DKNG) ( The NFL literally owns a day of the week) 

Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) (The sentiment against Cathy Wood is so bad right now I can’t even believe it. Nice contrarian play) 

Unity Software (U) (Metaverse? Gaming?) 

Redfin (RDFN) ( if this survives the recession it will probably be a multibagger from today’s prices) 

Docusign (DOCU) (Motley fool recommendation. Seems like it can be replicated by any large tech company though) 

Thanks for the opinions. I know that if I were smart that I would just throw my money in VOO and dividend stocks, but I’m a fan of tech stocks. Getting ready for the Fed pivot"

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
> The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
> Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
> One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

213,Inflation Reduction Act Guidance Released! Ouch for Ford. Model Y Does NOT Qualify?,11,zyfb6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zyfb6h/inflation_reduction_act_guidance_released_ouch/,23,1672345213.0,"[https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1179](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1179)

&#x200B;

Apprently the Mach E is not considered an SUV, since it's only subsidized at hte $55k mark (only 2 of their base models qualif).

Apparently the VW ID4 is only considered an SUV if it has AWD, not RWD?

Apparently Tesla Model Y is only considered an SUV if it has 7 seats? Calls on Tesla third row seats, government trying to pump up Tesla ASPs lol.

&#x200B;

 I bet someone ran the #s in teh government and said ""do you realize how much money the IRA bill is gonna cost us?"" And now they're trying to find ways to limit the # of cars that qualify. The IRA is going to be dead by 2027 at latest."
214,Stock market news live updates: Stocks plummet after midterms as Wall Street turns eyes toward inflation data,9,yr8q8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr8q8q/stock_market_news_live_updates_stocks_plummet/,16,1668066909.0,"Stocks plummeted Wednesday after three days of gains, as investors mulled over a mixed verdict from the midterm election results and highly anticipated inflation data looms on the docket.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 (\^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points.

&#x200B;

Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance.

&#x200B;

“Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note.

&#x200B;

The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.

&#x200B;

“We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.”

&#x200B;

To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core CPI remains far above the Fed’s comfort zone.

&#x200B;

“We are still far above that 2% target,” Rebecca Felton, RiverFront Investment Group senior market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. “So, we don't believe that the Fed is going to ease up at any point in the near term. And so rates will stay higher for longer and inflationary pressures clearly are likely to stay higher for longer, too.”

&#x200B;

In corporate news on Wednesday, Meta Platforms (META) said the social media giant would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or about 13% of staff, as the company restructures to cope with the slumping digital ad market. Disney (DIS) posted weaker-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Tuesday, with the streaming business resulting in wider losses that offset strong performance at the theme parks. Disney stock shed more than 13%.

&#x200B;

Elsewhere in markets, the largest U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc.'s (DHI) reported fourth-quarter earnings that showed buyers canceled nearly a third of deals, the latest red flag for the housing market. Tesla stock also fell Wednesday following a filing that showed CEO Elon Musk sold 19.5 million shares from Nov. 4-8. The sale came after he bought Twitter for $44 billion.

&#x200B;

On the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Bumble (BMBL) are among the companies set to report earnings Wednesday.

&#x200B;

Cryptocurrencies were under pressure as investors digested the news that crypto exchange Binance said it will walk away from an initial offer to acquire its competitor FTX after a review of the company's structure and books. Bitcoin dropped more than 10% to trade at its lowest level in two years."

Opinions on Siemens? I work on PLCs. Allen Bradley and ABB group seems to be what I’ve come across the most. Siemens is more developed in Europe from what I’ve heard. I don’t know too much about the different branches such as healthcare that Siemens is a part of. Strange that Rockwell’s all time price graph is much more exponential than Siemens. Kinda reminds me how the Chinese markets are always wild and don’t make any sense at all. I wonder if European stocks are alright or do not make any sense either."

Would this in anyway lead to a trade war with sanctions and such and affect Chinese stocks like BABA, Tencent etc.?

More importantly would it affect most other companies, especially Apple, Tesla, Starbucks etc. who are heavily invested in China? 

Just tryna see where this would go. The Russian invasion lead to extreme high gas prices as well as recession fears and high inflation."

Or do you only take the FCF number of the last quarter as denominator?

So free cash flow was **$3.3B** in Q3-2022, **$0.6B** in Q2-2022, **$2.2B** in Q1-2022 and **$2.8B** in Q4-2021, those 4 FCF numbers combined gives **$8.9B**.

**With current market cap of $649B, does that mean current P/FCF is** (649/8.9=) **73?** Or do you take only the FCF number of the last quarter which would give (649/3.3=) **197** which is even more extreme. Hope somebody can clarify with the above example. Thanks."

# [Stock futures fall a second day on fears the Fed will tip the economy into a recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
> Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
> Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
> Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
> Investors digested the Federal Reserve’s latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday’s half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
> “Overall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‘hard part’ of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,” Bank of America’s Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> “The Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,” Gapen added.
*****
> Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed’s fight against inflation.
*****
> Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

# [Stock futures are muted as investors await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That’s a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
> Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what’s coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell’s language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
> “While we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. “A slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.”
*****
> Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
> The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

224,Google post covid boom: is it actually cheap?,11,x7rfvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x7rfvb/google_post_covid_boom_is_it_actually_cheap/,27,1662512932.0,"Whenever people ask what stock should I buy, or what are people buying during this down turn Google (or Alphabet as their parent company is called now) is always near the top of the list. The main reason being it's a strong growth stock, nice brand name, strong buy backs, and it's trading very cheap.

&#x200B;

or is it?

&#x200B;

Sure people always bring up it's trading at 20 PE, which in comparison to other big tech with apple and microsoft trading at 25-26 PE and Amazon/Tesla trading at 100, comparatively it is less overvalued.

&#x200B;

One thing I don't see people mention often is that google benefited heavily during covid with all the stimulus being thrown out, so the consumer was flushed with cash and it lead to companies increasing their advertising budgets leading to a digital ad boom. However, that seems to be normalizing if not on the decline. Google's revenue growth itself went from high 50% yoy last year to about 10% yoy last quarter (although this is a bit skewed because of easy comps during covid adpocalypse, and now harder comps from the post covid ad boom).

&#x200B;

Their net income and EPS are also on their way down, after skyrocketing in 2021-2022

&#x200B;

If google's eps suffers a reversion to the mean from tighter ad budgets, tougher competition, increased costs from increasing their workforce the by like 40% since 2019 then their PE could easily jump from 20 to 30 to 40. 

The price in PE is just one component, people often forget the E part which is earnings and it's likely earnings revisions to the downside will come. I feel this is somewhat reflected in the stock price already with google being noticeably weaker than other big tech the past couple of months."

Regardless, are there enough momo traders left to send it soaring again? I doubt mutual fund managers are going to double down in this market, after being whacked nearly 50%,  with most being overexposed to begin with. 

The shares were insanely difficult to short (thanks TD), but with the advent of the single stock etf’s, that problem has been mitigated. 
I’ll give this firm credit, at least they are actively calling for shorting TSLA, noting chart deterioration, oddly, not bloated valuations and increasing competition.

The Nasdaq has given up its gains over the last 2 years. If TSLA does the same, that puts it around 150.

226,CATL’s new 620-mile range EV battery,9,vp1s2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vp1s2b/catls_new_620mile_range_ev_battery/,24,1656684693.0,"[full article](https://www.autonews.com/china/li-auto-hozon-sign-catls-new-620-mile-range-ev-battery)

 

Chinese **electric vehicle** startups Li Auto Inc. and Hozon New Energy Automobile Co. emerged as the first customers of a new long-range battery that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. unveiled Thursday and plans to start mass producing in 2023.

The “Qilin” battery has a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) on one charge, energy density of up to 255 watt-hour per kilogram, and is safer and more durable than existing cells, according to CATL, as the world’s biggest maker of EV batteries is known. It is also 13 percent more powerful than one planned by Tesla Inc., a major customer of **CATL**.

The battery -- named after a Chinese mythical creature -- has the longest range offered by any mainstream manufacturer yet. It comes as CATL faces greater pressure to innovate and maintain its dominance, with rivals at home and abroad -- from BYD Co. and China Aviation Lithium Battery Co. to LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Panasonic Holdings Corp. -- developing their own products.

Li Auto’s founder and chairman, Li Xiang, used China’s microblogging platform Weibo to draw attention to a potential battery supply deal, sharing details of CATL’s Qilin and commenting: “See you next year.”

CATL responded: “Qilin has Li Auto.”

Beijing-based Li Auto, which trades in New York and Hong Kong, is due to launch its first pure EV model in 2023, following two models that use gasoline to power electric motors, including its latest -- the L9 luxury SUV -- that was unveiled this week, with deliveries to start in August.

Hozon also used Weibo to publicly link itself to the new battery.

CATL will also supply batteries to South Korea’s **Kia** Corp., though the type of cell is unknown. A CATL spokesman confirmed all three supplier deals Friday, without providing details.

A Kia spokesman declined to comment on CATL, saying only that the company is cooperating with various suppliers to “diversify and stabilize battery supply.”"

228,Lithium stocks,8,135obxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/135obxv/lithium_stocks/,18,1683039900.0,"So I have gotten into lithium companies over the past few years.  I have captured gains a couple times but recently the lithium space has dropped about 20-25% - I have LAC, SQM and ALB.  I am curious about SGML but not invested.  I want to consolidate in to a single company.  So looking for thoughts!

ALB has been around a while and has other revenue sources. But produces many lithium product to serve a number of industries.  Also, as a company, it is the largest provider of Lithium for EV in the world!

SQM is a darling to many analysts and are currently producing lithium as well as other products.  It reins as the second largest provider of lithium in the world.  However, their mines are in Chile and there has been talk about nationalizing lithium which could hurt SQM.

Both SQM and ALB have significant revenues.

Alternatively there is LAC with a mining operation in Argentina and the Nevada Project (Thacker Pass) which is in development and should start producing in early 2024.  Tesla and GM have invested significantly in LAC.  LAC still has a negative earnings per share but improving dramatically.  All reports seem to indicate a buyout candidate with in the next year.

Lastly SGML, which touts green lithium which means it is sustainably mines and mined with low carbon emissions as well as not requiring open pit mining.  This week they announced the first shipments from their Grota do Cirilo Project in Brazil.  Once ramped up May rival production of larger producers by year end.  SGML performed the best over the past year.

LAC and SGML both have operations that will start production this year and are longer term prospects."

# [Stock futures fall to start week with key inflation data, earnings ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/09/stock-futures-are-down-as-market-exits-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
> Stock futures were lower Monday morning as the markets come out of a tumultuous week and traders look ahead to key reports coming in the next week that can offer insights into the health of the economy.
*****
> Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 28 points. S&P 500 futures were lower by 0.18%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.30%.
*****
> Market observers generally consider the week ahead as the kickoff to earnings season, with four of the world’s largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – reporting Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino’s are also among companies reporting next week.
*****
> Inflation will also take center stage as new monthly Consumer Price Index data comes Thursday morning.
*****
> It will follow a week of whiplash for market participants. The first half of the week brought a relief rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 5% in its largest two-day gain since 2020.
*****
> But jobs data that economists say will keep the Federal Reserve on a path to continue raising interest rates and OPEC+’s decision to slash oil supply rattled investors, knocking the market down later in the week. When trading ended Friday, the S&P was up 1.5% compared to where it started the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
> Still, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq had the first positive week in the last four. All remain down substantially so far in 2022, however, and the Nasdaq is less than 1% away from its 52-week low.
*****
> “The direction of the stock market is likely to be lower because either the economy and corporate profits are going to slow meaningfully or the Fed is going to have to raise rates even higher and keep them higher for longer,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Friday.
*****
> “Given the conditions that we are operating under, we believe it’s prudent to begin preparing for a recession,” he added. “The talk of a shallow recession that is now the narrative-du-jour strikes us as eerily similar to the ‘inflation is transitory’ narrative of last year.”
*****
> Last week brought heightened concerns that corporate earnings will show the ugly side of a surging dollar as Levi Strauss became the latest to cut guidance due to sliding international sales.

I’ve since bought Amazon,  Apple, Tesla, Visa, Norvo Nordisk (NVO) stocks (among others) and have been able to write covered calls averaging about $300 a week in premium.  

I look for CCs with at least one standard deviation from the current price or 85% likelihood of profit with a ~.2 Delta.  I then buy 1-3 stock shares per week with the premium.  

I’ve had a couple of CCs redeemed and I usually just re-buy the same stock and sell new CCs. 

Is this a viable strategy long term?"

I have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:

* Nvidia's advancements is going to ""democratize AI"" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.

* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.

* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.

Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well."

*****
> Due to low trading volumes, investors are expecting either relative quiet or further volatility during the holiday-shortened week. Markets are closing out a month and year defined by a surge in recession fears.

# [Dow futures rise slightly as investors digest corporate earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed on Thursday as traders weighed several key earnings reports.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 93 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.1%.
*****
> Several strong earnings reports were boosting the market, with AT&T, American Airlines and IBM all moving higher in premarket trading after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines for their most recent quarter.
*****
> On the downside, Tesla shares dropped 4% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker said Wednesday evening it expects to miss its 2022 deliveries target. The company also posted a quarterly revenue that missed analyst expectations.
*****
> Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 4.18% on Thursday, briefly trading at levels not seen since 2008. It was last flat for the session near 4.13%. Rising rates have been a headwind for stocks all year, as the Federal Reserve continues to try and cool off inflationary pressures not seen in decades.
*****
> The surge in yields on Thursday contributed to the end of a two-day winning streak for stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding 0.85%. The Dow declined 99.99 points, or 0.33%, and the S&P 500 dipped 0.67%.
*****
> “Despite recent market volatility, central bank tightening expectations have only increased as inflation
readings around the world have continued to come in hot. While there are bound to be more big up &
down days ahead, our intermediate-term bearish base case remains unchanged,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients.
*****
> On the economic front, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey and the weekly jobless claims data are expected Thursday before the bell.

*****
> Stock futures fell slightly on Friday morning as investors looked to close out a winning week for markets that saw better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in market-darling Tesla.
*****
> S&P 500 futures shed 0.28%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat.
*****
> Earnings season continued, with Intel slumped more than 9% premarket following a dismal earnings report that missed on the top and bottom lines. Strong guidance boosted American Express despite a top-and bottom-line miss.
*****
> Stocks rose during regular trading Thursday, cheering a better-than-expected fourth quarter gross domestic product report that stoked hopes that the U.S. economy can experience a soft landing as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame inflation.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 205 points, or 0.61%, notching its fifth consecutive winning session, the first streak of that length since October. The S&P 500 rose 1.10% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.76%.

> All three indexes are positive for the week and month. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.7% and 2.2% this week, respectively. The Nasdaq is up 3.3% on the week and is set to notch its best monthly performance since July. The Nasdaq has gained the last four weeks.
*****
> “This year’s stock market rally is impressive and shouldn’t be ignored,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliancesaid in a Thursday note. ”Unfortunately, the Fed is likely to start talking down the market again, as early as next week, so prepare for volatility again this year; we may be in the eye of the hurricane and not completely out of the woods yet.”
*****
> Tesla closed out Thursday with an 11% gain after earnings and revenue for the last quarter topped expectations and CEO Elon Musk projected the carmaker could possibly produce 2 million cars this year. The widely followed stock was down 65% last year to lead a rout in the growth sector. The shares are up more than 30% this year.
*****
> On Friday, investors will be watching for economic reports that will give more information about the state of inflation. Personal income and spending and pending home sales for December are due in the morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a preferred inflation measurement for the Federal Reserve, is also due. Consumer sentiment for January will also be released.
*****
> It’s some of the last data that will be released ahead of the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Feb. 1. Investors are currently expecting a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike from the central bank.

# [Stock futures are flat following a selloff fueled by Powell’s comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally.
*****
> The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007.
*****
> The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank’s terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks.
*****
> ″[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn’t pan out,” Morgan Stanley’s global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “I think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,” Carpenter added.
*****
> On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January’s job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.

238,Are there any pure plays for the rapid adoption of heat pumps?,8,10l7v7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10l7v7c/are_there_any_pure_plays_for_the_rapid_adoption/,32,1674676301.0,"https://www.achrnews.com/articles/147502-heat-pumps-all-the-buzz-at-electrification-summit

Been seeing more and more heat pump adoption over the tradition emission-heavy boiler rooms. Lots of government policies and funding going towards this transition too.

There are companies like Tesla and Mitsubishi that have small segments with this stuff but likely wouldn’t move the needle."
239,"With sale to AAL, EVTL has potential for stock to takeoff",9,w4jbal,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w4jbal/with_sale_to_aal_evtl_has_potential_for_stock_to/,5,1658416784.0,"I posted this to the r/swingtrading, because I'm and idiot who tries to surf the waves rather than listening to Uncle Warren B. and hodling. But I'd like to post it here as well because I think the longer term potential outweighs the more precise timing of a swing.  

I think that this company is worth a couple of percent of the portfolio as a strategic investment for several reasons. I believe that once their is a bit of a real world track record for the VX4, we will see rapid adoption of these as emergency medical transport, and as replacement for police helicopters. Local governments in urban and suburban areas nationwide deal with regular complaints by their constituents about low flying police chopper noise, especially at night. Once proven reliable in real world settings, the potential uses will spring up faster than mushrooms after a rainstorm.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've  been looking at this company for a bit, and took a small position  yesterday, after I read that American Airlines just ordered 50 of them  with potential follow up orders of 300 more.

I went to their site and took a look at the model in question:

[https://vertical-aerospace.com/vx4/](https://vertical-aerospace.com/vx4/)

Now,  tell me that plane isn't cool, and that platinum or diamond flyers  won't avail themselves the opportunity to skip the crush near baggage  claim and airport traffic to get a ride home. I think products like  these cannot help but capture the public imagination.

Looking  at these kinds of electric vehicles from whatever company 10 years from  now, I can envision pads being leased in commercial parking lots or the  like where density prevents landing directly at the destination. But  shuttling executives to rooftop helipads? No problem.

They  may not be exactly what was promised in The Jetsons yet, but they're  getting closer. By the time density becomes a problem, AI issues such as  Tesla is experiencing will have long before been worked out.

So do what you want with this NFA, coz if I knew anything, I'd be on tv instead of Cramer."
